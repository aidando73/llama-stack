WHITFORD KANE\\n   Ruth Honeywill      Miss EDYTH OLIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT I\\n\\n     The scene is the managing clerk\\'s room, at the offices of James\\n     and Walter How, on a July morning.  The room is old fashioned,\\n     furnished with well-worn  mahogany and leather, and lined with\\n     tin boxes and   estate plans.  It has three doors.  Two of them\\n     are close together in the centre of a wall.  One of these two\\n     doors leads to the outer office, which is only divided from the\\n     managing clerk\\'s room by a   partition of wood and clear glass;\\n     and when the door into this outer office is opened there can be\\n     seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of\\n     the building.  The other of these two   centre doors leads to\\n     the junior clerk\\'s room.  The third door is that leading to the\\n     partners\\' room.\\n\\n     The managing clerk, COKESON, is sitting at his table adding up\\n     figures in a pass-book, and murmuring their numbers to himself.\\n     He is a man of sixty, wearing spectacles; rather short, with a\\n     bald head, and an honest, pugdog face.  He is dressed in a\\n     well-worn black frock-coat and pepper-and-salt trousers.\\n\\nCOKESON.  And five\\'s twelve, and three--fifteen, nineteen,\\ntwenty-three, thirty-two, forty-one-and carry four. [He ticks the\\npage, and goes on murmuring]  Five, seven, twelve, seventeen,\\ntwenty-four and nine, thirty-three, thirteen and carry one.\\n\\n     He again makes a tick.  The outer office door is opened, and\\n     SWEEDLE, the office-boy, appears, closing the door behind him.\\n     He is a pale youth of sixteen, with spiky hair.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With grumpy expectation]  And carry one.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  There\\'s a party wants to see Falder, Mr. Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Five, nine, sixteen, twenty-one, twenty-nine--and carry\\ntwo.  Send him to Morris\\'s.  What name?\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Honeywill.\\n\\nCOKESON.  What\\'s his business?\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  It\\'s a woman.\\n\\nCOKESON.  A lady?\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  No, a person.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ask her in.  Take this pass-book to Mr. James.  [He closes\\nthe pass-book.]\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Reopening the door]  Will you come in, please?\\n\\n     RUTH HONEYWILL comes in.  She is a tall woman, twenty-six years\\n     old, unpretentiously dressed, with black hair and eyes, and an\\n     ivory-white, clear-cut face.  She stands very still, having a\\n     natural dignity of pose and gesture.\\n\\n     SWEEDLE goes out into the partners\\' room with the pass-book.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking round at RUTH]  The young man\\'s out.\\n[Suspiciously]  State your business, please.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Who speaks in a matter-of-fact voice, and with a slight\\nWest-Country accent]  It\\'s a personal matter, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  We don\\'t allow private callers here.  Will you leave a\\nmessage?\\n\\nRUTH.  I\\'d rather see him, please.\\n\\n     She narrows her dark eyes and gives him a honeyed look.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Expanding]  It\\'s all against the rules.  Suppose I had my\\nfriends here to see me!  It\\'d never do!\\n\\nRUTH.  No, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [A little taken aback]  Exactly!  And here you are wanting\\nto see a junior clerk!\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, sir; I must see him.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Turning full round to her with a sort of outraged\\ninterest]  But this is a lawyer\\'s office.  Go to his private address.\\n\\nRUTH.  He\\'s not there.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Uneasy]  Are you related to the party?\\n\\nRUTH.  No, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [In real embarrassment]  I don\\'t know what to say.  It\\'s no\\naffair of the office.\\n\\nRUTH.  But what am I to do?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Dear me!  I can\\'t tell you that.\\n\\n     SWEEDLE comes back.  He crosses to the outer office and passes\\n     through into it, with a quizzical look at Cokeson, carefully\\n     leaving the door an inch or two open.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Fortified by this look]  This won\\'t do, you know, this\\nwon\\'t do at all.  Suppose one of the partners came in!\\n\\n     An incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer\\n     door of the outer office.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Putting his head in]  There\\'s some children outside here.\\n\\nRUTH.  They\\'re mine, please.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Shall I hold them in check?\\n\\nRUTH.  They\\'re quite small, sir. [She takes a step towards COKESON]\\n\\nCOKESON.  You mustn\\'t take up his time in office hours; we\\'re a clerk\\nshort as it is.\\n\\nRUTH.  It\\'s a matter of life and death.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Again outraged]  Life and death!\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Here is Falder.\\n\\n     FALDER has entered through the outer office.  He is a pale,\\n     good-looking young man, with quick, rather scared eyes.  He\\n     moves towards the door of the clerks\\' office, and stands there\\n     irresolute.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Well, I\\'ll give you a minute.  It\\'s not regular.\\n\\n     Taking up a bundle of papers, he goes out into the partners\\'\\n     room.\\n\\nRUTH.  [In a low, hurried voice]  He\\'s on the drink again, Will.  He\\ntried to cut my throat last night.  I came out with the children\\nbefore he was awake.  I went round to you.\\n\\nFALDER.  I\\'ve changed my digs.\\n\\nRUTH.  Is it all ready for to-night?\\n\\nFALDER.  I\\'ve got the tickets.  Meet me 11.45 at the booking office.\\nFor God\\'s sake don\\'t forget we\\'re man and wife!  [Looking at her with\\ntragic intensity]  Ruth!\\n\\nRUTH.  You\\'re not afraid of going, are you?\\n\\nFALDER.  Have you got your things, and the children\\'s?\\n\\nRUTH.  Had to leave them, for fear of waking Honeywill, all but one\\nbag.  I can\\'t go near home again.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Wincing]  All that money gone for nothing.\\nHow much must you have?\\n\\nRUTH.  Six pounds--I could do with that, I think.\\n\\nFALDER.  Don\\'t give away where we\\'re going.  [As if to himself]  When\\nI get out there I mean to forget it all.\\n\\nRUTH.  If you\\'re sorry, say so.  I\\'d sooner he killed me than take\\nyou against your will.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With a queer smile]  We\\'ve got to go.  I don\\'t care; I\\'ll\\nhave you.\\n\\nRUTH.  You\\'ve just to say; it\\'s not too late.\\n\\nFALDER.  It is too late.  Here\\'s seven pounds.  Booking office 11.45\\nto-night.  If you weren\\'t what you are to me, Ruth----!\\n\\nRUTH.  Kiss me!\\n\\n     They cling together passionately, there fly apart just as\\n     COKESON re-enters the room.  RUTH turns and goes out through the\\n     outer office.  COKESON advances deliberately to his chair and\\n     seats himself.\\n\\nCOKESON.  This isn\\'t right, Falder.\\n\\nFALDER.  It shan\\'t occur again, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  It\\'s an improper use of these premises.\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  You quite understand-the party was in some distress; and,\\nhaving children with her, I allowed my feelings----[He opens a\\ndrawer and produces from it a tract]  Just take this!  \"Purity in the\\nHome.\"  It\\'s a well-written thing.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Taking it, with a peculiar expression]  Thank you, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  And look here, Falder, before Mr. Walter comes, have you\\nfinished up that cataloguing Davis had in hand before he left?\\n\\nFALDER.  I shall have done with it to-morrow, sir--for good.\\n\\nCOKESON.  It\\'s over a week since Davis went.  Now it won\\'t do,\\nFalder.  You\\'re neglecting your work for private life.  I shan\\'t\\nmention about the party having called, but----\\n\\nFALDER.  [Passing into his room] Thank you, sir.\\n\\n     COKESON stares at the door through which FALDER has gone out;\\n     then shakes his head, and is just settling down to write, when\\n     WALTER How comes in through the outer Office.  He is a rather\\n     refined-looking man of thirty-five, with a pleasant, almost\\n     apologetic voice.\\n\\nWALTER.  Good-morning, Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Morning, Mr. Walter.\\n\\nWALTER.  My father here?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Always with a certain patronage as to a young man who\\nmight be doing better]  Mr. James has been here since eleven o\\'clock.\\n\\nWALTER.  I\\'ve been in to see the pictures, at the Guildhall.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him as though this were exactly what was to be\\nexpected]  Have you now--ye--es.  This lease of Boulter\\'s--am I to\\nsend it to counsel?\\n\\nWALTER.  What does my father say?\\n\\nCOKESON.  \\'Aven\\'t bothered him.\\n\\nWALTER.  Well, we can\\'t be too careful.\\n\\nCOKESON.  It\\'s such a little thing--hardly worth the fees.  I thought\\nyou\\'d do it yourself.\\n\\nWALTER.  Send it, please.  I don\\'t want the responsibility.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With an indescribable air of compassion]  Just as you\\nlike.  This \"right-of-way\" case--we\\'ve got \\'em on the deeds.\\n\\nWALTER.  I know; but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit\\nof common ground.\\n\\nCOKESON.  We needn\\'t worry about that.  We\\'re the right side of the\\nlaw.\\n\\nWALTER.  I don\\'t like it,\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With an indulgent smile]  We shan\\'t want to set ourselves\\nup against the law.  Your father wouldn\\'t waste his time doing that.\\n\\n     As he speaks JAMES How comes in from the partners\\' room.  He is\\n     a shortish man, with white side-whiskers, plentiful grey hair,\\n     shrewd eyes, and gold pince-nez.\\n\\nJAMES.  Morning, Walter.\\n\\nWALTER.  How are you, father?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking down his nose at the papers in his hand as though\\ndeprecating their size] I\\'ll just take Boulter\\'s lease in to young\\nFalder to draft the instructions. [He goes out into FALDER\\'S room.]\\n\\nWALTER.  About that right-of-way case?\\n\\nJAMES.  Oh, well, we must go forward there.  I thought you told me\\nyesterday the firm\\'s balance was over four hundred.\\n\\nWALTER.  So it is.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Holding out the pass-book to his son] Three--five--one, no\\nrecent cheques.  Just get me out the cheque-book.\\n\\n     WALTER goes to a cupboard, unlocks a drawer and produces a\\n     cheque-book.\\n\\nJAMES.  Tick the pounds in the counterfoils.  Five, fifty-four,\\nseven, five, twenty-eight, twenty, ninety, eleven, fifty-two,\\nseventy-one.  Tally?\\n\\nWALTER.  [Nodding]  Can\\'t understand.  Made sure it was over four\\nhundred.\\n\\nJAMES.  Give me the cheque-book.  [He takes the check-book and cons\\nthe counterfoils] What\\'s this ninety?\\n\\nWALTER.  Who drew it?\\n\\nJAMES.  You.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Taking the cheque-book]  July 7th?  That\\'s the day I went\\ndown to look over the Trenton Estate--last Friday week; I came back\\non the Tuesday, you remember.  But look here, father, it was nine I\\ndrew a cheque for.  Five guineas to Smithers and my expenses.  It\\njust covered all but half a crown.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Gravely]  Let\\'s look at that ninety cheque.  [He sorts the\\ncheque out from the bundle in the pocket of the pass-book] Seems all\\nright.  There\\'s no nine here.  This is bad.  Who cashed that\\nnine-pound cheque?\\n\\nWALTER.  [Puzzled and pained]  Let\\'s see!  I was finishing Mrs.\\nReddy\\'s will--only just had time; yes--I gave it to Cokeson.\\n\\nJAMES.  Look at that \\'t\\' \\'y\\': that yours?\\n\\nWALTER.  [After consideration]  My y\\'s curl back a little; this\\ndoesn\\'t.\\n\\nJAMES.  [As COKESON re-enters from FALDER\\'S room]  We must ask him.\\nJust come here and carry your mind back a bit, Cokeson.  D\\'you\\nremember cashing a cheque for Mr. Walter last Friday week--the day\\nhe went to Trenton?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.  Nine pounds.\\n\\nJAMES.  Look at this.  [Handing him the cheque.]\\n\\nCOKESON.  No!  Nine pounds.  My lunch was just coming in; and of\\ncourse I like it hot; I gave the cheque to Davis to run round to the\\nbank.  He brought it back, all gold--you remember, Mr. Walter, you\\nwanted some silver to pay your cab.  [With a certain contemptuous\\ncompassion]  Here, let me see.  You\\'ve got the wrong cheque.\\n\\n     He takes cheque-book and pass-book from WALTER.\\n\\nWALTER.  Afraid not.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Having seen for himself]  It\\'s funny.\\n\\nJAMES.  You gave it to Davis, and Davis sailed for Australia on\\nMonday.  Looks black, Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Puzzled and upset]  why this\\'d be a felony!  No, no!\\nthere\\'s some mistake.\\n\\nJAMES.  I hope so.\\n\\nCOKESON.  There\\'s never been anything of that sort in the office the\\ntwenty-nine years I\\'ve been here.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Looking at cheque and counterfoil]  This is a very clever\\nbit of work; a warning to you not to leave space after your figures,\\nWalter.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Vexed]  Yes, I know--I was in such a tearing hurry that\\nafternoon.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Suddenly]  This has upset me.\\n\\nJAMES.  The counterfoil altered too--very deliberate piece of\\nswindling.  What was Davis\\'s ship?\\n\\nWALTER.  \\'City of Rangoon\\'.\\n\\nJAMES.  We ought to wire and have him arrested at Naples; he can\\'t be\\nthere yet.\\n\\nCOKESON.  His poor young wife.  I liked the young man.  Dear, oh\\ndear!  In this office!\\n\\nWALTER.  Shall I go to the bank and ask the cashier?\\n\\nJAMES.  [Grimly]  Bring him round here.  And ring up Scotland Yard.\\n\\nWALTER.  Really?\\n\\n     He goes out through the outer office.  JAMES paces the room.  He\\n     stops and looks at COKESON, who is disconsolately rubbing the\\n     knees of his trousers.\\n\\nJAMES.  Well, Cokeson!  There\\'s something in character, isn\\'t there?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him over his spectacles]  I don\\'t quite take\\nyou, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  Your story, would sound d----d thin to any one who didn\\'t\\nknow you.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es!  [He laughs.  Then with a sudden gravity]  I\\'m sorry\\nfor that young man.  I feel it as if it was my own son, Mr. James.\\n\\nJAMES.  A nasty business!\\n\\nCOKESON.  It unsettles you.  All goes on regular, and then a thing\\nlike this happens.  Shan\\'t relish my lunch to-day.\\n\\nJAMES.  As bad as that, Cokeson?\\n\\nCOKESON.  It makes you think.  [Confidentially]  He must have had\\ntemptation.\\n\\nJAMES.  Not so fast.  We haven\\'t convicted him yet.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'d sooner have lost a month\\'s salary than had this happen.\\n    [He broods.]\\n\\nJAMES.  I hope that fellow will hurry up.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Keeping things pleasant for the cashier]  It isn\\'t fifty\\nyards, Mr. James.  He won\\'t be a minute.\\n\\nJAMES.  The idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard,\\nCokeson.\\n\\n     He goes towards the door of the partners\\' room.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Entering quietly, to COKESON in a low voice]  She\\'s popped\\nup again, sir-something she forgot to say to Falder.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Roused from his abstraction]  Eh?  Impossible.  Send her\\naway!\\n\\nJAMES.  What\\'s that?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Nothing, Mr. James.  A private matter.  Here, I\\'ll come\\nmyself.  [He goes into the outer office as JAMES passes into the\\npartners\\' room]  Now, you really mustn\\'t--we can\\'t have anybody just\\nnow.\\n\\nRUTH.  Not for a minute, sir?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Reely!  Reely!  I can\\'t have it.  If you want him, wait\\nabout; he\\'ll be going out for his lunch directly.\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, sir.\\n\\n     WALTER, entering with the cashier, passes RUTH as she leaves the\\n     outer office.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [To the cashier, who resembles a sedentary dragoon]\\nGood-morning.  [To WALTER]  Your father\\'s in there.\\n\\n     WALTER crosses and goes into the partners\\' room.\\n\\nCOKESON.  It\\'s a nahsty, unpleasant little matter, Mr. Cowley.  I\\'m\\nquite ashamed to have to trouble you.\\n\\nCOWLEY.  I remember the cheque quite well.  [As if it were a liver]\\nSeemed in perfect order.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Sit down, won\\'t you?  I\\'m not a sensitive man, but a thing\\nlike this about the place--it\\'s not nice.  I like people to be open\\nand jolly together.\\n\\nCOWLEY.  Quite so.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Buttonholing him, and glancing toward the partners\\' room]\\nOf course he\\'s a young man.  I\\'ve told him about it before now--\\nleaving space after his figures, but he will do it.\\n\\nCOWLEY.  I should remember the person\\'s face--quite a youth.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I don\\'t think we shall be able to show him to you, as a\\nmatter of fact.\\n\\n     JAMES and WALTER have come back from the partners\\' room.\\n\\nJAMES.  Good-morning, Mr. Cowley.  You\\'ve seen my son and myself,\\nyou\\'ve seen Mr. Cokeson, and you\\'ve seen Sweedle, my office-boy.  It\\nwas none of us, I take it.\\n\\n     The cashier shakes his head with a smile.\\n\\nJAMES.  Be so good as to sit there.  Cokeson, engage Mr. Cowley in\\nconversation, will you?\\n\\n     He goes toward FALDER\\'S room.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Just a word, Mr. James.\\n\\nJAMES.  Well?\\n\\nCOKESON.  You don\\'t want to upset the young man in there, do you?\\nHe\\'s a nervous young feller.\\n\\nJAMES.  This must be thoroughly cleared up, Cokeson, for the sake of\\nFalder\\'s name, to say nothing of yours.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With Some dignity] That\\'ll look after itself, sir.  He\\'s\\nbeen upset once this morning; I don\\'t want him startled again.\\n\\nJAMES.  It\\'s a matter of form; but I can\\'t stand upon niceness over a\\nthing like this--too serious.  Just talk to Mr. Cowley.\\n\\n     He opens the door of FALDER\\'S room.\\n\\nJAMES.  Bring in the papers in Boulter\\'s lease, will you, Falder?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Bursting into voice]  Do you keep dogs?\\n\\n     The cashier, with his eyes fixed on the door, does not answer.\\n\\nCOKESON.  You haven\\'t such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare\\nme, I suppose?\\n\\n     At the look on the cashier\\'s face his jaw drops, and he turns to\\n     see FALDER standing in the doorway, with his eyes fixed on\\n     COWLEY, like the eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Advancing with the papers] Here they are, sir!\\n\\nJAMES.  [Taking them] Thank you.\\n\\nFALDER.  Do you want me, sir?\\n\\nJAMES.  No, thanks!\\n\\n     FALDER turns and goes back into his own room.  As he shuts the\\n     door JAMES gives the cashier an interrogative look, and the\\n     cashier nods.\\n\\nJAMES.  Sure?  This isn\\'t as we suspected.\\n\\nCOWLEY.  Quite.  He knew me.  I suppose he can\\'t slip out of that\\nroom?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Gloomily]  There\\'s only the window--a whole floor and a\\nbasement.\\n\\n     The door of FALDER\\'S room is quietly opened, and FALDER, with\\n     his hat in his hand, moves towards the door of the outer office.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Quietly]  Where are you going, Falder?\\n\\nFALDER.  To have my lunch, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  Wait a few minutes, would you?  I want to speak to you about\\nthis lease.\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, sir.  [He goes back into his room.]\\n\\nCOWLEY.  If I\\'m wanted, I can swear that\\'s the young man who cashed\\nthe cheque.  It was the last cheque I handled that morning before my\\nlunch.  These are the numbers of the notes he had.  [He puts a slip\\nof paper on the table; then, brushing his hat round]  Good-morning!\\n\\nJAMES.  Good-morning, Mr. Cowley!\\n\\nCOWLEY.  [To COKESON]  Good-morning.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With Stupefaction]  Good-morning.\\n\\n     The cashier goes out through the outer office. COKESON sits down\\n     in his chair, as though it were the only place left in the\\n     morass of his feelings.\\n\\nWALTER.  What are you going to do?\\n\\nJAMES.  Have him in.  Give me the cheque and the counterfoil.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I don\\'t understand.  I thought young Davis----\\n\\nJAMES.  We shall see.\\n\\nWALTER.  One moment, father: have you thought it out?\\n\\nJAMES.  Call him in!\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Rising with difficulty and opening FALDER\\'S door;\\nhoarsely]  Step in here a minute.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Impassively]  Yes, sir?\\n\\nJAMES.  [Turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out]  You know\\nthis cheque, Falder?\\n\\nFALDER.  No, sir.\\n\\nJADES.  Look at it.  You cashed it last Friday week.\\n\\nFALDER.  Oh! yes, sir; that one--Davis gave it me.\\n\\nJAMES.  I know. And you gave Davis the cash?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  When Davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, I think so, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  You know that Mr. Walter drew that cheque for nine pounds?\\n\\nFALDER.  No, sir--ninety.\\n\\nJAMES.  Nine, Falder.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  I don\\'t understand, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  The suggestion, of course, is that the cheque was altered;\\nwhether by you or Davis is the question.\\n\\nFALDER.  I--I\\n\\nCOKESON.  Take your time, take your time.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Regaining his impassivity]  Not by me, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  The cheque was handed to--Cokeson by Mr. Walter at one\\no\\'clock; we know that because Mr. Cokeson\\'s lunch had just arrived.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I couldn\\'t leave it.\\n\\nJAMES.  Exactly; he therefore gave the cheque to Davis.  It was\\ncashed by you at 1.15.  We know that because the cashier recollects\\nit for the last cheque he handled before his lunch.\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, sir, Davis gave it to me because some friends were\\ngiving him a farewell luncheon.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Puzzled] You accuse Davis, then?\\n\\nFALDER.  I don\\'t know, sir--it\\'s very funny.\\n\\n     WALTER, who has come close to his father, says something to him\\n     in a low voice.\\n\\nJAMES.  Davis was not here again after that Saturday, was he?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Anxious to be of assistance to the young man, and seeing\\nfaint signs of their all being jolly once more] No, he sailed on the\\nMonday.\\n\\nJAMES.  Was he, Falder?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Very faintly]  No, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  Very well, then, how do you account for the fact that this\\nnought was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after Tuesday?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Surprised]  How\\'s that?\\n\\n     FALDER gives a sort of lurch; he tries to pull himself together,\\n     but he has gone all to pieces.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Very grimly]  Out, I\\'m afraid, Cokeson.  The cheque-book\\nremained in Mr. Walter\\'s pocket till he came back from Trenton on\\nTuesday morning.  In the face of this, Falder, do you still deny that\\nyou altered both cheque and counterfoil?\\n\\nFALDER.  No, sir--no, Mr. How.  I did it, sir; I did it.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Succumbing to his feelings]  Dear, dear! what a thing to\\ndo!\\n\\nFALDER.  I wanted the money so badly, sir.  I didn\\'t know what I was\\ndoing.\\n\\nCOKESON.  However such a thing could have come into your head!\\n\\nFALDER.  [Grasping at the words]  I can\\'t think, sir, really!  It was\\njust a minute of madness.\\n\\nJAMES.  A long minute, Falder.  [Tapping the counterfoil] Four days\\nat least.\\n\\nFALDER.  Sir, I swear I didn\\'t know what I\\'d done till afterwards,\\nand then I hadn\\'t the pluck.  Oh!  Sir, look over it!  I\\'ll pay the\\nmoney back--I will, I promise.\\n\\nJAMES.  Go into your room.\\n\\n     FALDER, with a swift imploring look, goes back into his room.\\n     There is silence.\\n\\nJAMES.  About as bad a case as there could be.\\n\\nCOKESON.  To break the law like that-in here!\\n\\nWALTER.  What\\'s to be done?\\n\\nJAMES.  Nothing for it.  Prosecute.\\n\\nWALTER.  It\\'s his first offence.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Shaking his head]  I\\'ve grave doubts of that.  Too neat a\\npiece of swindling altogether.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I shouldn\\'t be surprised if he was tempted.\\n\\nJAMES.  Life\\'s one long temptation, Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, but I\\'m speaking of the flesh and the devil, Mr.\\nJames.  There was a woman come to see him this morning.\\n\\nWALTER.  The woman we passed as we came in just now.  Is it his wife?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No, no relation.  [Restraining what in jollier\\ncircumstances would have been a wink]  A married person, though.\\n\\nWALTER.  How do you know?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Brought her children.  [Scandalised]  There they were\\noutside the office.\\n\\nJAMES.  A real bad egg.\\n\\nWALTER.  I should like to give him a chance.\\n\\nJAMES.  I can\\'t forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work--\\ncounting on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light.\\nIt was the merest accident the cheque-book stayed in your pocket.\\n\\nWALTER.  It must have been the temptation of a moment.  He hadn\\'t\\ntime.\\n\\nJAMES.  A man doesn\\'t succumb like that in a moment, if he\\'s a clean\\nmind and habits.  He\\'s rotten; got the eyes of a man who can\\'t keep\\nhis hands off when there\\'s money about.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Dryly] We hadn\\'t noticed that before.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Brushing the remark aside] I\\'ve seen lots of those fellows\\nin my time.  No doing anything with them except to keep \\'em out of\\nharm\\'s way.  They\\'ve got a blind spat.\\n\\nWALTER.  It\\'s penal servitude.\\n\\nCOKESON.  They\\'re nahsty places-prisons.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Hesitating] I don\\'t see how it\\'s possible to spare him.  Out\\nof the question to keep him in this office--honesty\\'s the \\'sine qua\\nnon\\'.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Hypnotised] Of course it is.\\n\\nJAMES.  Equally out of the question to send him out amongst people\\nwho\\'ve no knowledge of his character.  One must think of society.\\n\\nWALTER.  But to brand him like this?\\n\\nJAMES.  If it had been a straightforward case I\\'d give him another\\nchance.  It\\'s far from that.  He has dissolute habits.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I didn\\'t say that--extenuating circumstances.\\n\\nJAMES.  Same thing.  He\\'s gone to work in the most cold-blooded way\\nto defraud his employers, and cast the blame on an innocent man.  If\\nthat\\'s not a case for the law to take its course, I don\\'t know what\\nis.\\n\\nWALTER.  For the sake of his future, though.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Sarcastically]  According to you, no one would ever\\nprosecute.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Nettled]  I hate the idea of it.\\n\\nCOKESON.  That\\'s rather \\'ex parte\\', Mr. Walter!  We must have\\nprotection.\\n\\nJAMES.  This is degenerating into talk.\\n\\n     He moves towards the partners\\' room.\\n\\nWALTER.  Put yourself in his place, father.\\n\\nJAMES.  You ask too much of me.\\n\\nWALTER.  We can\\'t possibly tell the pressure there was on him.\\n\\nJAMES.  You may depend on it, my boy, if a man is going to do this\\nsort of thing he\\'ll do it, pressure or no pressure; if he isn\\'t\\nnothing\\'ll make him.\\n\\nWALTER.  He\\'ll never do it again.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Fatuously] S\\'pose I were to have a talk with him.  We\\ndon\\'t want to be hard on the young man.\\n\\nJAMES.  That\\'ll do, Cokeson.  I\\'ve made up my mind.  [He passes into\\nthe partners\\' room.]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [After a doubtful moment]  We must excuse your father.  I\\ndon\\'t want to go against your father; if he thinks it right.\\n\\nWALTER.  Confound it, Cokeson! why don\\'t you back me up?  You know\\nyou feel----\\n\\nCOKESON.  [On his dignity]  I really can\\'t say what I feel.\\n\\nWALTER.  We shall regret it.\\n\\nCOKESON.  He must have known what he was doing.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Bitterly]  \"The quality of mercy is not strained.\"\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him askance]  Come, come, Mr. Walter.  We must\\ntry and see it sensible.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Entering with a tray] Your lunch, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Put it down!\\n\\n     While SWEEDLE is putting it down on COKESON\\'s table, the\\n     detective, WISTER, enters the outer office, and, finding no one\\n     there, comes to the inner doorway.  He is a square, medium-sized\\n     man, clean-shaved, in a serviceable blue serge suit and strong\\n     boots.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Hoarsely]  Here!  Here!  What are we doing?\\n\\nWISTER.  [To WALTER]  From Scotland Yard, sir.  Detective-Sergeant\\nBlister.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Askance] Very well!  I\\'ll speak to my father.\\n\\n     He goes into the partners\\' room.  JAMES enters.\\n\\nJAMES.  Morning!  [In answer to an appealing gesture from COKESON]\\nI\\'m sorry; I\\'d stop short of this if I felt I could.  Open that door.\\n[SWEEDLE, wondering and scared, opens it] Come here, Mr. Falder.\\n\\n     As FALDER comes shrinkingly out, the detective in obedience to a\\n     sign from JAMES, slips his hand out and grasps his arm.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Recoiling] Oh! no,--oh! no!\\n\\nWALTER.  Come, come, there\\'s a good lad.\\n\\nJAMES.  I charge him with felony.\\n\\nFALTER.  Oh, sir!  There\\'s some one--I did it for her.  Let me be\\ntill to-morrow.\\n\\n     JAMES motions with his hand.  At that sign of hardness, FALDER\\n     becomes rigid.  Then, turning, he goes out quietly in the\\n     detective\\'s grip.  JAMES follows, stiff and erect.  SWEEDLE,\\n     rushing to the door with open mouth, pursues them through the\\n     outer office into the corridor.  When they have all disappeared\\n     COKESON spins completely round and makes a rush for the outer\\n     office.\\n\\nCOKESON: [Hoarsely] Here!  What are we doing?\\n\\n     There is silence.  He takes out his handkerchief and mops the\\n     sweat from his face.  Going back blindly to his table, sits\\n     down, and stares blankly at his lunch.\\n\\n\\n                         The curtain falls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT II\\n\\nA Court of Justice, on a foggy October afternoon crowded with\\nbarristers, solicitors, reporters, ushers, and jurymen.  Sitting in\\nthe large, solid dock is FALDER, with a warder on either side of him,\\nplaced there for his safe custody, but seemingly indifferent to and\\nunconscious of his presence.  FALDER is sitting exactly opposite to\\nthe JUDGE, who, raised above the clamour of the court, also seems\\nunconscious of and indifferent to everything.  HAROLD CLEAVER, the\\ncounsel for the Crown, is a dried, yellowish man, of more than middle\\nage, in a wig worn almost to the colour of his face.  HECTOR FROME,\\nthe counsel for the defence, is a young, tall man, clean shaved, in a\\nvery white wig.  Among the spectators,  having already given their\\nevidence, are JAMES and WALTER HOW, and COWLEY, the cashier.  WISTER,\\nthe detective, is just leaving the witness-box.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  That is the case for the Crown, me lud!\\n\\n     Gathering his robes together, he sits down.\\n\\nFROME.  [Rising and bowing to the JUDGE] If it please your lordship\\nand gentlemen of the jury.  I am not going to dispute the fact that\\nthe prisoner altered this cheque, but I am going to put before you\\nevidence as to the condition of his mind, and to submit that you\\nwould not be justified in finding that he was responsible for his\\nactions at the time.  I am going to show you, in fact, that he did\\nthis in a moment of aberration, amounting to temporary insanity,\\ncaused by the violent distress under which he was labouring.\\nGentlemen, the prisoner is only twenty-three years old.  I shall call\\nbefore you a woman from whom you will learn the events that led up to\\nthis act.  You will hear from her own lips the tragic circumstances\\nof her life, the still more tragic infatuation with which she has\\ninspired the prisoner.  This woman, gentlemen, has been leading a\\nmiserable existence with a husband who habitually ill-uses her, from\\nwhom she actually goes in terror of her life.  I am not, of course,\\nsaying that it\\'s either right or desirable for a young man to fall in\\nlove with a married woman, or that it\\'s his business to rescue her\\nfrom an ogre-like husband.  I\\'m not saying anything of the sort.  But\\nwe all know the power of the passion of love; and I would ask you to\\nremember, gentlemen, in listening to her evidence, that, married to a\\ndrunken and violent husband, she has no power to get rid of him; for,\\nas you know, another offence besides violence is necessary to enable\\na woman to obtain a divorce; and of this offence it does not appear\\nthat her husband is guilty.\\n\\nJUDGE.  Is this relevant, Mr. Frome?\\n\\nFROME.  My lord, I submit, extremely--I shall be able to show your\\nlordship that directly.\\n\\nJUDGE.  Very well.\\n\\nFROME.  In these circumstances, what alternatives were left to her?\\nShe could either go on living with this drunkard, in terror of her\\nlife; or she could apply to the Court for a separation order.  Well,\\ngentlemen, my experience of such cases assures me that this would\\nhave given her very insufficient protection from the violence of such\\na man; and even if effectual would very likely have reduced her\\neither to the workhouse or the streets--for it\\'s not easy, as she is\\nnow finding, for an unskilled woman without means of livelihood to\\nsupport herself and her children without resorting either to the Poor\\nLaw or--to speak quite plainly--to the sale of her body.\\n\\nJUDGE.  You are ranging rather far, Mr. Frome.\\n\\nFROME.  I shall fire point-blank in a minute, my lord.\\n\\nJUDGE.  Let us hope so.\\n\\nFROME.  Now, gentlemen, mark--and this is what I have been leading up\\nto--this woman will tell you, and the prisoner will confirm her,\\nthat, confronted with such alternatives, she set her whole hopes on\\nhimself, knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him.  She\\nsaw a way out of her misery by going with him to a new country, where\\nthey would both be unknown, and might pass as husband and wife.  This\\nwas a desperate and, as my friend Mr. Cleaver will no doubt call it,\\nan immoral resolution; but, as a fact, the minds of both of them were\\nconstantly turned towards it.  One wrong is no excuse for another,\\nand those who are never likely to be faced by such a situation\\npossibly have the right to hold up their hands--as to that I prefer\\nto say nothing.  But whatever view you take, gentlemen, of this part\\nof the prisoner\\'s story--whatever opinion you form of the right of\\nthese two young people under such circumstances to take the law into\\ntheir own hands--the fact remains that this young woman in her\\ndistress, and this young man, little more than a boy, who was so\\ndevotedly attached to her, did conceive this--if you like--\\nreprehensible design of going away together.  Now, for that, of\\ncourse, they required money, and--they had none.  As to the actual\\nevents of the morning of July 7th, on which this cheque was altered,\\nthe events on which I rely to prove the defendant\\'s irresponsibility\\n--I shall allow those events to speak for themselves, through the\\nlips of my witness.  Robert Cokeson.  [He turns, looks round, takes\\nup a sheet of paper, and waits.]\\n\\n     COKESON is summoned into court, and goes into the witness-box,\\n     holding his hat before him.  The oath is administered to him.\\n\\nFROME.  What is your name?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Robert Cokeson.\\n\\nFROME.  Are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ\\nthe prisoner?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.\\n\\nFROME.  How long had the prisoner been in their employ?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Two years.  No, I\\'m wrong there--all but seventeen days.\\n\\nFROME.  Had you him under your eye all that time?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Except Sundays and holidays.\\n\\nFROME.  Quite so.  Let us hear, please, what you have to say about\\nhis general character during those two years.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially to the jury, and as if a little surprised\\nat being asked]  He was a nice, pleasant-spoken young man.  I\\'d no\\nfault to find with him--quite the contrary.  It was a great surprise\\nto me when he did a thing like that.\\n\\nFROME.  Did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No!  To have dishonesty in our office, that\\'d never do.\\n\\nFROME.  I\\'m sure the jury fully appreciate that, Mr. Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Every man of business knows that honesty\\'s \\'the sign qua\\nnon\\'.\\n\\nFROME.  Do you give him a good character all round, or do you not?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Turning to the JUDGE]  Certainly.  We were all very jolly\\nand pleasant together, until this happened.  Quite upset me.\\n\\nFROME.  Now, coming to the morning of the 7th of July, the morning on\\nwhich the cheque was altered.  What have you to say about his\\ndemeanour that morning?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [To the jury]  If you ask me, I don\\'t think he was quite\\ncompos when he did it.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Sharply]  Are you suggesting that he was insane?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Not compos.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  A little more precision, please.\\n\\nFROME.  [Smoothly]  Just tell us, Mr. Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Somewhat outraged]  Well, in my opinion--[looking at the\\nJUDGE]--such as it is--he was jumpy at the time.  The jury will\\nunderstand my meaning.\\n\\nFROME.  Will you tell us how you came to that conclusion?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, I will.  I have my lunch in from the restaurant, a\\nchop and a potato--saves time.  That day it happened to come just as\\nMr. Walter How handed me the cheque.  Well, I like it hot; so I went\\ninto the clerks\\' office and I handed the cheque to Davis, the other\\nclerk, and told him to get change.  I noticed young Falder walking up\\nand down.  I said to him: \"This is not the Zoological Gardens,\\nFalder.\"\\n\\nFROME.  Do you remember what he answered?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es: \"I wish to God it were!\"  Struck me as funny.\\n\\nFROME.  Did you notice anything else peculiar?\\n\\nCOKESON.  I did.\\n\\nFROME.  What was that?\\n\\nCOKESON.  His collar was unbuttoned.  Now, I like a young man to be\\nneat.  I said to him: \"Your collar\\'s unbuttoned.\"\\n\\nFROME.  And what did he answer?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Stared at me.  It wasn\\'t nice.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Stared at you?  Isn\\'t that a very common practice?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, but it was the look in his eyes.  I can\\'t explain my\\nmeaning--it was funny.\\n\\nFROME.  Had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No.  If I had I should have spoken to the partners.  We\\ncan\\'t have anything eccentric in our profession.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Did you speak to them on that occasion?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially]  Well, I didn\\'t like to trouble them about\\nprime facey evidence.\\n\\nFROME.  But it made a very distinct impression on your mind?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.  The clerk Davis could have told you the same.\\n\\nFROME.  Quite so.  It\\'s very unfortunate that we\\'ve not got him here.\\nNow can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the\\nforgery was made?  That would be the 18th.  Did anything happen that\\nmorning?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With his hand to his ear]  I\\'m a little deaf.\\n\\nFROME.  Was there anything in the course of that morning--I mean\\nbefore the discovery--that caught your attention?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es--a woman.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  How is this relevant, Mr. Frome?\\n\\nFROME.  I am trying to establish the state of mind in which the\\nprisoner committed this act, my lord.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  I quite appreciate that.  But this was long after the\\nact.\\n\\nFROME.  Yes, my lord, but it contributes to my contention.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Well!\\n\\nFROME.  You say a woman.  Do you mean that she came to the office?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.\\n\\nFROME.  What for?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Asked to see young Falder; he was out at the moment.\\n\\nFROME.  Did you see her?\\n\\nCOKESON.  I did.\\n\\nFROME.  Did she come alone?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially]  Well, there you put me in a difficulty.\\nI mustn\\'t tell you what the office-boy told me.\\n\\nFROME.  Quite so, Mr. Cokeson, quite so----\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Breaking in with an air of \"You are young--leave it to\\nme\"]  But I think we can get round it.  In answer to a question put\\nto her by a third party the woman said to me: \"They\\'re mine, sir.\"\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  What are?  What were?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Her children.  They were outside.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  HOW do you know?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Your lordship mustn\\'t ask me that, or I shall have to tell\\nyou what I was told--and that\\'d never do.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Smiling]  The office-boy made a statement.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Egg-zactly.\\n\\nFROME.  What I want to ask you, Mr. Cokeson, is this.  In the course\\nof her appeal to see Falder, did the woman say anything that you\\nspecially remember?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the\\nsentence]  A leetle more, sir.\\n\\nFROME.  Or did she not?\\n\\nCOKESON.  She did.  I shouldn\\'t like you to have led me to the\\nanswer.\\n\\nFROME.  [With an irritated smile]  Will you tell the jury what it\\nwas?\\n\\nCOKESON.  \"It\\'s a matter of life and death.\"\\n\\nFOREMAN OF THE JURY.  Do you mean the woman said that?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Nodding]  It\\'s not the sort of thing you like to have said\\nto you.\\n\\nFROME.  [A little impatiently]  Did Falder come in while she was\\nthere?  [COKESON nods]  And she saw him, and went away?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ah!  there I can\\'t follow you.  I didn\\'t see her go.\\n\\nFROME.  Well, is she there now?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With an indulgent smile]  No!\\n\\nFROME.  Thank you, Mr. Cokeson.  [He sits down.]\\n\\nCLEAVER.  [Rising] You say that on the morning of the forgery the\\nprisoner was jumpy.  Well, now, sir, what precisely do you mean by\\nthat word?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Indulgently]  I want you to understand.  Have you ever\\nseen a dog that\\'s lost its master?  He was kind of everywhere at once\\nwith his eyes.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Thank you; I was coming to his eyes.  You called them\\n\"funny.\"  What are we to understand by that?  Strange, or what?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, funny.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Sharply]  Yes, sir, but what may be funny to you may not\\nbe funny to me, or to the jury.  Did they look frightened, or shy, or\\nfierce, or what?\\n\\nCOKESON.  You make it very hard for me.  I give you the word, and you\\nwant me to give you another.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  [Rapping his desk] Does \"funny\" mean mad?\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Not mad, fun----\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Very well!  Now you say he had his collar unbuttoned?  Was\\nit a hot day?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es; I think it was.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  And did he button it when you called his attention to it?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, I think he did.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Would you say that that denoted insanity?\\n\\n     He sits downs.  COKESON, who has opened his mouth to reply, is\\n     left gaping.\\n\\nFROME.  [Rising hastily] Have you ever caught him in that dishevelled\\nstate before?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No!  He was always clean and quiet.\\n\\nFROME.  That will do, thank you.\\n\\n     COKESON turns blandly to the JUDGE, as though to rebuke counsel\\n     for not remembering that the JUDGE might wish to have a chance;\\n     arriving at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing\\n     further, he turns and descends from the box, and sits down next\\n     to JAMES and WALTER.\\n\\nFROME.  Ruth Honeywill.\\n\\n     RUTH comes into court, and takes her stand stoically in the\\n     witness-box.  She is sworn.\\n\\nFROME.  What is your name, please?\\n\\nRUTH.  Ruth Honeywill.\\n\\nFROME.  How old are you?\\n\\nRUTH.  Twenty-six.\\n\\nFROME.  You are a married woman, living with your husband?  A little\\nlouder.\\n\\nRUTH.  No, sir; not since July.\\n\\nFROME.  Have you any children?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, sir, two.\\n\\nFROME.  Are they living with you?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, sir.\\n\\nFROME.  You know the prisoner?\\n\\nRUTH. [Looking at him]  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  What was the nature of your relations with him?\\n\\nRUTH.  We were friends.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Friends?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Simply]  Lovers, sir.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Sharply]  In what sense do you use that word?\\n\\nRUTH.  We love each other.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Yes, but----\\n\\nRUTH.  [Shaking her head]  No, your lordship--not yet.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  \\'Not yet!  H\\'m!  [He looks from RUTH to FALDER]  Well!\\n\\nFROME.  What is your husband?\\n\\nRUTH.  Traveller.\\n\\nFROME.  And what was the nature of your married life?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Shaking her head]  It don\\'t bear talking about.\\n\\nFROME.  Did he ill-treat you, or what?\\n\\nRUTH.  Ever since my first was born.\\n\\nFROME.  In what way?\\n\\nRUTH.  I\\'d rather not say.  All sorts of ways.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  I am afraid I must stop this, you know.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Pointing to FALDER]  He offered to take me out of it, sir.\\nWe were going to South America.\\n\\nFROME.  [Hastily]  Yes, quite--and what prevented you?\\n\\nRUTH.  I was outside his office when he was taken away.  It nearly\\nbroke my heart.\\n\\nFROME.  You knew, then, that he had been arrested?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, sir.  I called at his office afterwards, and  [pointing\\nto COKESON] that gentleman told me all about it.\\n\\nFROME.  Now, do you remember the morning of Friday, July 7th?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  Why?\\n\\nRUTH.  My husband nearly strangled me that morning.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Nearly strangled you!\\n\\nRUTH.  [Bowing her head] Yes, my lord.\\n\\nFROME.  With his hands, or----?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, I just managed to get away from him.  I went straight to\\nmy friend.  It was eight o\\'clock.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  In the morning?  Your husband was not under the influence\\nof liquor then?\\n\\nRUTH.  It wasn\\'t always that.\\n\\nFROME.  In what condition were you?\\n\\nRUTH.  In very bad condition, sir.  My dress was torn, and I was half\\nchoking.\\n\\nFROME.  Did you tell your friend what had happened?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.  I wish I never had.\\n\\nFROME.  It upset him?\\n\\nRUTH.  Dreadfully.\\n\\nFROME.  Did he ever speak to you about a cheque?\\n\\nRUTH.  Never.\\n\\nFROZE.  Did he ever give you any money?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  When was that?\\n\\nRUTH.  On Saturday.\\n\\nFROME.  The 8th?\\n\\nRUTH.  To buy an outfit for me and the children, and get all ready to\\nstart.\\n\\nFROME.  Did that surprise you, or not?\\n\\nRUTH.  What, sir?\\n\\nFROME.  That he had money to give you.\\n\\nRing.  Yes, because on the morning when my husband nearly killed me\\nmy friend cried because he hadn\\'t the money to get me away.  He told\\nme afterwards he\\'d come into a windfall.\\n\\nFROME.  And when did you last see him?\\n\\nRUTH.  The day he was taken away, sir.  It was the day we were to\\nhave started.\\n\\nFROME.  Oh, yes, the morning of the arrest.  Well, did you see him at\\nall between the Friday and that morning?  [RUTH nods]  What was his\\nmanner then?\\n\\nRUTH.  Dumb--like--sometimes he didn\\'t seem able to say a word.\\n\\nFROME.  As if something unusual had happened to him?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  Painful, or pleasant, or what?\\n\\nRUTH.  Like a fate hanging over him.\\n\\nFROME.  [Hesitating]  Tell me, did you love the prisoner very much?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Bowing her head]  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  And had he a very great affection for you?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Looking at FALDER]  Yes, sir.\\n\\nFROME.  Now, ma\\'am, do you or do you not think that your danger and\\nunhappiness would seriously affect his balance, his control over his\\nactions?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  His reason, even?\\n\\nRUTH.  For a moment like, I think it would.\\n\\nFROME.  Was he very much upset that Friday morning, or was he fairly\\ncalm?\\n\\nRUTH.  Dreadfully upset.  I could hardly bear to let him go from me.\\n\\nFROME.  Do you still love him?\\n\\nRUTH.  [With her eyes on FALDER]  He\\'s ruined himself for me.\\n\\nFROME.  Thank you.\\n\\n     He sits down.  RUTH remains stoically upright in the witness-box.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  [In a considerate voice]  When you left him on the morning\\nof Friday the 7th you would not say that he was out of his mind, I\\nsuppose?\\n\\nRUTH.  No, sir.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Thank you; I\\'ve no further questions to ask you.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Bending a little forward to the jury]  I would have done the\\nsame for him; I would indeed.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Please, please!  You say your married life is an unhappy\\none?  Faults on both sides?\\n\\nRUTH.  Only that I never bowed down to him.  I don\\'t see why I\\nshould, sir, not to a man like that.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  You refused to obey him?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Avoiding the question]  I\\'ve always studied him to keep\\nthings nice.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Until you met the prisoner--was that it?\\n\\nRUTH.  No; even after that.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  I ask, you know, because you seem to me to glory in this\\naffection of yours for the prisoner.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Hesitating]  I--I do.  It\\'s the only thing in my life now.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Staring at her hard] Well, step down, please.\\n\\n     RUTH looks at FALDER, then passes quietly down and takes her\\n     seat among the witnesses.\\n\\nFROME.  I call the prisoner, my lord.\\n\\n     FALDER leaves the dock; goes into the witness-box, and is duly\\n     sworn.\\n\\nFROME.  What is your name?\\n\\nFALDER.  William Falder.\\n\\nFROME.  And age?\\n\\nFALDER.  Twenty-three.\\n\\nFROME.  You are not married?\\n\\n     FALDER shakes his head\\n\\nFROME.  How long have you known the last witness?\\n\\nFALDER.  Six months.\\n\\nFROME.  Is her account of the relationship between you a correct one?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes.\\n\\nFROME.  You became devotedly attached to her, however?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Though you knew she was a married woman?\\n\\nFALDER.  I couldn\\'t help it, your lordship.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Couldn\\'t help it?\\n\\nFALDER.  I didn\\'t seem able to.\\n\\n     The JUDGE slightly shrugs his shoulders.\\n\\nFROME.  How did you come to know her?\\n\\nFALDER.  Through my married sister.\\n\\nFROME.  Did you know whether she was happy with her husband?\\n\\nFALDER.  It was trouble all the time.\\n\\nFROME.  You knew her husband?\\n\\nFALDER.  Only through her--he\\'s a brute.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  I can\\'t allow indiscriminate abuse of a person not\\npresent.\\n\\nFROME.  [Bowing]  If your lordship pleases.  [To FALDER]  You admit\\naltering this cheque?\\n\\nFALDER bows his head.\\n\\nFROME.  Carry your mind, please, to the morning of Friday, July the\\n7th, and tell the jury what happened.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Turning to the jury]  I was having my breakfast when she\\ncame.  Her dress was all torn, and she was gasping and couldn\\'t seem\\nto get her breath at all; there were the marks of his fingers round\\nher throat; her arm was bruised, and the blood had got into her eyes\\ndreadfully.  It frightened me, and then when she told me, I felt--I\\nfelt--well--it was too much for me!  [Hardening suddenly]  If you\\'d\\nseen it, having the feelings for her that I had, you\\'d have felt the\\nsame, I know.\\n\\nFROME.  Yes?\\n\\nFALDER.  When she left me--because I had to go to the office--I was\\nout of my senses for fear that he\\'d do it again, and thinking what I\\ncould do.  I couldn\\'t work--all the morning I was like that--simply\\ncouldn\\'t fix my mind on anything.  I couldn\\'t think at all.  I seemed\\nto have to keep moving.  When Davis--the other clerk--gave me the\\ncheque--he said: \"It\\'ll do you good, Will, to have a run with this.\\nYou seem half off your chump this morning.\"  Then when I had it in my\\nhand--I don\\'t know how it came, but it just flashed across me that if\\nI put the \\'ty\\' and the nought there would be the money to get her\\naway.  It just came and went--I never thought of it again.  Then\\nDavis went out to his luncheon, and I don\\'t really remember what I\\ndid till I\\'d pushed the cheque through to the cashier under the rail.\\nI remember his saying \"Gold or notes?\"  Then I suppose I knew what\\nI\\'d done.  Anyway, when I got outside I wanted to chuck myself under\\na bus; I wanted to throw the money away; but it seemed I was in for\\nit, so I thought at any rate I\\'d save her.  Of course the tickets I\\ntook for the passage and the little I gave her\\'s been wasted, and\\nall, except what I was obliged to spend myself, I\\'ve restored.  I\\nkeep thinking over and over however it was I came to do it, and how I\\ncan\\'t have it all again to do differently!\\n\\n     FALDER is silent, twisting his hands before him.\\n\\nFROME.  How far is it from your office to the bank?\\n\\nFALDER.  Not more than fifty yards, sir.\\n\\nFROME.  From the time Davis went out to lunch to the time you cashed\\nthe cheque, how long do you say it must have been?\\n\\nFALDER.  It couldn\\'t have been four minutes, sir, because I ran all\\nthe way.\\n\\nFROME.  During those four minutes you say you remember nothing?\\n\\nFALDER.  No, sir; only that I ran.\\n\\nFROME.  Not even adding the \\'ty\\' and the nought?\\'\\n\\nFALDER.  No, sir.  I don\\'t really.\\n\\n     FROME sits down, and CLEAVER rises.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  But you remember running, do you?\\n\\nFALDER.  I was all out of breath when I got to the bank.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  And you don\\'t remember altering the cheque?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  No, sir.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Divested of the romantic glamour which my friend is casting\\nover the case, is this anything but an ordinary forgery?  Come.\\n\\nFALDER.  I was half frantic all that morning, sir.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Now, now!  You don\\'t deny that the \\'ty\\' and the nought were\\nso like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the\\ncashier?\\n\\nFALDER.  It was an accident.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  [Cheerfully]  Queer sort of accident, wasn\\'t it?  On which\\nday did you alter the counterfoil?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Hanging his head]  On the Wednesday morning.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Was that an accident too?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  No.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  To do that you had to watch your opportunity, I suppose?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Almost inaudibly] Yes.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  You don\\'t suggest that you were suffering under great\\nexcitement when you did that?\\n\\nFALDER.  I was haunted.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  With the fear of being found out?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Very low] Yes.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Didn\\'t it occur to you that the only thing for you to do\\nwas to confess to your employers, and restore the money?\\n\\nFALDER.  I was afraid. [There is silence]\\n\\nCLEAVER.  You desired, too, no doubt, to complete your design of\\ntaking this woman away?\\n\\nFALDER.  When I found I\\'d done a thing like that, to do it for\\nnothing seemed so dreadful.  I might just as well have chucked myself\\ninto the river.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  You knew that the clerk Davis was about to leave England\\n--didn\\'t it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion\\nwould fall on him?\\n\\nFALDER.  It was all done in a moment.  I thought of it afterwards.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  And that didn\\'t lead you to avow what you\\'d done?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Sullenly]  I meant to write when I got out there--I would\\nhave repaid the money.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  But in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have\\nbeen prosecuted.\\n\\nFALDER.  I knew he was a long way off, your lordship.  I thought\\nthere\\'d be time.  I didn\\'t think they\\'d find it out so soon.\\n\\nFROME.  I might remind your lordship that as Mr. Walter How had the\\ncheque-book in his pocket till after Davis had sailed, if the\\ndiscovery had been made only one day later Falder himself would have\\nleft, and suspicion would have attached to him, and not to Davis,\\nfrom the beginning.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  The question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion\\nwould light on himself, and not on Davis.  [To FALDER sharply] Did\\nyou know that Mr. Walter How had the cheque-book till after Davis\\nhad sailed?\\n\\nFALDER.  I--I--thought--he----\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Now speak the truth-yes or no!\\n\\nFALDER.  [Very low]  No, my lord.  I had no means of knowing.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  That disposes of your point, Mr. Frome.\\n\\n     [FROME bows to the JUDGE]\\n\\nCLEAVER.  Has any aberration of this nature ever attacked you before?\\n\\nFALDER.  [Faintly]  No, sir.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  You had recovered sufficiently to go back to your work that\\nafternoon?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, I had to take the money back.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  You mean the nine pounds.  Your wits were sufficiently keen\\nfor you to remember that?  And you still persist in saying you don\\'t\\nremember altering this cheque.  [He sits down]\\n\\nFALDER.  If I hadn\\'t been mad I should never have had the courage.\\n\\nFROME.  [Rising]  Did you have your lunch before going back?\\n\\nFALDER.  I never ate a thing all day; and at night I couldn\\'t sleep.\\n\\nFROME.  Now, as to the four minutes that elapsed between Davis\\'s\\ngoing out and your cashing the cheque: do you say that you recollect\\nnothing during those four minutes?\\n\\nFALDER.  [After a moment] I remember thinking of Mr. Cokeson\\'s face.\\n\\nFROME.  Of Mr. Cokeson\\'s face!  Had that any connection with what you\\nwere doing?\\n\\nFALDER.  No, Sir.\\n\\nFROME.  Was that in the office, before you ran out?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, and while I was running.\\n\\nFROME.  And that lasted till the cashier said: \"Will you have gold or\\nnotes?\"\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, and then I seemed to come to myself--and it was too\\nlate.\\n\\nFROME.  Thank you.  That closes the evidence for the defence, my\\nlord.\\n\\n     The JUDGE nods, and FALDER goes back to his seat in the dock.\\n\\nFROME.  [Gathering up notes]  If it please your lordship--Gentlemen\\nof the Jury,--My friend in cross-examination has shown a disposition\\nto sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case, and I am\\nfree to admit that nothing I can say will move you, if the evidence\\nhas not already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in\\na moment when to all practical intents and purposes he was not\\nresponsible for his actions; a moment of such mental and moral\\nvacuity, arising from the violent emotional agitation under which he\\nhad been suffering, as to amount to temporary madness.  My friend has\\nalluded to the \"romantic glamour\" with which I have sought to invest\\nthis case.  Gentlemen, I have done nothing of the kind.  I have\\nmerely shown you the background of \"life\"--that palpitating life\\nwhich, believe me--whatever my friend may say--always lies behind the\\ncommission of a crime.  Now gentlemen, we live in a highly, civilized\\nage, and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very strange\\nway, even when we have no personal interest in the matter.  But when\\nwe see it inflicted on a woman whom we love--what then?  Just think\\nof what your own feelings would have been, each of you, at the\\nprisoner\\'s age; and then look at him.  Well!  he is hardly the\\ncomfortable, shall we say bucolic, person likely to contemplate with\\nequanimity marks of gross violence on a woman to whom he was\\ndevotedly attached.  Yes, gentlemen, look at him!  He has not a\\nstrong face; but neither has he a vicious face.  He is just the sort\\nof man who would easily become the prey of his emotions.  You have\\nheard the description of his eyes.  My friend may laugh at the word\\n\"funny\"--I think it better describes the peculiar uncanny look of\\nthose who are strained to breaking-point than any other word which\\ncould have been used.  I don\\'t pretend, mind you, that his mental\\nirresponsibility--was more than a flash of darkness, in which all\\nsense of proportion became lost; but to contend, that, just as a man\\nwho destroys himself at such a moment may be, and often is, absolved\\nfrom the stigma attaching to the crime of self-murder, so he may, and\\nfrequently does, commit other crimes while in this irresponsible\\ncondition, and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent\\nand treated as a patient.  I admit that this is a plea which might\\nwell be abused.  It is a matter for discretion.  But here you have a\\ncase in which there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt.\\nYou heard me ask the prisoner what he thought of during those four\\nfatal minutes.  What was his answer?  \"I thought of Mr. Cokeson\\'s\\nface!\"  Gentlemen, no man could invent an answer like that; it is\\nabsolutely stamped with truth.  You have seen the great affection\\n[legitimate or not] existing between him and this woman, who came\\nhere to give evidence for him at the risk of her life.  It is\\nimpossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he\\ncommitted this act.  We well know what terrible havoc such distress\\ncan make in weak and highly nervous people.  It was all the work of a\\nmoment.  The rest has followed, as death follows a stab to the heart,\\nor water drops if you hold up a jug to empty it.  Believe me,\\ngentlemen, there is nothing more tragic in life than the utter\\nimpossibility of changing what you have done.  Once this cheque was\\naltered and presented, the work of four minutes--four mad minutes\\n--the rest has been silence.  But in those four minutes the boy\\nbefore you has slipped through a door, hardly opened, into that great\\ncage which never again quite lets a man go--the cage of the Law.  His\\nfurther acts, his failure to confess, the alteration of the\\ncounterfoil, his preparations for flight, are all evidence--not of\\ndeliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from\\nwhich these subsequent acts arose; no--they are merely evidence of\\nthe weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune.  But is a\\nman to be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character?\\nGentlemen, men like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law\\nfor want of that human insight which sees them as they are, patients,\\nand not criminals.  If the prisoner be found guilty, and treated as\\nthough he were a criminal type, he will, as all experience shows, in\\nall probability become one.  I beg you not to return a verdict that\\nmay thrust him back into prison and brand him for ever.  Gentlemen,\\nJustice is a machine that, when some one has once given it the\\nstarting push, rolls on of itself.  Is this young man to be ground to\\npieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one of\\nweakness?  Is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man\\nthose dark, ill-starred ships called prisons?  Is that to be his\\nvoyage-from which so few return?  Or is he to have another chance, to\\nbe still looked on as one who has gone a little astray, but who will\\ncome back?  I urge you, gentlemen, do not ruin this young man!  For,\\nas a result of those four minutes, ruin, utter and irretrievable,\\nstares him in the face.  He can be saved now.  Imprison him as a\\ncriminal, and I affirm to you that he will be lost.  He has neither\\nthe face nor the manner of one who can survive that terrible ordeal.\\nWeigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he has\\nundergone.  The latter is ten times heavier already.  He has lain in\\nprison under this charge for more than two months.  Is he likely ever\\nto forget that?  Imagine the anguish of his mind during that time.\\nHe has had his punishment, gentlemen, you may depend.  The rolling of\\nthe chariot-wheels of Justice over this boy began when it was decided\\nto prosecute him.  We are now already at the second stage.  If you\\npermit it to go on to the third I would not give--that for him.\\n\\n     He holds up finger and thumb in the form of a circle, drops his\\n     hand, and sits dozen.\\n\\nThe jury stir, and consult each other\\'s faces; then they turn towards\\nthe counsel for the Crown, who rises, and, fixing his eyes on a spot\\nthat seems to give him satisfaction, slides them every now and then\\ntowards the jury.\\n\\nCLEAVER.  May it please your lordship--[Rising on his toes] Gentlemen\\nof the Jury,--The facts in this case are not disputed, and the\\ndefence, if my friend will allow me to say so, is so thin that I\\ndon\\'t propose to waste the time of the Court by taking you over the\\nevidence.  The plea is one of temporary insanity.  Well, gentlemen, I\\ndaresay it is clearer to me than it is to you why this rather--what\\nshall we call it?--bizarre defence has been set up.  The alternative\\nwould have been to plead guilty.  Now, gentlemen, if the prisoner had\\npleaded guilty my friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to\\nhis lordship.  Instead of that, he has gone into the byways and\\nhedges and found this--er--peculiar plea, which has enabled him to\\nshow you the proverbial woman, to put her in the box--to give, in\\nfact, a romantic glow to this affair.  I compliment my friend; I\\nthink it highly ingenious of him.  By these means, he has--to a\\ncertain extent--got round the Law.  He has brought the whole story of\\nmotive and stress out in court, at first hand, in a way that he would\\nnot otherwise have been able to do.  But when you have once grasped\\nthat fact, gentlemen, you have grasped everything.  [With\\ngood-humoured contempt]  For look at this plea of insanity; we can\\'t\\nput it lower than that.  You have heard the woman.  She has every\\nreason to favour the prisoner, but what did she say?  She said that\\nthe prisoner was not insane when she left him in the morning.  If he\\nwere going out of his mind through distress, that was obviously the\\nmoment when insanity would have shown itself.  You have heard the\\nmanaging clerk, another witness for the defence.  With some\\ndifficulty I elicited from him the admission that the prisoner,\\nthough jumpy [a word that he seemed to think you would understand,\\ngentlemen, and I\\'m sure I hope you do], was not mad when the cheque\\nwas handed to Davis.  I agree with my friend that it\\'s unfortunate\\nthat we have not got Davis here, but the prisoner has told you the\\nwords with which Davis in turn handed him the cheque; he obviously,\\ntherefore, was not mad when he received it, or he would not have\\nremembered those words.  The cashier has told you that he was\\ncertainly in his senses when he cashed it.  We have therefore the\\nplea that a man who is sane at ten minutes past one, and sane at\\nfifteen minutes past, may, for the purposes of avoiding the\\nconsequences of a crime, call himself insane between those points of\\ntime.  Really, gentlemen, this is so peculiar a proposition that I am\\nnot disposed to weary you with further argument.  You will form your\\nown opinion of its value.  My friend has adopted this way of saying a\\ngreat deal to you--and very eloquently--on the score of youth,\\ntemptation, and the like.  I might point out, however, that the\\noffence with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious\\nknown to our law; and there are certain features in this case, such\\nas the suspicion which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellow-clerk,\\nand his relations with this married woman, which will render it\\ndifficult for you to attach too much importance to such pleading. I\\nask you, in short, gentlemen, for that verdict of guilty which, in the\\ncircumstances, I regard you as, unfortunately, bound to record.\\n\\n     Letting his eyes travel from the JUDGE and the jury to FROME, he\\n     sits down.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Bending a little towards the jury, and speaking in a\\nbusiness-like voice]  Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence, and the\\ncomments on it.  My only business is to make clear to you the issues\\nyou have to try.  The facts are admitted, so far as the alteration of\\nthis cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner.  The defence set up is\\nthat he was not in a responsible condition when he committed the\\ncrime.  Well, you have heard the prisoner\\'s story, and the evidence\\nof the other witnesses--so far as it bears on the point of insanity.\\nIf you think that what you have heard establishes the fact that the\\nprisoner was insane at the time of the forgery, you will find him\\nguilty, but insane.  If, on the other hand, you conclude from what\\nyou have seen and heard that the prisoner was sane--and nothing short\\nof insanity will count--you will find him guilty.  In reviewing the\\ntestimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind very\\ncarefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before\\nand after the act of forgery--the evidence of the prisoner himself,\\nof the woman, of the witness--er--COKESON, and--er--of the cashier.\\nAnd in regard to that I especially direct your attention to the\\nprisoner\\'s admission that the idea of adding the \\'ty\\' and the nought\\ndid come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to\\nhim; and also to the alteration of the counterfoil, and to his\\nsubsequent conduct generally.  The bearing of all this on the\\nquestion of premeditation [and premeditation will imply sanity] is\\nvery obvious.  You must not allow any considerations of age or\\ntemptation to weigh with you in the finding of your verdict.  Before\\nyou can come to a verdict of guilty but insane you must be well and\\nthoroughly convinced that the condition of his mind was such as would\\nhave qualified him at the moment for a lunatic asylum.  [He pauses,\\nthen, seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to retire or no,\\nadds:] You may retire, gentlemen, if you wish to do so.\\n\\n     The jury retire by a door behind the JUDGE.  The JUDGE bends\\n     over his notes.  FALDER, leaning from the dock, speaks excitedly\\n     to his solicitor, pointing dawn at RUTH.  The solicitor in turn\\n     speaks to FROME.\\n\\nFROME.  [Rising] My lord.  The prisoner is very anxious that I should\\nask you if your lordship would kindly request the reporters not to\\ndisclose the name of the woman witness in the Press reports of these\\nproceedings.  Your lordship will understand that the consequences\\nmight be extremely serious to her.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Pointedly--with the suspicion of a smile]  well, Mr.\\nFrome, you deliberately took this course which involved bringing her\\nhere.\\n\\nFROME. [With an ironic bow]  If your lordship thinks I could have\\nbrought out the full facts in any other way?\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  H\\'m!  Well.\\n\\nFROME.  There is very real danger to her, your lordship.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  You see, I have to take your word for all that.\\n\\nFROME.  If your lordship would be so kind.  I can assure your\\nlordship that I am not exaggerating.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  It goes very much against the grain with me that the name\\nof a witness should ever be suppressed.  [With a glance at FALDER,\\nwho is gripping and clasping his hands before him, and then at RUTH,\\nwho is sitting perfectly rigid with her eyes fixed on FALDER]  I\\'ll\\nconsider your application.  It must depend.  I have to remember that\\nshe may have come here to commit perjury on the prisoner\\'s behalf.\\n\\nFROME.  Your lordship, I really----\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  Yes, yes--I don\\'t suggest anything of the sort, Mr.\\nFrome.  Leave it at that for the moment.\\n\\n     As he finishes speaking, the jury return, and file back into the\\n     box.\\n\\nCLERK of ASSIZE.  Gentlemen, are you agreed on your verdict?\\n\\nFOREMAN.  We are.\\n\\nCLERK of ASSIZE.  Is it Guilty, or Guilty but insane?\\n\\nFOREMAN.  Guilty.\\n\\n     The JUDGE nods; then, gathering up his notes, sits looking at\\n     FALDER, who stands motionless.\\n\\nFROME.  [Rising] If your lordship would allow me to address you in\\nmitigation of sentence.  I don\\'t know if your lordship thinks I can\\nadd anything to what I have said to the jury on the score of the\\nprisoner\\'s youth, and the great stress under which he acted.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  I don\\'t think you can, Mr. Frome.\\n\\nFROME.  If your lordship says so--I do most earnestly beg your\\nlordship to give the utmost weight to my plea.  [He sits down.]\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [To the CLERK] Call upon him.\\n\\nTHE CLERK.  Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted of felony.  Have\\nyou anything to say for yourself, why the Court should not give you\\njudgment according to law?  [FALDER shakes his head]\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  William Falder, you have been given fair trial and found\\nguilty, in my opinion rightly found guilty, of forgery.  [He pauses;\\nthen, consulting his notes, goes on]  The defence was set up that you\\nwere not responsible for your actions at the moment of committing\\nthis crime.  There is no, doubt, I think, that this was a device to\\nbring out at first hand the nature of the temptation to which you\\nsuccumbed.  For throughout the trial your counsel was in reality\\nmaking an appeal for mercy.  The setting up of this defence of course\\nenabled him to put in some evidence that might weigh in that\\ndirection.  Whether he was well advised to so is another matter.  He\\nclaimed that you should be treated rather as a patient than as a\\ncriminal.  And this plea of his, which in the end amounted to a\\npassionate appeal, he based in effect on an indictment of the march\\nof Justice, which he practically accused of confirming and completing\\nthe process of criminality.  Now, in considering how far I should\\nallow weight to his appeal; I have a number of factors to take into\\naccount.  I have to consider on the one hand the grave nature of your\\noffence, the deliberate way in which you subsequently altered the\\ncounterfoil, the danger you caused to an innocent man--and that, to\\nmy mind, is a very grave point--and finally I have to consider the\\nnecessity of deterring others from following your example.  On the\\nother hand, I have to bear in mind that you are young, that you have\\nhitherto borne a good character, that you were, if I am to believe\\nyour evidence and that of your witnesses, in a state of some\\nemotional excitement when you committed this crime.  I have every\\nwish, consistently with my duty--not only to you, but to the\\ncommunity--to treat you with leniency.  And this brings me to what\\nare the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your\\ncase.  You are a clerk in a lawyer\\'s office--that is a very serious\\nelement in this case; there can be no possible excuse made for you on\\nthe ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the\\ncrime you were committing, and the penalties that attach to it.  It\\nis said, however, that you were carried away by your emotions.  The\\nstory has been told here to-day of your relations with this--er--Mrs.\\nHoneywill; on that story both the defence and the plea for mercy were\\nin effect based.  Now what is that story?  It is that you, a young\\nman, and she, a young woman, unhappily married, had formed an\\nattachment, which you both say--with what truth I am unable to gauge\\n--had not yet resulted in immoral relations, but which you both admit\\nwas about to result in such relationship.  Your counsel has made an\\nattempt to palliate this, on the ground that the woman is in what he\\ndescribes, I think, as \"a hopeless position.\"  As to that I can\\nexpress no opinion.  She is a married woman, and the fact is patent\\nthat you committed this crime with the view of furthering an immoral\\ndesign.  Now, however I might wish, I am not able to justify to my\\nconscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to morality.\\nIt is vitiated \\'ab initio\\', and would, if successful, free you for\\nthe completion of this immoral project.  Your counsel has made an\\nattempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a\\ndefect in the marriage law; he has made an attempt also to show that\\nto punish you with further imprisonment would be unjust.  I do not\\nfollow him in these flights.  The Law is what it is--a majestic\\nedifice, sheltering all of us, each stone of which rests on another.\\nI am concerned only with its administration.  The crime you have\\ncommitted is a very serious one.  I cannot feel it in accordance with\\nmy duty to Society to exercise the powers I have in your favour.  You\\nwill go to penal servitude for three years.\\n\\n     FALDER, who throughout the JUDGE\\'S speech has looked at him\\n     steadily, lets his head fall forward on his breast.  RUTH starts\\n     up from her seat as he is taken out by the warders.  There is a\\n     bustle in court.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  [Speaking to the reporters] Gentlemen of the Press, I\\nthink that the name of the female witness should not be reported.\\n\\n     The reporters bow their acquiescence.  THE JUDGE.  [To RUTH, who\\n     is staring in the direction in which FALDER has disappeared] Do\\n     you understand, your name will not be mentioned?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Pulling her sleeve]  The judge is speaking to you.\\n\\n     RUTH turns, stares at the JUDGE, and turns away.\\n\\nTHE JUDGE.  I shall sit rather late to-day.  Call the next case.\\n\\nCLERK of ASSIZE.  [To a warder]  Put up John Booley.\\n\\n     To cries of \"Witnesses in the case of Booley\":\\n\\n\\n                    The curtain falls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT III\\n\\nSCENE I\\n\\n     A prison.  A plainly furnished room, with two large barred\\n     windows, overlooking the prisoners\\' exercise yard, where men, in\\n     yellow clothes marked with arrows, and yellow brimless caps, are\\n     seen in single file at a distance of four yards from each other,\\n     walking rapidly on serpentine white lines marked on the concrete\\n     floor of the yard.  Two warders in blue uniforms, with peaked\\n     caps and swords, are stationed amongst them.  The room has\\n     distempered walls, a bookcase with numerous official-looking\\n     books, a cupboard between the windows, a plan of the prison on\\n     the wall, a writing-table covered with documents.  It is\\n     Christmas Eve.\\n\\n     The GOVERNOR, a neat, grave-looking man, with a trim, fair\\n     moustache, the eyes of a theorist, and grizzled hair, receding\\n     from the temples, is standing close to this writing-table\\n     looking at a sort of rough saw made out of a piece of metal.\\n     The hand in which he holds it is gloved, for two fingers\\n     are missing.  The chief warder, WOODER, a tall, thin,\\n     military-looking man of sixty, with grey moustache and\\n     melancholy, monkey-like eyes, stands very upright two paces\\n     from him.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With a faint, abstracted smile]  Queer-looking\\naffair, Mr. Wooder!  Where did you find it?\\n\\nWOODER.  In his mattress, sir.  Haven\\'t come across such a thing for\\ntwo years now.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With curiosity] Had he any set plan?\\n\\nWOODER.  He\\'d sawed his window-bar about that much.  [He holds up his\\nthumb and finger a quarter of an inch apart]\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I\\'ll see him this afternoon.  What\\'s his name?\\nMoaney!  An old hand, I think?\\n\\nWOODER.  Yes, sir-fourth spell of penal.  You\\'d think an old lag like\\nhim would have had more sense by now.  [With pitying contempt]\\nOccupied his mind, he said.  Breaking in and breaking out--that\\'s all\\nthey think about.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Who\\'s next him?\\n\\nWOODER.  O\\'Cleary, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  The Irishman.\\n\\nWOODER.  Next him again there\\'s that young fellow, Falder--star\\nclass--and next him old Clipton.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Ah, yes!  \"The philosopher.\"  I want to see him about\\nhis eyes.\\n\\nWOODER.  Curious thing, sir: they seem to know when there\\'s one of\\nthese tries at escape going on.  It makes them restive--there\\'s a\\nregular wave going through them just now.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Meditatively]  Odd things--those waves.  [Turning to\\nlook at the prisoners exercising]  Seem quiet enough out here!\\n\\nWOODER.  That Irishman, O\\'Cleary, began banging on his door this\\nmorning.  Little thing like that\\'s quite enough to upset the whole\\nlot.  They\\'re just like dumb animals at times.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I\\'ve seen it with horses before thunder--it\\'ll run\\nright through cavalry lines.\\n\\n     The prison CHAPLAIN has entered.  He is a dark-haired, ascetic\\n     man, in clerical undress, with a peculiarly steady, tight-lipped\\n     face and slow, cultured speech.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Holding up the saw]  Seen this, Miller?\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Useful-looking specimen.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Do for the Museum, eh!  [He goes to the cupboard and\\nopens it, displaying to view a number of quaint ropes, hooks, and\\nmetal tools with labels tied on them]  That\\'ll do, thanks, Mr.\\nWooder.\\n\\nWOODER.  [Saluting]  Thank you, sir.  [He goes out]\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Account for the state of the men last day or two,\\nMiller?  Seems going through the whole place.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  No.  I don\\'t know of anything.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  By the way, will you dine with us on Christmas Day?\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  To-morrow.  Thanks very much.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Worries me to feel the men discontented.  [Gazing at\\nthe saw]  Have to punish this poor devil.  Can\\'t help liking a man\\nwho tries to escape.  [He places the saw in his pocket and locks the\\ncupboard again]\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Extraordinary perverted will-power--some of them.\\nNothing to be done till it\\'s broken.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  And not much afterwards, I\\'m afraid.  Ground too hard\\nfor golf?\\n\\n     WOODER comes in again.\\n\\nWOODER.  Visitor who\\'s been seeing Q 3007 asks to speak to you, sir.\\nI told him it wasn\\'t usual.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  What about?\\n\\nWOODER.  Shall I put him off, sir?\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Resignedly]  No, no.  Let\\'s see him.  Don\\'t go,\\nMiller.\\n\\nWOODER motions to some one without, and as the visitor comes in\\nwithdraws.\\n\\n     The visitor is COKESON, who is attired in a thick overcoat to\\n     the knees, woollen gloves, and carries a top hat.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m sorry to trouble you.  I\\'ve been talking to the young\\nman.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  We have a good many here.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Name of Falder, forgery.  [Producing a card, and handing it\\nto the GOVERNOR]  Firm of James and Walter How.  Well known in the\\nlaw.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Receiving the card-with a faint smile]  What do you\\nwant to see me about, sir?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise]  Why! what a\\nsight!\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Yes, we have that privilege from here; my office is\\nbeing done up.  [Sitting down at his table]  Now, please!\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window] I\\nwanted to say a word to you; I shan\\'t keep you long.\\n[Confidentially]  Fact is, I oughtn\\'t to be here by rights.  His\\nsister came to me--he\\'s got no father and mother--and she was in some\\ndistress.  \"My husband won\\'t let me go and see him,\" she said; \"says\\nhe\\'s disgraced the family.  And his other sister,\" she said, \"is an\\ninvalid.\"  And she asked me to come.  Well, I take an interest in\\nhim.  He was our junior--I go to the same chapel--and I didn\\'t like\\nto refuse.  And what I wanted to tell you was, he seems lonely here.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Not unnaturally.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m afraid it\\'ll prey on my mind.  I see a lot of them\\nabout working together.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Those are local prisoners.  The convicts serve their\\nthree months here in separate confinement, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  But we don\\'t want to be unreasonable.  He\\'s quite\\ndownhearted.  I wanted to ask you to let him run about with the\\nothers.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With faint amusement]  Ring the bell-would you,\\nMiller?  [To COKESON]  You\\'d like to hear what the doctor says about\\nhim, perhaps.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [Ringing the bell]  You are not accustomed to prisons,\\nit would seem, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  No.  But it\\'s a pitiful sight.  He\\'s quite a young fellow.\\nI said to him: \"Before a month\\'s up\" I said, \"you\\'ll be out and about\\nwith the others; it\\'ll be a nice change for you.\"  \"A month!\" he said\\n--like that!  \"Come!\" I said, \"we mustn\\'t exaggerate.  What\\'s a\\nmonth?  Why, it\\'s nothing!\"  \"A day,\" he said, \"shut up in your cell\\nthinking and brooding as I do, it\\'s longer than a year outside.  I\\ncan\\'t help it,\" he said; \"I try--but I\\'m built that way, Mr.\\nCOKESON.\"  And, he held his hand up to his face.  I could see the\\ntears trickling through his fingers.  It wasn\\'t nice.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  He\\'s a young man with large, rather peculiar eyes,\\nisn\\'t he?  Not Church of England, I think?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  I know.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [To WOODER, who has come in]  Ask the doctor to be\\ngood enough to come here for a minute.  [WOODER salutes, and goes\\nout]  Let\\'s see, he\\'s not married?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No.  [Confidentially]  But there\\'s a party he\\'s very much\\nattached to, not altogether com-il-fa.  It\\'s a sad story.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  If it wasn\\'t for drink and women, sir, this prison\\nmight be closed.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking at the CHAPLAIN over his spectacles] Ye-es, but I\\nwanted to tell you about that, special.  He had hopes they\\'d have let\\nher come and see him, but they haven\\'t.  Of course he asked me\\nquestions.  I did my best, but I couldn\\'t tell the poor young fellow\\na lie, with him in here--seemed like hitting him.  But I\\'m afraid\\nit\\'s made him worse.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  What was this news then?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Like this.  The woman had a nahsty, spiteful feller for a\\nhusband, and she\\'d left him.  Fact is, she was going away with our\\nyoung friend.  It\\'s not nice--but I\\'ve looked over it.  Well, when he\\nwas put in here she said she\\'d earn her living apart, and wait for\\nhim to come out.  That was a great consolation to him.  But after a\\nmonth she came to me--I don\\'t know her personally--and she said:\\n\"I can\\'t earn the children\\'s living, let alone my own--I\\'ve got no\\nfriends.  I\\'m obliged to keep out of everybody\\'s way, else my\\nhusband\\'d get to know where I was.  I\\'m very much reduced,\" she said.\\nAnd she has lost flesh.  \"I\\'ll have to go in the workhouse!\" It\\'s a\\npainful story.  I said to her: \"No,\" I said, \"not that!  I\\'ve got a\\nwife an\\' family, but sooner than you should do that I\\'ll spare you a\\nlittle myself.\"  \"Really,\" she said--she\\'s a nice creature--\"I don\\'t\\nlike to take it from you.  I think I\\'d better go back to my husband.\"\\nWell, I know he\\'s a nahsty, spiteful feller--drinks--but I didn\\'t\\nlike to persuade her not to.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Surely, no.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es, but I\\'m sorry now; it\\'s upset the poor young fellow\\ndreadfully.  And what I wanted to say was: He\\'s got his three years\\nto serve.  I want things to be pleasant for him.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [With a touch of impatience] The Law hardly shares\\nyour view, I\\'m afraid.\\n\\nCOKESON.  But I can\\'t help thinking that to shut him up there by\\nhimself\\'ll turn him silly.  And nobody wants that, I s\\'pose.  I don\\'t\\nlike to see a man cry.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  It\\'s a very rare thing for them to give way like that.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Looking at him-in a tone of sudden dogged hostility]\\nI keep dogs.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Indeed?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye-es.  And I say this: I wouldn\\'t shut one of them up all\\nby himself, month after month, not if he\\'d bit me all over.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Unfortunately, the criminal is not a dog; he has a\\nsense of right and wrong.\\n\\nCOKESON.  But that\\'s not the way to make him feel it.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Ah!  there I\\'m afraid we must differ.\\n\\nCOKESON.  It\\'s the same with dogs.  If you treat \\'em with kindness\\nthey\\'ll do anything for you; but to shut \\'em up alone, it only makes\\n\\'em savage.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Surely you should allow those who have had a little\\nmore experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Doggedly]  I know this young feller, I\\'ve watched him for\\nyears.  He\\'s eurotic--got no stamina.  His father died of\\nconsumption.  I\\'m thinking of his future.  If he\\'s to be kept there\\nshut up by himself, without a cat to keep him company, it\\'ll do him\\nharm.  I said to him: \"Where do you feel it?\"  \"I can\\'t tell you, Mr.\\nCOKESON,\" he said, \"but sometimes I could beat my head against the\\nwall.\"  It\\'s not nice.\\n\\n     During this speech the DOCTOR has entered.  He is a\\n     medium-Sized, rather good-looking man, with a quick eye.\\n     He stands leaning against the window.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  This gentleman thinks the separate is telling on\\nQ 3007--Falder, young thin fellow, star class.  What do you say,\\nDoctor Clements?\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  He doesn\\'t like it, but it\\'s not doing him any harm.\\n\\nCOKESON.  But he\\'s told me.\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  Of course he\\'d say so, but we can always tell.  He\\'s\\nlost no weight since he\\'s been here.\\n\\nCOKESON.  It\\'s his state of mind I\\'m speaking of.\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  His mind\\'s all right so far.  He\\'s nervous, rather\\nmelancholy.  I don\\'t see signs of anything more.  I\\'m watching him\\ncarefully.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Nonplussed]  I\\'m glad to hear you say that.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [More suavely] It\\'s just at this period that we are\\nable to make some impression on them, sir.  I am speaking from my\\nspecial standpoint.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Turning bewildered to the GOVERNOR] I don\\'t want to be\\nunpleasant, but having given him this news, I do feel it\\'s awkward.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I\\'ll make a point of seeing him to-day.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m much obliged to you.  I thought perhaps seeing him\\nevery day you wouldn\\'t notice it.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Rather sharply]  If any sign of injury to his health\\nshows itself his case will be reported at once.  That\\'s fully\\nprovided for.  [He rises]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Following his own thoughts]  Of course, what you don\\'t see\\ndoesn\\'t trouble you; but having seen him, I don\\'t want to have him on\\nmy mind.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I think you may safely leave it to us, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Mollified and apologetic]  I thought you\\'d understand me.\\nI\\'m a plain man--never set myself up against authority.  [Expanding\\nto the CHAPLAIN]  Nothing personal meant.  Good-morning.\\n\\n     As he goes out the three officials do not look at each other,\\n     but their faces wear peculiar expressions.\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  Our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Returning suddenly with an apologetic air]  There\\'s just\\none little thing.  This woman--I suppose I mustn\\'t ask you to let him\\nsee her.  It\\'d be a rare treat for them both.  He\\'s thinking about\\nher all the time.  Of course she\\'s not his wife.  But he\\'s quite safe\\nin here.  They\\'re a pitiful couple.  You couldn\\'t make an exception?\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Wearily] As you say, my dear sir, I couldn\\'t make an\\nexception; he won\\'t be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes\\nto a convict prison.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I see.  [Rather coldly] Sorry to have troubled you.\\n[He again goes out]\\n\\nTHE CHAPLAIN.  [Shrugging his shoulders]  The plain man indeed, poor\\nfellow.  Come and have some lunch, Clements?\\n\\n\\n     He and the DOCTOR go out talking.\\n\\n     The GOVERNOR, with a sigh, sits down at his table and takes up a\\n     pen.\\n\\n\\n                         The curtain falls.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE II\\n\\n     Part of the ground corridor of the prison.  The walls are\\n     coloured with greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green\\n     about the height of a man\\'s shoulder, and above this line are\\n     whitewashed.  The floor is of blackened stones.  Daylight is\\n     filtering through a heavily barred window at the end.  The doors\\n     of four cells are visible.  Each cell door has a little round\\n     peep-hole at the level of a man\\'s eye, covered by a little round\\n     disc, which, raised upwards, affords a view o f the cell.  On\\n     the wall, close to each cell door, hangs a little square board\\n     with the prisoner\\'s name, number, and record.\\n\\n     Overhead can be seen the iron structures of the first-floor and\\n     second-floor corridors.\\n\\n     The WARDER INSTRUCTOR, a bearded man in blue uniform, with an\\n     apron, and some dangling keys, is just emerging from one of the\\n     cells.\\n\\nINSTRUCTOR.  [Speaking from the door into the cell]  I\\'ll have\\nanother bit for you when that\\'s finished.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  [Unseen--in an Irish voice] Little doubt o\\' that, sirr.\\n\\nINSTRUCTOR.  [Gossiping]  Well, you\\'d rather have it than nothing, I\\ns\\'pose.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  An\\' that\\'s the blessed truth.\\n\\n     Sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked, and of\\n     approaching footsteps.\\n\\nINSTRUCTOR.  [In a sharp, changed voice]  Look alive over it!\\n\\n     He shuts the cell door, and stands at attention.\\n\\n     The GOVERNOR comes walking down the corridor, followed by\\n     WOODER.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Anything to report?\\n\\nINSTRUCTOR.  [Saluting]  Q 3007  [he points to a cell]  is behind\\nwith his work, sir.  He\\'ll lose marks to-day.\\n\\n     The GOVERNOR nods and passes on to the end cell.  The INSTRUCTOR\\n     goes away.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  This is our maker of saws, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n     He takes the saw from his pocket as WOODER throws open the door\\n     of the cell.  The convict MOANEY is seen lying on his bed,\\n     athwart the cell, with his cap on.  He springs up and stands in\\n     the middle of the cell.  He is a raw-boned fellow, about\\n     fifty-six years old, with outstanding bat\\'s ears and fierce,\\n     staring, steel-coloured eyes.\\n\\nWOODER.  Cap off!  [MOANEY removes his cap] Out here! [MOANEY Comes\\nto the door]\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Beckoning him out into the corridor, and holding up\\nthe saw--with the manner of an officer speaking to a private]\\nAnything to say about this, my man?  [MOANEY is silent]  Come!\\n\\nMOANEY.  It passed the time.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Pointing into the cell]  Not enough to do, eh?\\n\\nMOANEY.  It don\\'t occupy your mind.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Tapping the saw]  You might find a better way than\\nthis.\\n\\nMOANEY.  [Sullenly]  Well!  What way?  I must keep my hand in against\\nthe time I get out.  What\\'s the good of anything else to me at my\\ntime of life?  [With a gradual change to civility, as his tongue\\nwarms]  Ye know that, sir.  I\\'ll be in again within a year or two,\\nafter I\\'ve done this lot.  I don\\'t want to disgrace meself when I\\'m\\nout.  You\\'ve got your pride keeping the prison smart; well, I\\'ve got\\nmine.  [Seeing that the GOVERNOR is listening with interest, he goes\\non, pointing to the saw]  I must be doin\\' a little o\\' this.  It\\'s no\\nharm to any one.  I was five weeks makin\\' that saw--a bit of all\\nright it is, too; now I\\'ll get cells, I suppose, or seven days\\' bread\\nand water.  You can\\'t help it, sir, I know that--I quite put meself\\nin your place.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Now, look here, Moaney, if I pass it over will you\\ngive me your word not to try it on again?  Think!  [He goes into the\\ncell, walks to the end of it, mounts the stool, and tries the\\nwindow-bars]\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Returning]  Well?\\n\\nMOANEY.  [Who has been reflecting] I\\'ve got another six weeks to do\\nin here, alone.  I can\\'t do it and think o\\' nothing.  I must have\\nsomething to interest me.  You\\'ve made me a sporting offer, sir, but\\nI can\\'t pass my word about it.  I shouldn\\'t like to deceive a\\ngentleman.  [Pointing into the cell] Another four hours\\' steady work\\nwould have done it.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Yes, and what then?  Caught, brought back, punishment.\\nFive weeks\\' hard work to make this, and cells at the end of it, while\\nthey put anew bar to your window.  Is it worth it, Moaney?\\n\\nMOANEY.  [With a sort of fierceness] Yes, it is.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Putting his hand to his brow] Oh, well!  Two days\\'\\ncells-bread and water.\\n\\nMOANEY.  Thank \\'e, sir.\\n\\n     He turns quickly like an animal and slips into his cell.\\n\\n     The GOVERNOR looks after him and shakes his head as WOODER\\n     closes and locks the cell door.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Open Clipton\\'s cell.\\n\\n     WOODER opens the door of CLIPTON\\'S cell.   CLIPTON is sitting on\\n     a stool just inside the door, at work on a pair of trousers.  He\\n     is a small, thick, oldish man, with an almost shaven head, and\\n     smouldering little dark eyes behind smoked spectacles.  He gets\\n     up and stands motionless in the doorway, peering at his\\n     visitors.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Beckoning] Come out here a minute, Clipton.\\n\\n     CLIPTON, with a sort of dreadful quietness, comes into the\\n     corridor, the needle and thread in his hand.  The GOVERNOR signs\\n     to WOODER, who goes into the cell and inspects it carefully.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  How are your eyes?\\n\\nCLIFTON.  I don\\'t complain of them.  I don\\'t see the sun here.  [He\\nmakes a stealthy movement, protruding his neck a little]  There\\'s\\njust one thing, Mr. Governor, as you\\'re speaking to me.  I wish you\\'d\\nask the cove next door here to keep a bit quieter.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  What\\'s the matter?  I don\\'t want any tales, Clipton.\\n\\nCLIPTON.  He keeps me awake.  I don\\'t know who he is.  [With\\ncontempt]  One of this star class, I expect.  Oughtn\\'t to be here\\nwith us.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Quietly]  Quite right, Clipton.  He\\'ll be moved when\\nthere\\'s a cell vacant.\\n\\nCLIPTON.  He knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning.\\nI\\'m not used to it--stops me getting my sleep out.  In the evening\\ntoo.  It\\'s not fair, Mr. Governor, as you\\'re speaking to me.\\nSleep\\'s the comfort I\\'ve got here; I\\'m entitled to take it out full.\\n\\n     WOODER comes out of the cell, and instantly, as though\\n     extinguished, CLIPTON moves with stealthy suddenness back into\\n     his cell.\\n\\nWOODER.  All right, sir.\\n\\n     THE GOVERNOR nods.  The door is closed and locked.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Which is the man who banged on his door this morning?\\n\\nWOODER.  [Going towards O\\'CLEARY\\'S cell]  This one, sir; O\\'Cleary.\\n\\n     He lifts the disc and glances through the peephole.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Open.\\n\\n     WOODER throws open the door.  O\\'CLEARY, who is seated at a\\n     little table by the door as if listening, springs up and stands\\n     at attention jest inside the doorway.  He is a broad-faced,\\n     middle-aged man, with a wide, thin, flexible mouth, and little\\n     holes under his high cheek-bones.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Where\\'s the joke, O\\'Cleary?\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  The joke, your honour?  I\\'ve not seen one for a long time.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Banging on your door?\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  Oh! that!\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  It\\'s womanish.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  An\\' it\\'s that I\\'m becoming this two months past.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Anything to complain of?\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  NO, Sirr.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You\\'re an old hand; you ought to know better.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  Yes, I\\'ve been through it all.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You\\'ve got a youngster next door; you\\'ll upset him.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  It cam\\' over me, your honour.  I can\\'t always be the same\\nsteady man.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Work all right?\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  [Taking up a rush mat he is making]  Oh! I can do it on me\\nhead.  It\\'s the miserablest stuff--don\\'t take the brains of a mouse.\\n[Working his mouth]  It\\'s here I feel it--the want of a little noise\\n--a terrible little wud ease me.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You know as well as I do that if you were out in the\\nshops you wouldn\\'t be allowed to talk.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  [With a look of profound meaning]  Not with my mouth.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Well, then?\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  But it\\'s the great conversation I\\'d have.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [With a smile] Well, no more conversation on your\\ndoor.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  No, sirr, I wud not have the little wit to repeat meself.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Turning]  Good-night.\\n\\nO\\'CLEARY.  Good-night, your honour.\\n\\n     He turns into his cell.  The GOVERNOR shuts the door.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Looking at the record card]  Can\\'t help liking the\\npoor blackguard.\\n\\nWOODER.  He\\'s an amiable man, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Pointing down the corridor] Ask the doctor to come\\nhere, Mr. Wooder.\\n\\n     WOODER salutes and goes away down the corridor.\\n\\n     The GOVERNOR goes to the door of FALDER\\'S cell.  He raises his\\n     uninjured hand to uncover the peep-hole; but, without uncovering\\n     it, shakes his head and drops his hand; then, after scrutinising\\n     the record board, he opens the cell door.  FALDER, who is\\n     standing against it, lurches forward.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Beckoning him out]  Now tell me: can\\'t you settle\\ndown, Falder?\\n\\nFALDER.  [In a breathless voice]  Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You know what I mean?  It\\'s no good running your head\\nagainst a stone wall, is it?\\n\\nFALDER.  No, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Well, come.\\n\\nFALDER.  I try, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Can\\'t you sleep?\\n\\nFALDER.  Very little.  Between two o\\'clock and getting up\\'s the worst\\ntime.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  How\\'s that?\\n\\nFALDER.  [His lips twitch with a sort of smile] I don\\'t know, sir.  I\\nwas always nervous.  [Suddenly voluble]  Everything seems to get such\\na size then.  I feel I\\'ll never get out as long as I live.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  That\\'s morbid, my lad.  Pull yourself together.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With an equally sudden dogged resentment] Yes--I\\'ve got to.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Think of all these other fellows?\\n\\nFALDER.  They\\'re used to it.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  They all had to go through it once for the first time,\\njust as you\\'re doing now.\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, sir, I shall get to be like them in time, I suppose.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Rather taken aback]  H\\'m!  Well!  That rests with\\nyou.  Now come.  Set your mind to it, like a good fellow.  You\\'re\\nstill quite young.  A man can make himself what he likes.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Wistfully] Yes, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Take a good hold of yourself.  Do you read?\\n\\nFALDER.  I don\\'t take the words in.  [Hanging his head] I know it\\'s\\nno good; but I can\\'t help thinking of what\\'s going on outside.  In my\\ncell I can\\'t see out at all.  It\\'s thick glass, sir.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You\\'ve had a visitor.  Bad news?\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You mustn\\'t think about it.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Looking back at his cell]  How can I help it, sir?\\n\\n     He suddenly becomes motionless as WOODER and the DOCTOR\\n     approach.  The GOVERNOR motions to him to go back into his cell.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Quick and low]  I\\'m quite right in my head, sir.  [He goes\\nback into his cell.]\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [To the DOCTOR]  Just go in and see him, Clements.\\n\\n     The DOCTOR goes into the cell.  The GOVERNOR pushes the door to,\\n     nearly closing it, and walks towards the window.\\n\\nWOODER.  [Following]  Sorry you should be troubled like this, sir.\\nVery contented lot of men, on the whole.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Shortly]  You think so?\\n\\nWOODER.  Yes, sir.  It\\'s Christmas doing it, in my opinion.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [To himself]  Queer, that!\\n\\nWOODER.  Beg pardon, sir?\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Christmas!\\n\\n     He turns towards the window, leaving WOODER looking at him with\\n     a sort of pained anxiety.\\n\\nWOODER.  [Suddenly]  Do you think we make show enough, sir?  If you\\'d\\nlike us to have more holly?\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Not at all, Mr. Wooder.\\n\\nWOODER.  Very good, sir.\\n\\n     The DOCTOR has come out of FALDER\\'s Cell, and the GOVERNOR\\n     beckons to him.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Well?\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  I can\\'t make anything much of him.  He\\'s nervous, of\\ncourse.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  Is there any sort of case to report?  Quite frankly,\\nDoctor.\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  Well, I don\\'t think the separates doing him any good;\\nbut then I could say the same of a lot of them--they\\'d get on better\\nin the shops, there\\'s no doubt.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  You mean you\\'d have to recommend others?\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  A dozen at least.  It\\'s on his nerves.  There\\'s nothing\\ntangible.  That fellow there [pointing to O\\'CLEARY\\'S cell], for\\ninstance--feels it just as much, in his way.  If I once get away from\\nphysical facts--I shan\\'t know where I am.  Conscientiously, sir, I\\ndon\\'t know how to differentiate him.  He hasn\\'t lost weight.  Nothing\\nwrong with his eyes.  His pulse is good.  Talks all right.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  It doesn\\'t amount to melancholia?\\n\\nTHE DOCTOR.  [Shaking his head]  I can report on him if you like; but\\nif I do I ought to report on others.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  I see.  [Looking towards FALDER\\'S cell]  The poor\\ndevil must just stick it then.\\n\\n     As he says thin he looks absently at WOODER.\\n\\nWOODER.  Beg pardon, sir?\\n\\n     For answer the GOVERNOR stares at him, turns on his heel, and\\n     walks away.  There is a sound as of beating on metal.\\n\\nTHE GOVERNOR.  [Stopping]  Mr. Wooder?\\n\\nWOODER.  Banging on his door, sir.  I thought we should have more of\\nthat.\\n\\n     He hurries forward, passing the GOVERNOR, who follows closely.\\n\\n\\n                         The curtain falls.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCENE III\\n\\n     FALDER\\'s cell, a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven\\n     deep, and nine feet high, with a rounded  ceiling.  The floor is\\n     of shiny blackened bricks.  The barred window of opaque glass,\\n     with a ventilator, is high up in the middle of the end wall.  In\\n     the middle of the opposite end wall is the narrow door.  In a\\n     corner are the mattress and bedding rolled up [two blankets, two\\n     sheets, and a coverlet].  Above them is a quarter-circular\\n     wooden shelf, on which is a Bible and several little devotional\\n     books, piled in a symmetrical pyramid; there are also a black\\n     hair brush, tooth-brush, and a bit of soap.  In another corner\\n     is the wooden frame of a bed, standing on end.  There is a dark\\n     ventilator under the window, and another over the door.\\n     FALDER\\'S work [a shirt to which he is putting buttonholes] is\\n     hung to a nail on the wall over a small wooden table, on which\\n     the novel \"Lorna Doone\" lies open.  Low down in the corner by\\n     the door is a thick glass screen, about a foot square, covering\\n     the gas-jet let into the wall. There is also a wooden stool, and\\n     a pair of shoes beneath it.  Three bright round tins are set\\n     under the window.\\n\\n     In fast-failing daylight, FALDER, in his stockings, is seen\\n     standing motionless, with his head inclined towards the door,\\n     listening.  He moves a little closer to the door, his stockinged\\n     feet making no noise.  He stops at the door.  He is trying\\n     harder and harder to hear something, any little thing that is\\n     going on outside.  He springs suddenly upright--as if at a\\n     sound-and remains perfectly motionless.  Then, with a heavy\\n     sigh, he moves to his work, and stands looking at it, with his\\n     head doom; he does a stitch or two, having the air of a man so\\n     lost in sadness that each stitch is, as it were, a coming to\\n     life.  Then turning abruptly, he begins pacing the cell, moving\\n     his head, like an animal pacing its cage.  He stops again at the\\n     door, listens, and, placing the palms of hip hands against it\\n     with his fingers spread out, leans his forehead against the\\n     iron.  Turning from it, presently, he moves slowly back towards\\n     the window, tracing his way with his finger along the top line\\n     of the distemper that runs round the wall.  He stops under the\\n     window, and, picking up the lid of one of the tins, peers into\\n     it.  It has grown very nearly dark.  Suddenly the lid falls out\\n     of his hand with a clatter--the only sound that has broken the\\n     silence--and he stands staring intently at the wall where the\\n     stuff of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness--he\\n     seems to be seeing somebody or something there.  There is a\\n     sharp tap and click; the cell light behind the glass screen has\\n     been turned up.  The cell is brightly lighted.  FALDER is seen\\n     gasping for breath.\\n\\n     A sound from far away, as of distant, dull beating on thick\\n     metal, is suddenly audible.  FALDER shrinks back, not able to\\n     bear this sudden clamour.  But the sound grows, as though some\\n     great tumbril were rolling towards the cell.  And gradually it\\n     seems to hypnotise him.  He begins creeping inch by inch\\n     nearer to the door.  The banging sound, travelling from cell to\\n     cell, draws closer and closer; FALDER\\'S hands are seen moving as\\n     if his spirit had already joined in this beating, and the sound\\n     swells till it seems to have entered the very cell.  He suddenly\\n     raises his clenched fists.  Panting violently, he flings himself\\n     at his door, and beats on it.\\n\\n\\n                         The curtain falls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACT IV\\n\\n     The scene is again COKESON\\'S room, at a few minutes to ten of a\\n     March morning, two years later.  The doors are all open.\\n     SWEEDLE, now blessed with a sprouting moustache, is getting the\\n     offices ready.  He arranges papers on COKESON\\'S table; then goes\\n     to a covered washstand, raises the lid, and looks at himself in\\n     the mirror.  While he is gazing his full RUTH HONEYWILL comes in\\n     through the outer office and stands in the doorway.  There seems\\n     a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual\\n     impassivity.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Suddenly seeing her, and dropping the lid of the washstand\\nwith a bang] Hello!  It\\'s you!\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  There\\'s only me here!  They don\\'t waste their time hurrying\\ndown in the morning.  Why, it must be two years since we had the\\npleasure of seeing you.  [Nervously]  What have you been doing with\\nyourself?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Sardonically] Living.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Impressed]  If you want to see him [he points to COKESON\\'S\\nchair], he\\'ll be here directly--never misses--not much.  [Delicately]\\nI hope our friend\\'s back from the country.  His time\\'s been up these\\nthree months, if I remember.  [RUTH nods] I was awful sorry about\\nthat.  The governor made a mistake--if you ask me.\\n\\nRUTH.  He did.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  He ought to have given him a chanst.  And, I say, the judge\\nought to ha\\' let him go after that.  They\\'ve forgot what human\\nnature\\'s like.  Whereas we know. [RUTH gives him a honeyed smile]\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  They come down on you like a cartload of bricks, flatten\\nyou out, and when you don\\'t swell up again they complain of it.  I\\nknow \\'em--seen a lot of that sort of thing in my time.  [He shakes\\nhis head in the plenitude of wisdom]  Why, only the other day the\\ngovernor----\\n\\n     But COKESON has come in through the outer office; brisk with\\n     east wind, and decidedly greyer.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Drawing off his coat and gloves]  Why! it\\'s you!  [Then\\nmotioning SWEEDLE out, and closing the door]  Quite a stranger!  Must\\nbe two years.  D\\'you want to see me?  I can give you a minute.  Sit\\ndown!  Family well?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes.  I\\'m not living where I was.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Eyeing her askance] I hope things are more comfortable at\\nhome.\\n\\nRUTH.  I couldn\\'t stay with Honeywill, after all.\\n\\nCOKESON.  You haven\\'t done anything rash, I hope.  I should be sorry\\nif you\\'d done anything rash.\\n\\nRUTH.  I\\'ve kept the children with me.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had\\nhoped]  Well, I\\'m glad to have seen you.  You\\'ve not heard from the\\nyoung man, I suppose, since he came out?\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, I ran across him yesterday.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I hope he\\'s well.\\n\\nRUTH.  [With sudden fierceness]  He can\\'t get anything to do.  It\\'s\\ndreadful to see him.  He\\'s just skin and bone.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With genuine concern] Dear me!  I\\'m sorry to hear that.\\n[On his guard again]  Didn\\'t they find him a place when his time was\\nup?\\n\\nRUTH.  He was only there three weeks.  It got out.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m sure I don\\'t know what I can do for you.  I don\\'t like\\nto be snubby.\\n\\nRUTH.  I can\\'t bear his being like that.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Scanning her not unprosperous figure] I know his relations\\naren\\'t very forthy about him.  Perhaps you can do something for him,\\ntill he finds his feet.\\n\\nRUTH.  Not now.  I could have--but not now.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I don\\'t understand.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Proudly]  I\\'ve seen him again--that\\'s all over.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Staring at her--disturbed]  I\\'m a family man--I don\\'t want\\nto hear anything unpleasant.  Excuse me--I\\'m very busy.\\n\\nRUTH.  I\\'d have gone home to my people in the country long ago, but\\nthey\\'ve never got over me marrying Honeywill.  I never was waywise,\\nMr. Cokeson, but I\\'m proud.  I was only a girl, you see, when I\\nmarried him.  I thought the world of him, of course...  he used\\nto come travelling to our farm.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Regretfully]  I did hope you\\'d have got on better, after\\nyou saw me.\\n\\nRUTH.  He used me worse than ever.  He couldn\\'t break my nerve, but I\\nlost my health; and then he began knocking the children about.  I\\ncouldn\\'t stand that.  I wouldn\\'t go back now, if he were dying.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a\\nstream of lava] We mustn\\'t be violent, must we?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Smouldering]  A man that can\\'t behave better than that--\\n[There is silence]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Fascinated in spite of himself]  Then there you were!  And\\nwhat did you do then?\\n\\nRUTH.  [With a shrug]  Tried the same as when I left him before...,\\nmaking skirts... cheap things.  It was the best I could get, but I\\nnever made more than ten shillings a week, buying my own cotton and\\nworking all day; I hardly ever got to bed till past twelve.  I kept\\nat it for nine months.  [Fiercely]  Well, I\\'m not fit for that; I\\nwasn\\'t made for it.  I\\'d rather die.\\n\\nCOKESON.  My dear woman!  We mustn\\'t talk like that.\\n\\nRUTH.  It was starvation for the children too--after what they\\'d\\nalways had.  I soon got not to care.  I used to be too tired. [She is\\nsilent]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With fearful curiosity]  Why, what happened then?\\n\\nRUTH.  [With a laugh] My employer happened then--he\\'s happened ever\\nsince.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Dear!  Oh dear!  I never came across a thing like this.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Dully] He\\'s treated me all right.  But I\\'ve done with that.\\n[Suddenly her lips begin to quiver, and she hides them with the back\\nof her hand] I never thought I\\'d see him again, you see.  It was just\\na chance I met him by Hyde Park.  We went in there and sat down, and\\nhe told me all about himself.  Oh!  Mr. Cokeson, give him another\\nchance.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Greatly disturbed]  Then you\\'ve both lost your livings!\\nWhat a horrible position!\\n\\nRUTH.  If he could only get here--where there\\'s nothing to find out\\nabout him!\\n\\nCOKESON.  We can\\'t have anything derogative to the firm.\\n\\nRUTH.  I\\'ve no one else to go to.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'ll speak to the partners, but I don\\'t think they\\'ll take\\nhim, under the circumstances.  I don\\'t really.\\n\\nRUTH.  He came with me; he\\'s down there in the street. [She points to\\nthe window.]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [On his dignity] He shouldn\\'t have done that until he\\'s\\nsent for.  [Then softening at the look on her face]  We\\'ve got a\\nvacancy, as it happens, but I can\\'t promise anything.\\n\\nRUTH.  It would be the saving of him.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Well, I\\'ll do what I can, but I\\'m not sanguine.  Now tell\\nhim that I don\\'t want him till I see how things are.  Leave your\\naddress?  [Repeating her] 83 Mullingar Street?  [He notes it on\\nblotting-paper] Good-morning.\\n\\nRUTH.  Thank you.\\n\\n     She moves towards the door, turns as if to speak, but does not,\\n     and goes away.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton\\nhandkerchief] What a business!  [Then looking amongst his papers, he\\nsounds his bell.  SWEEDLE answers it]\\n\\nCOKESON.  Was that young Richards coming here to-day after the\\nclerk\\'s place?\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Yes.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Well, keep him in the air; I don\\'t want to see him yet.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  What shall I tell him, sir?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With asperity] invent something.  Use your brains.  Don\\'t\\nstump him off altogether.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Shall I tell him that we\\'ve got illness, sir?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No!  Nothing untrue.  Say I\\'m not here to-day.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Yes, sir.  Keep him hankering?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Exactly.  And look here.  You remember Falder?  I may be\\nhaving him round to see me.  Now, treat him like you\\'d have him treat\\nyou in a similar position.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  I naturally should do.\\n\\nCOKESON.  That\\'s right.  When a man\\'s down never hit \\'im.  \\'Tisn\\'t\\nnecessary.  Give him a hand up.  That\\'s a metaphor I recommend to you\\nin life.  It\\'s sound policy.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Do you think the governors will take him on again, sir?\\n\\nCOKESON.  Can\\'t say anything about that.  [At the sound of some one\\nhaving entered the outer office]  Who\\'s there?\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Going to the door and looking] It\\'s Falder, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Vexed]  Dear me!  That\\'s very naughty of her.  Tell him to\\ncall again.  I don\\'t want----\\n\\n     He breaks off as FALDER comes in.  FALDER is thin, pale, older,\\n     his eyes have grown more restless.  His clothes are very worn\\n     and loose.\\n\\n     SWEEDLE, nodding cheerfully, withdraws.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Glad to see you.  You\\'re rather previous.  [Trying to keep\\nthings pleasant]  Shake hands!  She\\'s striking while the iron\\'s hot.\\n[He wipes his forehead] I don\\'t blame her.  She\\'s anxious.\\n\\n     FALDER  timidly takes COKESON\\'s hand and glances towards the\\n     partners\\' door.\\n\\nCOKESON.  No--not yet!  Sit down!  [FALDER sits in the chair at the\\naide of COKESON\\'s table, on which he places his cap]  Now you are\\nhere I\\'d like you to give me a little account of yourself.  [Looking\\nat him over his spectacles]  How\\'s your health?\\n\\nFALDER.  I\\'m alive, Mr. Cokeson.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Preoccupied]  I\\'m glad to hear that.  About this matter.\\nI don\\'t like doing anything out of the ordinary; it\\'s not my habit.\\nI\\'m a plain man, and I want everything smooth and straight.  But I\\npromised your friend to speak to the partners, and I always keep my\\nword.\\n\\nFALDER.  I just want a chance, Mr. Cokeson.  I\\'ve paid for that job a\\nthousand times and more.  I have, sir.  No one knows.  They say I\\nweighed more when I came out than when I went in.  They couldn\\'t\\nweigh me here [he touches his head]  or here [he touches--his heart,\\nand gives a sort of laugh].  Till last night I\\'d have thought there\\nwas nothing in here at all.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Concerned] You\\'ve not got heart disease?\\n\\nFALDER.  Oh!  they passed me sound enough.\\n\\nCOKESON.  But they got you a place, didn\\'t they?\\n\\nFALSER.  Yes; very good people, knew all about it--very kind to me.\\nI thought I was going to get on first rate.  But one day, all of a\\nsudden, the other clerks got wind of it....  I couldn\\'t stick it, Mr.\\nCOKESON, I couldn\\'t, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON. Easy, my dear fellow, easy!\\n\\nFALDER.  I had one small job after that, but it didn\\'t last.\\n\\nCOKESON.  How was that?\\n\\nFALDER.  It\\'s no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson.  The fact is, I\\nseem to be struggling against a thing that\\'s all round me.  I can\\'t\\nexplain it: it\\'s as if I was in a net; as fast as I cut it here, it\\ngrows up there.  I didn\\'t act as I ought to have, about references;\\nbut what are you to do?  You must have them.  And that made me\\nafraid, and I left.  In fact, I\\'m--I\\'m afraid all the time now.\\n\\n     He bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I feel for you--I do really.  Aren\\'t your sisters going to\\ndo anything for you?\\n\\nFALDER.  One\\'s in consumption.  And the other----\\n\\nCOKESON.  Ye...es.  She told me her husband wasn\\'t quite pleased with\\nyou.\\n\\nFALDER.  When I went there--they were at supper--my sister wanted to\\ngive me a kiss--I know.  But he just looked at her, and said: \"What\\nhave you come for?\"  Well, I pocketed my pride and I said: \"Aren\\'t\\nyou going to give me your hand, Jim?  Cis is, I know,\" I said.  \"Look\\nhere!\" he said, \"that\\'s all very well, but we\\'d better come to an\\nunderstanding.  I\\'ve been expecting you, and I\\'ve made up my mind.\\nI\\'ll give you fifteen pounds to go to Canada with.\"  \"I see,\" I\\nsaid--\"good riddance!  No, thanks; keep your fifteen pounds.\"\\nFriendship\\'s a queer thing when you\\'ve been where I have.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I understand.  Will you take the fifteen pound from me?\\n[Flustered, as FALDER regards him with a queer smile]  Quite without\\nprejudice; I meant it kindly.\\n\\nFALDER.  I\\'m not allowed to leave the country.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Oh!  ye...es--ticket-of-leave?  You aren\\'t looking the\\nthing.\\n\\nFALDER.  I\\'ve slept in the Park three nights this week.  The dawns\\naren\\'t all poetry there.  But meeting her--I feel a different man\\nthis morning.  I\\'ve often thought the being fond of hers the best\\nthing about me; it\\'s sacred, somehow--and yet it did for me.  That\\'s\\nqueer, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m sure we\\'re all very sorry for you.\\n\\nFALDER.  That\\'s what I\\'ve found, Mr. Cokeson.  Awfully sorry for me.\\n[With quiet bitterness]  But it doesn\\'t do to associate with\\ncriminals!\\n\\nCOKESON.  Come, come, it\\'s no use calling yourself names.  That never\\ndid a man any good.  Put a face on it.\\n\\nFALDER.  It\\'s easy enough to put a face on it, sir, when you\\'re\\nindependent.  Try it when you\\'re down like me.  They talk about\\ngiving you your deserts.  Well, I think I\\'ve had just a bit over.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Eyeing him askance over his spectacles]  I hope they haven\\'t\\nmade a Socialist of you.\\n\\n     FALDER is suddenly still, as if brooding over his past self; he\\n     utters a peculiar laugh.\\n\\nCOKESON.  You must give them credit for the best intentions.  Really\\nyou must.  Nobody wishes you harm, I\\'m sure.\\n\\nFALDER.  I believe that, Mr. Cokeson.  Nobody wishes you harm, but\\nthey down you all the same.  This feeling--[He stares round him, as\\nthough at something closing in]  It\\'s crushing me.  [With sudden\\nimpersonality]  I know it is.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Horribly disturbed] There\\'s nothing there!  We must try\\nand take it quiet.  I\\'m sure I\\'ve often had you in my prayers.  Now\\nleave it to me.  I\\'ll use my gumption and take \\'em when they\\'re\\njolly.  [As he speaks the two partners come in]\\n\\nCOKESON  [Rather disconcerted, but trying to put them all at ease]\\nI didn\\'t expect you quite so soon.  I\\'ve just been having a talk with\\nthis young man.  I think you\\'ll remember him.\\n\\nJAMES.  [With a grave, keen look] Quite well.  How are you, Falder?\\n\\nWALTER.  [Holding out his hand almost timidly] Very glad to see you\\nagain, Falder.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Who has recovered his self-control, takes the hand] Thank\\nyou, sir.\\n\\nCOKESON.  Just a word, Mr. James.  [To FALDER, pointing to the\\nclerks\\' office] You might go in there a minute.  You know your way.\\nOur junior won\\'t be coming this morning.  His wife\\'s just had a\\nlittle family.\\n\\n     FALDER, goes uncertainly out into the clerks\\' office.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Confidentially] I\\'m bound to tell you all about it.  He\\'s\\nquite penitent.  But there\\'s a prejudice against him.  And you\\'re not\\nseeing him to advantage this morning; he\\'s under-nourished.  It\\'s\\nvery trying to go without your dinner.\\n\\nJAMES.  Is that so, COKESON?\\n\\nCOKESON.  I wanted to ask you.  He\\'s had his lesson.  Now we know all\\nabout him, and we want a clerk.  There is a young fellow applying,\\nbut I\\'m keeping him in the air.\\n\\nJAMES.  A gaol-bird in the office, COKESON?  I don\\'t see it.\\n\\nWALTER.  \"The rolling of the chariot-wheels of Justice!\"  I\\'ve never\\ngot that out of my head.\\n\\nJAMES.  I\\'ve nothing to reproach myself with in this affair.  What\\'s\\nhe been doing since he came out?\\n\\nCOKESON.  He\\'s had one or two places, but he hasn\\'t kept them.  He\\'s\\nsensitive--quite natural.  Seems to fancy everybody\\'s down on him.\\n\\nJAMES.  Bad sign.  Don\\'t like the fellow--never did from the first.\\n\"Weak character\"\\'s written all over him.\\n\\nWALTER.  I think we owe him a leg up.\\n\\nJAMES.  He brought it all on himself.\\n\\nWALTER.  The doctrine of full responsibility doesn\\'t quite hold in\\nthese days.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Rather grimly]  You\\'ll find it safer to hold it for all\\nthat, my boy.\\n\\nWALTER.  For oneself, yes--not for other people, thanks.\\n\\nJAMES.  Well!  I don\\'t want to be hard.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m glad to hear you say that.  He seems to see something\\n[spreading his arms] round him.  \\'Tisn\\'t healthy.\\n\\nJAMES.  What about that woman he was mixed up with?  I saw some one\\nuncommonly like her outside as we came in.\\n\\nCOKESON.  That!  Well, I can\\'t keep anything from you.  He has met\\nher.\\n\\nJAMES.  Is she with her husband?\\n\\nCOKESON.  No.\\n\\nJAMES.  Falder living with her, I suppose?\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Desperately trying to retain the new-found jollity] I\\ndon\\'t know that of my own knowledge.  \\'Tisn\\'t my business.\\n\\nJAMES.  It\\'s our business, if we\\'re going to engage him, COKESON.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Reluctantly] I ought to tell you, perhaps.  I\\'ve had the\\nparty here this morning.\\n\\nJAMES.  I thought so.  [To WALTER] No, my dear boy, it won\\'t do.  Too\\nshady altogether!\\n\\nCOKESON.  The two things together make it very awkward for you--I see\\nthat.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Tentatively]  I don\\'t quite know what we have to do with\\nhis private life.\\n\\nJAMES.  No, no!  He must make a clean sheet of it, or he can\\'t come\\nhere.\\n\\nWALTER.  Poor devil!\\n\\nCOKESON.  Will you--have him in?  [And as JAMES nods] I think I can\\nget him to see reason.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Grimly] You can leave that to me, COKESON.\\n\\nWALTER.  [To JAMES, in a low voice, while COKESON is summoning\\nFALDER]  His whole future may depend on what we do, dad.\\n\\nFALDER comes in.  He has pulled himself together, and presents a\\nsteady front.\\n\\nJAMES.  Now look here, Falder.  My son and I want to give you another\\nchance; but there are two things I must say to you.  In the first\\nplace: It\\'s no good coming here as a victim.  If you\\'ve any notion\\nthat you\\'ve been unjustly treated--get rid of it.  You can\\'t play\\nfast and loose with morality and hope to go scot-free.  If Society\\ndidn\\'t take care of itself, nobody would--the sooner you realise that\\nthe better.\\n\\nFALDER.  Yes, sir; but--may I say something?\\n\\nJAMES.  Well?\\n\\nFALDER.  I had a lot of time to think it over in prison.  [He stops]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Encouraging him] I\\'m sure you did.\\n\\nFALDER.  There were all sorts there.  And what I mean, sir, is, that\\nif we\\'d been treated differently the first time, and put under\\nsomebody that could look after us a bit, and not put in prison, not a\\nquarter of us would ever have got there.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Shaking his head] I\\'m afraid I\\'ve very grave doubts of that,\\nFalder.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With a gleam of malice] Yes, sir, so I found.\\n\\nJAMES.  My good fellow, don\\'t forget that you began it.\\n\\nFALDER.  I never wanted to do wrong.\\n\\nJAMES.  Perhaps not.  But you did.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With all the bitterness of his past suffering] It\\'s knocked\\nme out of time.  [Pulling himself up]  That is, I mean, I\\'m not what\\nI was.\\n\\nJAMES.  This isn\\'t encouraging for us, Falder.\\n\\nCOKESON.  He\\'s putting it awkwardly, Mr. James.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Throwing over his caution from the intensity of his\\nfeeling]  I mean it, Mr. Cokeson.\\n\\nJAMES.  Now, lay aside all those thoughts, Falder, and look to the\\nfuture.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Almost eagerly] Yes, sir, but you don\\'t understand what\\nprison is.  It\\'s here it gets you.\\n\\n     He grips his chest.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [In a whisper to James] I told you he wanted nourishment.\\n\\nWALTER.  Yes, but, my dear fellow, that\\'ll pass away.  Time\\'s\\nmerciful.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With his face twitching]  I hope so, sir.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Much more gently]  Now, my boy, what you\\'ve got to do is to\\nput all the past behind you and build yourself up a steady\\nreputation.  And that brings me to the second thing.  This woman you\\nwere mixed up with you must give us your word, you know, to have done\\nwith that.  There\\'s no chance of your keeping straight if you\\'re\\ngoing to begin your future with such a relationship.\\n\\nFALDER.  [Looking from one to the other with a hunted expression] But\\nsir...  but sir...  it\\'s the one thing I looked forward to\\nall that time.  And she too...  I couldn\\'t find her before last\\nnight.\\n\\n     During this and what follows COKESON becomes more and more\\n     uneasy.\\n\\nJAMES.  This is painful, Falder.  But you must see for yourself that\\nit\\'s impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything.\\nGive us this proof of your resolve to keep straight, and you can come\\nback--not otherwise.\\n\\nFALDER.  [After staring at JAMES, suddenly stiffens himself]  I\\ncouldn\\'t give her up.  I couldn\\'t!  Oh, sir!\\n\\n     I\\'m all she\\'s got to look to.  And I\\'m sure she\\'s all I\\'ve got.\\n\\nJAMES.  I\\'m very sorry, Falder, but I must be firm.  It\\'s for the\\nbenefit of you both in the long run.  No good can come of this\\nconnection.  It was the cause of all your disaster.\\n\\nFALDER.  But sir, it means-having gone through all that-getting\\nbroken up--my nerves are in an awful state--for nothing.  I did it\\nfor her.\\n\\nJAMES.  Come!  If she\\'s anything of a woman she\\'ll see it for\\nherself.  She won\\'t want to drag you down further.  If there were a\\nprospect of your being able to marry her--it might be another thing.\\n\\nFALDER.  It\\'s not my fault, sir, that she couldn\\'t get rid of him\\n--she would have if she could.  That\\'s been the whole trouble from\\nthe beginning.  [Looking suddenly at WALTER]...  If anybody\\nwould help her!  It\\'s only money wants now, I\\'m sure.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Breaking in, as WALTER hesitates, and is about to speak] I\\ndon\\'t think we need consider that--it\\'s rather far-fetched.\\n\\nFALDER.  [To WALTER, appealing]  He must have given her full cause\\nsince; she could prove that he drove her to leave him.\\n\\nWALTER.  I\\'m inclined to do what you say, Falder, if it can be\\nmanaged.\\n\\nFALDER.  Oh, sir!\\n\\nHe goes to the window and looks down into the street.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Hurriedly]  You don\\'t take me, Mr. Walter.  I have my\\nreasons.\\n\\nFALDER.  [From the window]  She\\'s down there, sir.  Will you see her?\\nI can beckon to her from here.\\n\\n     WALTER hesitates, and looks from COKESON to JAMES.\\n\\nJAMES.  [With a sharp nod] Yes, let her come.\\n\\nFALDER beckons from the window.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [In a low fluster to JAMES and WALTER]  No, Mr. James.\\nShe\\'s not been quite what she ought to ha\\' been, while this young\\nman\\'s been away.  She\\'s lost her chance.  We can\\'t consult how to\\nswindle the Law.\\n\\n     FALDER has come from the window.  The three men look at him in a\\n     sort of awed silence.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With instinctive apprehension of some change--looking from\\none to the other]  There\\'s been nothing between us, sir, to prevent\\nit....  What I said at the trial was true.  And last night we\\nonly just sat in the Park.\\n\\nSWEEDLE comes in from the outer office.\\n\\nCOKESON.  What is it?\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  Mrs. Honeywill.   [There is silence]\\n\\nJAMES.  Show her in.\\n\\n     RUTH comes slowly in, and stands stoically with FALDER on one\\n     side and the three men on the other.  No one speaks.  COKESON\\n     turns to his table, bending over his papers as though the burden\\n     of the situation were forcing him back into his accustomed\\n     groove.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Sharply]  Shut the door there.  [SWEEDLE shuts the door]\\nWe\\'ve asked you to come up because there are certain facts to be\\nfaced in this matter.  I understand you have only just met Falder\\nagain.\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes--only yesterday.\\n\\nJAMES.  He\\'s told us about himself, and we\\'re very sorry for him.\\nI\\'ve promised to take him back here if he\\'ll make a fresh start.\\n[Looking steadily at RUTH] This is a matter that requires courage,\\nma\\'am.\\n\\nRUTH, who is looking at FALDER, begins to twist her hands in front of\\nher as though prescient of disaster.\\n\\nFALDER.  Mr. Walter How is good enough to say that he\\'ll help us to\\nget you a divorce.\\n\\n     RUTH flashes a startled glance at JAMES and WALTER.\\n\\nJAMES.  I don\\'t think that\\'s practicable, Falder.\\n\\nFALDER.  But, Sir----!\\n\\nJAMES.  [Steadily]  Now, Mrs. Honeywill.  You\\'re fond of him.\\n\\nRUTH.  Yes, Sir; I love him.\\n\\n     She looks miserably at FALDER.\\n\\nJAMES.  Then you don\\'t want to stand in his way, do you?\\n\\nRUTH.  [In a faint voice] I could take care of him.\\n\\nJAMES.  The best way you can take care of him will be to give him up.\\n\\nFALDER.  Nothing shall make me give you up.  You can get a divorce.\\nThere\\'s been nothing between us, has there?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Mournfully shaking her head-without looking at him]  No.\\n\\nFALDER.  We\\'ll keep apart till it\\'s over, sir; if you\\'ll only help\\nus--we promise.\\n\\nJAMES.  [To RUTH]  You see the thing plainly, don\\'t you?  You see\\nwhat I mean?\\n\\nRUTH.  [Just above a whisper]  Yes.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [To himself] There\\'s a dear woman.\\n\\nJAMES.  The situation is impossible.\\n\\nRUTH.  Must I, Sir?\\n\\nJAMES.  [Forcing himself to look at her] I put it to you, ma\\'am.  His\\nfuture is in your hands.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Miserably] I want to do the best for him.\\n\\nJAMES.  [A little huskily] That\\'s right, that\\'s right!\\n\\nFALDER.  I don\\'t understand.  You\\'re not going to give me up--after\\nall this?  There\\'s something--[Starting forward to JAMES] Sir, I\\nswear solemnly there\\'s been nothing between us.\\n\\nJAMES.  I believe you, Falder.  Come, my lad, be as plucky as she is.\\n\\nFALDER.  Just now you were going to help us.  [He starts at RUTH, who\\nis standing absolutely still; his face and hands twitch and quiver as\\nthe truth dawns on him]  What is it?  You\\'ve not been--\\n\\nWALTER.  Father!\\n\\nJAMES.  [Hurriedly]  There, there!  That\\'ll do, that\\'ll do!  I\\'ll\\ngive you your chance, Falder.  Don\\'t let me know what you do with\\nyourselves, that\\'s all.\\n\\nFALDER.  [As if he has not heard] Ruth?\\n\\n     RUTH looks at him; and FALDER covers his face with his hands.\\n     There is silence.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Suddenly]  There\\'s some one out there.  [To RUTH]  Go in\\nhere.  You\\'ll feel better by yourself for a minute.\\n\\n     He points to the clerks\\' room and moves towards the outer\\n     office.  FALDER does not move.  RUTH puts out her hand timidly.\\n     He shrinks back from the touch.  She turns and goes miserably\\n     into the clerks\\' room.  With a brusque movement he follows,\\n     seizing her by the shoulder just inside the doorway.  COKESON\\n     shuts the door.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Pointing to the outer office]  Get rid of that, whoever it\\nis.\\n\\nSWEEDLE.  [Opening the office door, in a scared voice]\\nDetective-Sergeant blister.\\n\\n     The detective enters, and closes the door behind him.\\n\\nWISTER.  Sorry to disturb you, sir.  A clerk you had here, two years\\nand a half ago: I arrested him in, this room.\\n\\nJAMES.  What about him?\\n\\nWISTER.  I thought perhaps I might get his whereabouts from you.\\n[There is an awkward silence]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Pleasantly, coming to the rescue] We\\'re not responsible\\nfor his movements; you know that.\\n\\nJAMES.  What do you want with him?\\n\\nWISTER.  He\\'s failed to report himself this last four weeks.\\n\\nWALTER.  How d\\'you mean?\\n\\nWISTER.  Ticket-of-leave won\\'t be up for another six months, sir.\\n\\nWALTER.  Has he to keep in touch with the police till then?\\n\\nWISTER.  We\\'re bound to know where he sleeps every night.  I dare say\\nwe shouldn\\'t interfere, sir, even though he hasn\\'t reported himself.\\nBut we\\'ve just heard there\\'s a serious matter of obtaining employment\\nwith a forged reference.  What with the two things together--we must\\nhave him.\\n\\n     Again there is silence.  WALTER and COKESON steal glances at\\n     JAMES, who stands staring steadily at the detective.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Expansively]  We\\'re very busy at the moment.  If you could\\nmake it convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Decisively] I\\'m a servant of the Law, but I dislike\\npeaching.  In fact, I can\\'t do such a thing.  If you want him you\\nmust find him without us.\\n\\n     As he speaks his eye falls on FALDER\\'S cap, still lying on the\\n     table, and his face contracts.\\n\\nWISTER.  [Noting the gesture--quietly]  Very good, sir.  I ought to\\nwarn you that, having broken the terms of his licence, he\\'s still a\\nconvict, and sheltering a convict.\\n\\nJAMES.  I shelter no one.  But you mustn\\'t come here and ask\\nquestions which it\\'s not my business to answer.\\n\\nWISTER.  [Dryly] I won\\'t trouble you further then, gentlemen.\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'m sorry we couldn\\'t give you the information.  You quite\\nunderstand, don\\'t you?  Good-morning!\\n\\n     WISTER turns to go, but instead of going to the door of the\\n     outer office he goes to the door of the clerks\\' room.\\n\\nCOKESON.  The other door....  the other door!\\n\\n     WISTER opens the clerks\\' door.  RUTHS\\'s voice is heard: \"Oh,\\n     do!\" and FALDER\\'S: \"I can\\'t!\"  There is a little pause; then,\\n     with sharp fright, RUTH says: \"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n     WISTER has gone in.\\n\\n     The three men look aghast at the door.\\n\\nWISTER  [From within]  Keep back, please!\\n\\n     He comes swiftly out with his arm twisted in FALDER\\'S.  The\\n     latter gives a white, staring look at the three men.\\n\\nWALTER.  Let him go this time, for God\\'s sake!\\n\\nWISTER.  I couldn\\'t take the responsibility, sir.\\n\\nFALDER.  [With a queer, desperate laugh]  Good!\\n\\n     Flinging a look back at RUTH, he throws up his head, and goes\\n     out through the outer office, half dragging WISTER after him.\\n\\nWALTER.  [With despair]  That finishes him.  It\\'ll go on for ever\\nnow.\\n\\n     SWEEDLE can be seen staring through the outer door.  There are\\n     sounds of footsteps descending the stone stairs; suddenly a dull\\n     thud, a faint \"My God!\" in WISTER\\'s voice.\\n\\nJAMES.  What\\'s that?\\n\\n     SWEEDLE dashes forward.  The door swings to behind him.  There\\n     is dead silence.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Starting forward to the inner room] The woman-she\\'s\\nfainting!\\n\\n     He and COKESON support the fainting RUTH from the doorway of the\\n     clerks\\' room.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Distracted]  Here, my dear!  There, there!\\n\\nWALTER.  Have you any brandy?\\n\\nCOKESON.  I\\'ve got sherry.\\n\\nWALTER.  Get it, then.  Quick!\\n\\n     He places RUTH in a chair--which JAMES has dragged forward.\\n\\nCOKESON.  [With sherry] Here!  It\\'s good strong sherry.  [They try to\\nforce the sherry between her lips.]\\n\\n     There is the sound of feet, and they stop to listen.\\n\\n     The outer door is reopened--WISTER and SWEEDLE are seen carrying\\n     some burden.\\n\\nJAMES.  [Hurrying forward]  What is it?\\n\\n     They lay the burden doom in the outer office, out of sight, and\\n     all but RUTH cluster round it, speaking in hushed voices.\\n\\nWISTER.  He jumped--neck\\'s broken.\\n\\nWALTER.  Good God!\\n\\nWISTER.  He must have been mad to think he could give me the slip\\nlike that.  And what was it--just a few months!\\n\\nWALTER.  [Bitterly] Was that all?\\n\\nJAMES.  What a desperate thing!  [Then, in a voice unlike his own]\\nRun for a doctor--you!  [SWEEDLE rushes from the outer office] An\\nambulance!\\n\\n     WISTER goes out.  On RUTH\\'s face an expression of fear and\\n     horror has been seen growing, as if she dared not turn towards\\n     the voices.  She now rises and steals towards them.\\n\\nWALTER.  [Turning suddenly] Look!\\n\\n     The three men shrink back out of her way, one by one, into\\n     COKESON\\'S room.  RUTH drops on her knees by the body.\\n\\nRUTH.  [In a whisper]  What is it?  He\\'s not breathing.  [She\\ncrouches over him]  My dear!  My pretty!\\n\\n     In the outer office doorway the figures of men am seen standing.\\n\\nRUTH.  [Leaping to her feet] No, no!  No, no!  He\\'s dead!\\n\\n     [The figures of the men shrink back]\\n\\nCOKESON.  [Stealing forward.  In a hoarse voice] There, there, poor\\ndear woman!\\n\\n     At the sound behind her RUTH faces round at him.\\n\\nCOKESON.  No one\\'ll touch him now!  Never again!  He\\'s safe with\\ngentle Jesus!\\n\\n     RUTH stands as though turned to stone in the doorway staring at\\n     COKESON, who, bending humbly before her, holds out his hand as\\n     one would to a lost dog.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe curtain falls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n End of Project Gutenberg\\'s Justice (Second Series Plays), by John Galsworthy\\n\\n *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JUSTICE (SECOND SERIES PLAYS) ***\\n\\n ***** This file should be named 2911.txt or 2911.zip *****\\n This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n         http://www.gutenberg.net/2/9/1/2911/\\n\\n Produced by David Widger\\n\\n Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\n will be renamed.\\n\\n Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\n one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\n permission and without paying copyright royalties.

I GO TO STYLES\\n\\nThe intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\\ntime as â\\x80\\x9cThe Styles Caseâ\\x80\\x9d has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\\nview of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\\nboth by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\\nof the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\\nsensational rumours which still persist.\\n\\nI will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\\nbeing connected with the affair.\\n\\nI had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\\nmonths in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a monthâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\\nup my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\\nvery little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\\nparticularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\\nthing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\\nI had often stayed at Styles, his motherâ\\x80\\x99s place in Essex.\\n\\nWe had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\\ndown to Styles to spend my leave there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe mater will be delighted to see you againâ\\x80\\x94after all those years,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe added.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour mother keeps well?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\\nhad married Johnâ\\x80\\x99s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\\na handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\\nnot be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\\nautocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\\nnotoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\\nBountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\\nfortune of her own.\\n\\nTheir country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\\nearly in their married life. He had been completely under his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\\nlifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\\nwas distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\\nalways been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\\ntime of their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s remarriage that they always thought of her as\\ntheir own mother.\\n\\nLawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\\ndoctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\\nhome while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\\nmarked success.\\n\\nJohn practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\\ndown to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\\nyears ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\\nentertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\\nto increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\\nof his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\\nown plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\\ncase she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\\n\\nJohn noticed my surprise at the news of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s remarriage and\\nsmiled rather ruefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRotten little bounder too!â\\x80\\x9d he said savagely. â\\x80\\x9cI can tell you,\\nHastings, itâ\\x80\\x99s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evieâ\\x80\\x94you\\nremember Evie?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I suppose she was after your time. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s the materâ\\x80\\x99s factotum,\\ncompanion, Jack of all trades! A great sportâ\\x80\\x94old Evie! Not precisely\\nyoung and beautiful, but as game as they make them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were going to sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\\nsecond cousin or something of Evieâ\\x80\\x99s, though she didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem\\nparticularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\\nabsolute outsider, anyone can see that. Heâ\\x80\\x99s got a great black beard,\\nand wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\\nto him at once, took him on as secretaryâ\\x80\\x94you know how sheâ\\x80\\x99s always\\nrunning a hundred societies?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\\ndoubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\\nall down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\\nthat she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\\nyears younger than she is! Itâ\\x80\\x99s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\\nthere you areâ\\x80\\x94she is her own mistress, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s married him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt must be a difficult situation for you all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDifficult! Itâ\\x80\\x99s damnable!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\\nat Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\\nfor existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\\nlanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\\nto the car.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGot a drop or two of petrol still, you see,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9cMainly\\nowing to the materâ\\x80\\x99s activities.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\\nlittle station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\\nwas a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\\nEssex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\\nseemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\\nwar was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\\ninto another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid youâ\\x80\\x99ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow, thatâ\\x80\\x99s just what I want.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\\nwith the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\\nworks regularly â\\x80\\x98on the landâ\\x80\\x99. She is up at five every morning to milk,\\nand keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a jolly good life taking\\nit all roundâ\\x80\\x94if it werenâ\\x80\\x99t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!â\\x80\\x9d He\\nchecked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder if weâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ntime to pick up Cynthia. No, sheâ\\x80\\x99ll have started from the hospital by\\nnow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCynthia! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s not your wife?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Cynthia is a protÃ©gÃ©e of my motherâ\\x80\\x99s, the daughter of an old\\nschoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\\ncropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\\nto the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\\nworks in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\\nA lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\\nstraightened herself at our approach.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHullo, Evie, hereâ\\x80\\x99s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94Miss Howard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\\nimpression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\\npleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\\nin its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\\nfeet to matchâ\\x80\\x94these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\\nI soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeeds grow like house afire. Canâ\\x80\\x99t keep even with â\\x80\\x99em. Shall press you\\nin. Better be careful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nresponded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t say it. Never does. Wish you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t later.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re a cynic, Evie,â\\x80\\x9d said John, laughing. â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s tea to-dayâ\\x80\\x94inside\\nor out?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome on then, youâ\\x80\\x99ve done enough gardening for to-day. â\\x80\\x98The labourer\\nis worthy of his hireâ\\x80\\x99, you know. Come and be refreshed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m\\ninclined to agree with you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\\nof a large sycamore.\\n\\nA figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\\nmeet us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy wife, Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d said John.\\n\\nI shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\\nslender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\\nslumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\\ntawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nthat I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\\nwhich nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\\nan exquisitely civilised bodyâ\\x80\\x94all these things are burnt into my\\nmemory. I shall never forget them.\\n\\nShe greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\\nvoice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\\nhad accepted Johnâ\\x80\\x99s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\\nher few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\\nthoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\\nstimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\\nof my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\\namused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\\nhardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\\n\\nAt that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\\nwindow near at hand:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen youâ\\x80\\x99ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll write to\\nLady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\\nhear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\\nopen it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then thereâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nDuchessâ\\x80\\x94about the school fÃªte.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was the murmur of a manâ\\x80\\x99s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s rose\\nin reply:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\\nAlfred dear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\\nwhite-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\\nstepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\\ndeference in his manner.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\\nall these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94my husband.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked with some curiosity at â\\x80\\x9cAlfred darlingâ\\x80\\x9d. He certainly struck a\\nrather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\\nwas one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\\ngold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\\nstruck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\\nof place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\\nplaced a wooden hand in mine and said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d Then, turning to his wife: â\\x80\\x9cEmily\\ndearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\\ndemonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\\notherwise sensible woman!\\n\\nWith the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\\nhostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\\nparticular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nhowever, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\\nremembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\\npoured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\\nforthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\\nshortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\\ndays or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\\nvery first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\\nmyself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\\n\\nPresently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\\nletters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\\npainstaking voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, before the war I was in Lloydâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you will return there after it is over?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMary Cavendish leant forward.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\\nconsult your inclination?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, that depends.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo secret hobby?â\\x80\\x9d she asked. â\\x80\\x9cTell meâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99re drawn to something?\\nEveryone isâ\\x80\\x94usually something absurd.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll laugh at me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe real thingâ\\x80\\x94Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\\ndrawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\\ndetective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\\nHe used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\\nmethod. My system is based on hisâ\\x80\\x94though of course I have progressed\\nrather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\\nwonderfully clever.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLike a good detective story myself,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Miss Howard. â\\x80\\x9cLots of\\nnonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\\ndumbfounded. Real crimeâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99d know at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,â\\x80\\x9d I argued.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\\nfamily. You couldnâ\\x80\\x99t really hoodwink them. Theyâ\\x80\\x99d know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen,â\\x80\\x9d I said, much amused, â\\x80\\x9cyou think that if you were mixed up in a\\ncrime, say a murder, youâ\\x80\\x99d be able to spot the murderer right off?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course I should. Mightnâ\\x80\\x99t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\\nBut Iâ\\x80\\x99m certain Iâ\\x80\\x99d know. Iâ\\x80\\x99d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might be a â\\x80\\x98sheâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d I suggested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMight. But murderâ\\x80\\x99s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in a case of poisoning.â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s clear voice startled me.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\\nignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\\nthere were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Inglethorp. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\nmakes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nCynthia!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94Miss Murdoch.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\\nvigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\\nloose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\\nhand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\\nwould have been a beauty.\\n\\nShe flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\\nplate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSit down here on the grass, do. Itâ\\x80\\x99s ever so much nicer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI dropped down obediently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou work at Tadminster, donâ\\x80\\x99t you, Miss Murdoch?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor my sins.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo they bully you, then?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should like to see them!â\\x80\\x9d cried Cynthia with dignity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have got a cousin who is nursing,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked. â\\x80\\x9cAnd she is terrified\\nof â\\x80\\x98Sistersâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\\n_are_! Youâ\\x80\\x99ve no idea! But Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\\ndispensary.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow many people do you poison?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, smiling.\\n\\nCynthia smiled too.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, hundreds!â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCynthia,â\\x80\\x9d called Mrs. Inglethorp, â\\x80\\x9cdo you think you could write a few\\nnotes for me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, Aunt Emily.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\\nher position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\\nmight be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\\n\\nMy hostess turned to me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\\ngiven up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Memberâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwifeâ\\x80\\x94she was the late Lord Abbotsburyâ\\x80\\x99s daughterâ\\x80\\x94does the same. She\\nagrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\\nwar household; nothing is wasted hereâ\\x80\\x94every scrap of waste paper, even,\\nis saved and sent away in sacks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\\nbroad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\\nwings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\\nover the park.\\n\\nJohn left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\\nslowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\\nInglethorp call â\\x80\\x9cCynthiaâ\\x80\\x9d impatiently, and the girl started and ran\\nback to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\\nshadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\\nabout forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\\nviolent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\\nas he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\\nfifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was Johnâ\\x80\\x99s younger\\nbrother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\\nthat singular expression to his face.\\n\\nThen I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\\nmy own affairs.\\n\\nThe evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\\nenigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\\n\\nThe next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\\nanticipation of a delightful visit.\\n\\nI did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\\ntake me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\\nwoods, returning to the house about five.\\n\\nAs we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\\nsmoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\\noccurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, Mary, thereâ\\x80\\x99s the deuce of a mess. Evieâ\\x80\\x99s had a row with\\nAlfred Inglethorp, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvie? Off?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn nodded gloomily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; you see she went to the mater, andâ\\x80\\x94Oh,â\\x80\\x94hereâ\\x80\\x99s Evie herself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\\na small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\\nthe defensive.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt any rate,â\\x80\\x9d she burst out, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve spoken my mind!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Evelyn,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Cavendish, â\\x80\\x9cthis canâ\\x80\\x99t be true!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard nodded grimly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTrue enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she wonâ\\x80\\x99t forget or\\nforgive in a hurry. Donâ\\x80\\x99t mind if theyâ\\x80\\x99ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\\nwater off a duckâ\\x80\\x99s back, though. I said right out: â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99re an old\\nwoman, Emily, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no fool like an old fool. The manâ\\x80\\x99s twenty\\nyears younger than you, and donâ\\x80\\x99t you fool yourself as to what he\\nmarried you for. Money! Well, donâ\\x80\\x99t let him have too much of it. Farmer\\nRaikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\\ntime he spends over there.â\\x80\\x99 She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\\nsoon murder you in your bed as look at you. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a bad lot. You can say\\nwhat you like to me, but remember what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve told you. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a bad lot!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did she say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Darling Alfredâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98dearest Alfredâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98wicked calumniesâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98wicked\\nliesâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98wicked womanâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94to accuse her â\\x80\\x98dear husband!â\\x80\\x99 The sooner I left\\nher house the better. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut not now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis minute!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\\nhis persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\\nfollowed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\\nthink better of it.\\n\\nAs she left the room, Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x99s face changed. She leant towards me\\neagerly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Hastings, youâ\\x80\\x99re honest. I can trust you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\\nvoice to a whisper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re a lot of\\nsharksâ\\x80\\x94all of them. Oh, I know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m talking about. There isnâ\\x80\\x99t one\\nof them thatâ\\x80\\x99s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nprotected her as much as I could. Now Iâ\\x80\\x99m out of the way, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nimpose upon her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, Miss Howard,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do everything I can, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nsure youâ\\x80\\x99re excited and overwrought.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYoung man, trust me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lived in the world rather longer than you\\nhave. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see what I mean.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\\nrose and moved to the door. Johnâ\\x80\\x99s voice sounded outside. With her hand\\non the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\\nme.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbove all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devilâ\\x80\\x94her husband!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\\nchorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\\n\\nAs the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\\nthe group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\\nbearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\\nrose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho is that?â\\x80\\x9d I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s Dr. Bauerstein,â\\x80\\x9d said John shortly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd who is Dr. Bauerstein?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\\nbreakdown. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a London specialist; a very clever manâ\\x80\\x94one of the\\ngreatest living experts on poisons, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd heâ\\x80\\x99s a great friend of Maryâ\\x80\\x99s,â\\x80\\x9d put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\\nalways had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\\nthan Evelyn Howard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\\nvillage through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\\n\\nAs we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\\nyoung woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\\nsmiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty girl,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked appreciatively.\\n\\nJohnâ\\x80\\x99s face hardened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is Mrs. Raikes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe one that Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\\n\\nI thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\\nwicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\\nforeboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStyles is really a glorious old place,â\\x80\\x9d I said to John.\\n\\nHe nodded rather gloomily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, itâ\\x80\\x99s a fine property. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be mine some dayâ\\x80\\x94should be mine now\\nby rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\\nshouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be so damned hard up as I am now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHard up, are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Hastings, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind telling you that Iâ\\x80\\x99m at my witsâ\\x80\\x99 end\\nfor money.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCouldnâ\\x80\\x99t your brother help you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLawrence? Heâ\\x80\\x99s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\\nverses in fancy bindings. No, weâ\\x80\\x99re an impecunious lot. My motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nalways been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\\nher marriage, of courseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he broke off, frowning.\\n\\nFor the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\\nindefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\\nsecurity. Now that security was removedâ\\x80\\x94and the air seemed rife with\\nsuspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\\nunpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\\nmind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\\n\\nI had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\\nthe 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\\nwill recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\\npossible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\\nlong and tedious cross-examinations.\\n\\nI received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\\ndeparture, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\\nMiddlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\\nme to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\\nreconciled.\\n\\nThe only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s\\nextraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\\nsociety of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\\nbut she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\\nlong expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\\nsee his attraction.\\n\\nThe 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\\nbazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\\nwith the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\\npoem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\\narranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\\nplace. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\\ngarden. I noticed that Johnâ\\x80\\x99s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\\nvery excited and restless.\\n\\nAfter tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\\nin the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\\n\\nAbout a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\\nlate as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\\nready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\\nthe door.\\n\\nThe entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s recitation\\nreceiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\\nCynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\\nsupper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\\nacting with her in the tableaux.\\n\\nThe following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\\nshe was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\\n12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuch a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminsterâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conquerorâ\\x80\\x94one of\\nour oldest families.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\\nBauerstein.\\n\\nWe had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\\nthat we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\\nway, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\\nreplied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\\nto write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\\nin the pony-trap.\\n\\nWe were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\\nappeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\\noverall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\\ndispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\\naddressed as â\\x80\\x9cNibs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a lot of bottles!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\\nsmall room. â\\x80\\x9cDo you really know whatâ\\x80\\x99s in them all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSay something original,â\\x80\\x9d groaned Cynthia. â\\x80\\x9cEvery single person who\\ncomes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\\nthe first individual who does _not_ say: â\\x80\\x98What a lot of bottles!â\\x80\\x99 And I\\nknow the next thing youâ\\x80\\x99re going to say is: â\\x80\\x98How many people have you\\npoisoned?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI pleaded guilty with a laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\\nmistake, you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t joke about it. Come on, letâ\\x80\\x99s have tea. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve got\\nall sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\npoison cupboard. The big cupboardâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\\nWe had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\\nThe countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\\nstern and forbidding expression.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in,â\\x80\\x9d said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\\n\\nA young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\\nshe proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\\nenigmatical remark:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_I_â\\x80\\x99m not really here to-day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis should have been sent up this morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSister is very sorry. She forgot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSister should read the rules outside the door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI gathered from the little nurseâ\\x80\\x99s expression that there was not the\\nleast likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\\nthe dreaded â\\x80\\x9cSisterâ\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo now it canâ\\x80\\x99t be done until to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d finished Cynthia.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Cynthia graciously, â\\x80\\x9cwe are very busy, but if we have time\\nit shall be done.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\\nshelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\\ndoor.\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDiscipline must be maintained?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\\nwards there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\\nwards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\\ncalled to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\\nher watch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing more to do, Nibs?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right. Then we can lock up and go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\\nto John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\\nthe opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\\nshy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\\nthat, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\\nhim. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\\nconstrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\\nBut they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\\na couple of children.\\n\\nAs we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\\nstamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\\n\\nAs I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\\nentering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\\nexclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_ Hastings!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cIt is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed.\\n\\nI turned to the pony-trap.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\\nfriend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, we know Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d said Cynthia gaily. â\\x80\\x9cBut I had no idea\\nhe was a friend of yours.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot seriously. â\\x80\\x9cI know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\\nis by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.â\\x80\\x9d Then,\\nas I looked at him inquiringly: â\\x80\\x9cYes, my friend, she had kindly\\nextended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\\nrefugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\\nwith gratitude.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\\nfive feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\\nhead was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\\non one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\\nhis attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\\ncaused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\\nlittle man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\\ntime one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\\ndetective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\\ntriumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\\n\\nHe pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\\nBelgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\\nraised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a dear little man,â\\x80\\x9d said Cynthia. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d no idea you knew him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,â\\x80\\x9d I replied.\\n\\nAnd, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\\nexploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\\n\\nWe arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\\nInglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, itâ\\x80\\x99s you,â\\x80\\x9d she said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?â\\x80\\x9d asked Cynthia.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. â\\x80\\x9cWhat should there be?â\\x80\\x9d\\nThen catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\\ndining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, mâ\\x80\\x99m.â\\x80\\x9d The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou think, mâ\\x80\\x99m, youâ\\x80\\x99d better get to bed? Youâ\\x80\\x99re looking very tired.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps youâ\\x80\\x99re right, Dorcasâ\\x80\\x94yesâ\\x80\\x94noâ\\x80\\x94not now. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve some letters I must\\nfinish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\\nyou?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, mâ\\x80\\x99m.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to bed directly after supper.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoodness gracious! I wonder whatâ\\x80\\x99s up?â\\x80\\x9d she said to Lawrence.\\n\\nHe did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\\nheel and went out of the house.\\n\\nI suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\\nI ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\\n\\nMrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\\nbut she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHad a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, trying to appear as\\nindifferent as I could.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didnâ\\x80\\x99t go,â\\x80\\x9d she replied abruptly. â\\x80\\x9cWhere is Mrs. Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the boudoir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHer hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\\nherself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\\nacross the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\\n\\nAs I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\\nopen boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\\nscrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\\ndesperately controlling herself:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you wonâ\\x80\\x99t show it to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen show it to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\\nleast.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course, I might have known you would shield him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s been the most awful row! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got it all out of\\nDorcas.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of a row?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetween Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope sheâ\\x80\\x99s found him out at last!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas Dorcas there, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course not. She â\\x80\\x98happened to be near the doorâ\\x80\\x99. It was a real old\\nbust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI thought of Mrs. Raikesâ\\x80\\x99s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howardâ\\x80\\x99s warnings,\\nbut wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\\npossible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, â\\x80\\x9cAunt Emily will send him\\naway, and will never speak to him again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\\nEvidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\\nto forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\\nnot dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s\\nconcern in the matter?\\n\\nMr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\\nface was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\\nme afresh.\\n\\nMrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\\nthe meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\\nunusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\\nattentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\\npart of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\\nretired to her boudoir again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSend my coffee in here, Mary,â\\x80\\x9d she called. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve just five minutes to\\ncatch the post.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\\nCavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?â\\x80\\x9d she\\nasked. â\\x80\\x9cWill you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\\nit out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not trouble, Mary,â\\x80\\x9d said Inglethorp. â\\x80\\x9cI will take it to Emily.â\\x80\\x9d He\\npoured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\\n\\nLawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\\n\\nWe three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\\nstill. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s almost too hot,â\\x80\\x9d she murmured. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall have a thunderstorm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\\nrudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\\nvoice in the hall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauerstein!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Cynthia. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a funny time to come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\\nundisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\\n\\nIn a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\\nlatter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\\ndrawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\\nplastered with mud.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you been doing, doctor?â\\x80\\x9d cried Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must make my apologies,â\\x80\\x9d said the doctor. â\\x80\\x9cI did not really mean to\\ncome in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,â\\x80\\x9d said John, strolling in from\\nthe hall. â\\x80\\x9cHave some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, I will.â\\x80\\x9d He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\\nhad discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\\nand in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\\nignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sun soon dried me off,â\\x80\\x9d he added, â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid my appearance is\\nvery disreputable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\\nthe girl ran out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJust carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\\nJohn was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\\nswear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\\nher hand.\\n\\nMy evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\\nBauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\\nhowever, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll walk down to the village with you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Inglethorp. â\\x80\\x9cI must\\nsee our agent over those estate accounts.â\\x80\\x9d He turned to John. â\\x80\\x9cNo one\\nneed sit up. I will take the latch-key.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\\n\\nTo make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\\nfirst floor of Styles. The servantsâ\\x80\\x99 rooms are reached through the door\\nB. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\\nInglethorpsâ\\x80\\x99 rooms were situated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       01\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\\nCavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\\ntold me at once that something was seriously wrong.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\\nmy scattered thoughts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\\nof fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll come at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\\nalong the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\\n\\nJohn Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\\nround in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\\nbrother.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think we had better do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nNever, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\\n\\nJohn rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s door violently, but with\\nno effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\\nhousehold was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\\nfrom the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTry going through Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, sir,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dorcas. â\\x80\\x9cOh, the\\npoor mistress!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with usâ\\x80\\x94that he\\nalone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\\nroom. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\\nand by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\\nthat there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\\n\\nWe went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\\nbolted on the inside. What was to be done?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, dear, sir,â\\x80\\x9d cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, â\\x80\\x9cwhat ever shall we\\ndo?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must try and break the door in, I suppose. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be a tough job,\\nthough. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\\nto go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a try at the door.\\nHalf a moment, though, isnâ\\x80\\x99t there a door into Miss Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s rooms?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s always bolted. Itâ\\x80\\x99s never been undone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we might just see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room. Mary Cavendish was\\nthere, shaking the girlâ\\x80\\x94who must have been an unusually sound\\nsleeperâ\\x80\\x94and trying to wake her.\\n\\nIn a moment or two he was back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo good. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\\none is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\\nand for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\\ngive beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\\nburst open.\\n\\nWe stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\\nInglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\\nconvulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\\nher. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\\nthe pillows.\\n\\nJohn strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\\nthe housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\\nThen he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\\non the corridor.\\n\\nI turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\\nthere was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\\nmy lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any manâ\\x80\\x99s face. He\\nwas white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\\nsputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\\nsome such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\\nthe further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\\nhim to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\\ncould see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\\ngrate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\\nharmless enough.\\n\\nThe violence of Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s attack seemed to be passing. She was\\nable to speak in short gasps.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetter nowâ\\x80\\x94very suddenâ\\x80\\x94stupid of meâ\\x80\\x94to lock myself in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\\nnear the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\\nthe girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\\nheavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoor Cynthia is quite frightened,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\\nvoice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\\nThen it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\\ndaylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\\nclock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five oâ\\x80\\x99clock.\\n\\nA strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\\nthe unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\\nto behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\\nto help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\\nshe appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\\nin an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\\nmore brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\\npeculiar fashion.\\n\\nAt that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\\nroom. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\\nbed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\\nvoice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlfredâ\\x80\\x94Alfredâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\n\\nWith a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\\nthem energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\\nHe issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\\nof his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\\nthough I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\\nnothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\\nthat he himself had little hope.\\n\\nFinally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\\nmoment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\nown doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\\n\\nIn a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\\npassing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\\nhouse as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\\nWith a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVeâ\\x80\\x94ry sad. Veâ\\x80\\x94ry sad,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Dr. Wilkins. â\\x80\\x9cPoor dear lady. Always\\ndid far too muchâ\\x80\\x94far too muchâ\\x80\\x94against my advice. I warned her. Her\\nheart was far from strong. â\\x80\\x98Take it easy,â\\x80\\x99 I said to her,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Takeâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x94easyâ\\x80\\x99. But noâ\\x80\\x94her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\\nrebelled. Naâ\\x80\\x94tureâ\\x80\\x94reâ\\x80\\x94belled.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\\nstill kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\\nyou were not here in time to witness them. They were quiteâ\\x80\\x94tetanic in\\ncharacter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should like to speak to you in private,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Bauerstein. He\\nturned to John. â\\x80\\x9cYou do not object?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\\nand I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\\n\\nWe went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\\ncertain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s manner had started a\\nflock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\\narm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem soâ\\x80\\x94peculiar?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked at her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know what I think?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen!â\\x80\\x9d I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\\nvoice to a whisper. â\\x80\\x9cI believe she has been poisoned! Iâ\\x80\\x99m certain Dr.\\nBauerstein suspects it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_What?_â\\x80\\x9d She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\\nwildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: â\\x80\\x9cNo,\\nnoâ\\x80\\x94not thatâ\\x80\\x94not that!â\\x80\\x9d And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\\nfollowed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\\nagainst the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, noâ\\x80\\x94leave me. Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\\nminute or two. Go down to the others.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\\njoined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\\nus all when I at last broke it by saying:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere is Mr. Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s not in the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\\nand inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s dying words. What lay\\nbeneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\\n\\nAt last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\\nlooking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\\nexultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\\nthe background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\\nspokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that necessary?â\\x80\\x9d asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsolutely,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Bauerstein.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou mean by thatâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\\nunder the circumstances.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn bent his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn that case, I have no alternative but to agree.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Dr. Wilkins briskly. â\\x80\\x9cWe propose that it should take\\nplace to-morrow nightâ\\x80\\x94or rather to-night.â\\x80\\x9d And he glanced at the\\ndaylight. â\\x80\\x9cUnder the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\\nbe avoidedâ\\x80\\x94these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\ndistress yourselves.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\\npocket, and handed them to John.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\\nopinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe doctors then departed.\\n\\nI had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\\nhad now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\\nI knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\\noptimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\\ndifficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\\nother hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\\nfelt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\\nhad come for me to take the lead.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cI am going to ask you something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\\nHe has been a most famous detective.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want you to let me call him inâ\\x80\\x94to investigate this matter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x94now? Before the post-mortem?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, time is an advantage ifâ\\x80\\x94ifâ\\x80\\x94there has been foul play.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRubbish!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lawrence angrily. â\\x80\\x9cIn my opinion the whole thing is a\\nmareâ\\x80\\x99s nest of Bauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s! Wilkins hadnâ\\x80\\x99t an idea of such a thing,\\nuntil Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\\nBauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\\ncourse he sees them everywhere.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI confess that I was surprised by Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x99s attitude. He was so seldom\\nvehement about anything.\\n\\nJohn hesitated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t feel as you do, Lawrence,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m inclined to\\ngive Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t want any unnecessary scandal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d I cried eagerly, â\\x80\\x9cyou need have no fear of that. Poirot is\\ndiscretion itself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\\nThough, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\\nforgive me if I am wronging him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked at my watch. It was six oâ\\x80\\x99clock. I determined to lose no time.\\n\\nFive minutesâ\\x80\\x99 delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\\nransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\\ndescription of strychnine poisoning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. POIROT INVESTIGATES\\n\\nThe house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\\nthe park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\\nlong grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\\naccordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\\nattention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\\nIt was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\\nhis absence?\\n\\nHe accosted me eagerly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere have you been?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDenby kept me late last night. It was one oâ\\x80\\x99clock before weâ\\x80\\x99d\\nfinished. Then I found that Iâ\\x80\\x99d forgotten the latch-key after all. I\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you hear the news?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\\nself-sacrificingâ\\x80\\x94such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\\nwas!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must hurry on,â\\x80\\x9d I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\\nwas bound.\\n\\nIn a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nGetting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\\nwas cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\\n\\nHe gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\\nI explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\\naffair whilst I dress.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\\nroom. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\\nkeeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\\ninsignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\\n\\nI told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s dying words, of her\\nhusbandâ\\x80\\x99s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\\nconversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\\nof the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\\nthe latterâ\\x80\\x99s innuendoes.\\n\\nI was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\\nand occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\\nPoirot smiled kindly on me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\\nagitated; you are excitedâ\\x80\\x94it is but natural. Presently, when we are\\ncalmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\\nwill examineâ\\x80\\x94and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\\nthose of no importance, pouf!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\\npuffed comically enoughâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cblow them away!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all very well,â\\x80\\x9d I objected, â\\x80\\x9cbut how are you going to decide\\nwhat is important, and what isnâ\\x80\\x99t? That always seems the difficulty to\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\\nwith exquisite care.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to anotherâ\\x80\\x94so we continue. Does the\\nnext fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\\nlittle factâ\\x80\\x94no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missingâ\\x80\\x94a link\\nin the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\\ncurious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\\nwe put it here!â\\x80\\x9d He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. â\\x80\\x9cIt is\\nsignificant! It is tremendous!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYâ\\x80\\x94esâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\\nbefore it. â\\x80\\x9cBeware! Peril to the detective who says: â\\x80\\x98It is so smallâ\\x80\\x94it\\ndoes not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.â\\x80\\x99 That way lies\\nconfusion! Everything matters.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know. You always told me that. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I have gone into all the\\ndetails of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\\nme the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\\nnothingâ\\x80\\x94truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowancesâ\\x80\\x94you are upset.\\nTo that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\\nparamount importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is that?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little manâ\\x80\\x99s brain. He\\nwas carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\\nseemed wholly engrossed in the task.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t remember,â\\x80\\x9d I said. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, anyway, I donâ\\x80\\x99t seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not see? But it is of the first importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t see why,â\\x80\\x9d I said, rather nettled. â\\x80\\x9cAs far as I can remember,\\nshe didnâ\\x80\\x99t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\\nappetite away. That was only natural.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully, â\\x80\\x9cit was only natural.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\\nme.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow I am ready. We will proceed to the chÃ¢teau, and study matters on\\nthe spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\\non one side. Permit me.â\\x80\\x9d With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Ã\\x87a y est!_ Now, shall we start?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\\nstopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\\nof park, still glittering with morning dew.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\\nsorrow, prostrated with grief.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\\nunder his prolonged gaze.\\n\\nWas the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\\natmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\\ndeath was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\\nregretted.\\n\\nPoirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, you are right,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cit is not as though there was a blood\\ntie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\\nnot their own mother. Blood tellsâ\\x80\\x94always remember thatâ\\x80\\x94blood tells.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cI wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\\nMrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\\nmind, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t see how it has anything to do with the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\\nsaid:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not mind telling youâ\\x80\\x94though, as you know, it is not my habit to\\nexplain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\\nInglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\\ncoffee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what time was the coffee served?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTherefore she drank it between then and half-past eightâ\\x80\\x94certainly not\\nmuch later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\\nwould be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\\nthe same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\\nthat extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\\naccording to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\\ndo not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\\ncircumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\\nit. In the meantime, remember it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\\nand haggard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHastings\\nhas explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI comprehend perfectly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. It is a matter of precaution only.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\\ncigarette as he did so.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know that fellow Inglethorp is back?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I met him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\\nwas too much for Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\\nneatly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat difficulty will not exist long,â\\x80\\x9d pronounced Poirot quietly.\\n\\nJohn looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\\ncryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\\nhim to me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShow Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe rooms are locked?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\\nappend a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       02\\n\\n\\n\\nPoirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\\ninspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\\nagility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\\nany clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\\nforbearance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have you, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cthat you remain there likeâ\\x80\\x94how\\ndo you say it?â\\x80\\x94ah, yes, the stuck pig?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFoot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\\narmy in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\\nand aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\\nproceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\\nprecipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh voilÃ\\xa0 une table!_â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cAh, my friend, one may live in a\\nbig house and yet have no comfort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\\n\\nA small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\\nwriting-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\\nfrom the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\\nhowever. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\\nwire through the handle.\\n\\nNext, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\\nhimself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\\nopposite leading into Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room. That door was also bolted, as I\\nhad stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\\nand shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\\nagainst making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\\nto rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\\nwhipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\\nminute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\\n\\nOn the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\\nsaucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\\nsaucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\\nnear it.\\n\\nI wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\\nHere was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\\nliquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCocoaâ\\x80\\x94withâ\\x80\\x94I thinkâ\\x80\\x94rum in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\\nbeen overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\\nand the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, this is curious,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not? Observe the lampâ\\x80\\x94the chimney is broken in two places; they\\nlie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\\nto powder.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said wearily, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose someone must have stepped on it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, in an odd voice. â\\x80\\x9cSomeone stepped on it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\\nwhere he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94a trick of his when he was agitated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d he said, turning to me, â\\x80\\x9csomebody stepped on that cup,\\ngrinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\\ncontained strychnine orâ\\x80\\x94which is far more seriousâ\\x80\\x94because it did not\\ncontain strychnine!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\\nasking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\\non with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\\nfloor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\\nvery bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\\ndespatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\\nwell as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\\npocket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\\ndoneâ\\x80\\x94at once!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\\nwash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\\nhardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\\nparticularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutelyâ\\x80\\x94even\\ngoing so far as to smell it.\\n\\nFinally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\\nit up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have found in this room,â\\x80\\x9d he said, writing busily, â\\x80\\x9csix points of\\ninterest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you,â\\x80\\x9d I replied hastily.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\\ntwo, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\\nfloor.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat may have been done some time ago,â\\x80\\x9d I interrupted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\\nfragment of some dark green fabricâ\\x80\\x94only a thread or two, but\\nrecognizable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cThat was what you sealed up in the envelope.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s own\\ndresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!â\\x80\\x9d With a\\ndramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\\nfloor by the writing-table. â\\x80\\x9cIt must have been done since yesterday,\\notherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\\nblotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats onceâ\\x80\\x94but that is not\\nto the point.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou brought only one candle into the room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\\nseemed to see something over hereâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94I indicated the mantelpieceâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat\\nabsolutely paralysed him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is interesting,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot quickly. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it is suggestiveâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94his\\neye sweeping the whole length of the wallâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cbut it was not his candle\\nthat made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\\nwhereas Monsieur Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x99s candle, which is still on the\\ndressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\\ncandlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you deduce?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\\nuse my own natural faculties.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the sixth point?â\\x80\\x9d I asked. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose it is the sample of cocoa.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cI might have included that in the six,\\nbut I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\\npresent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked quickly round the room. â\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing more to be done\\nhere, I think, unlessâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\\nin the grate. â\\x80\\x9cThe fire burnsâ\\x80\\x94and it destroys. But by chanceâ\\x80\\x94there\\nmight beâ\\x80\\x94let us see!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDeftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\\ninto the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\\ngave a faint exclamation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe forceps, Hastings!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\\nof half charred paper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, _mon ami!_â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:â\\x80\\x94\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       03\\n\\n\\nI was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\\nSuddenly an idea struck me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a fragment of a will!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked up at him sharply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not surprised?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he said gravely, â\\x80\\x9cI expected it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\\ncase, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\\nbrain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\\ndestroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\\nObviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\\nbolted on the inside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot briskly, â\\x80\\x9cwe will go. I should like to\\nask a few questions of the parlourmaidâ\\x80\\x94Dorcas, her name is, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe passed through Alfred Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, and Poirot delayed long\\nenough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\\nwent out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room as before.\\n\\nI took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\\nand went myself in search of Dorcas.\\n\\nWhen I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cwhere are you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am here, my friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\\nlost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAdmirable!â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cAdmirable! What symmetry! Observe that\\ncrescent; and those diamondsâ\\x80\\x94their neatness rejoices the eye. The\\nspacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\\nit not so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come inâ\\x80\\x94Dorcas\\nis here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a momentâ\\x80\\x99s satisfaction of the\\neye.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but this affair is more important.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\\nimportance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\\nchose to take that line.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\\ninterview the brave Dorcas.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\\nand her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\\nvery model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\\n\\nIn her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\\nhe soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray be seated, mademoiselle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTen years, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\\nto her, were you not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was a very good mistress to me, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\\nyou with Mr. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s full approval.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, certainly, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\\nafternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t know that I oughtâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Dorcas hesitated.\\n\\nPoirot looked at her keenly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\\nthat quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\\nyour mistressâ\\x80\\x99s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\\nthat we should know allâ\\x80\\x94if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\\nback to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\\nmurderer to justice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmen to that,â\\x80\\x9d said Dorcas fiercely. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, naming no names, thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\n_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\\nwas when first _he_ darkened the threshold.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\\nbusiness-like tone, he asked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterdayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat time was that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t say exactly, sir, but it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t tea-time by a long way.\\nPerhaps four oâ\\x80\\x99clockâ\\x80\\x94or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\\nsaid, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\\nangry in here. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly mean to listen, butâ\\x80\\x94well, there it is.\\nI stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\\nand clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. â\\x80\\x98You have lied to\\nme, and deceived me,â\\x80\\x99 she said. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\\nreplied. He spoke a good bit lower than she didâ\\x80\\x94but she answered: â\\x80\\x98How\\ndare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\\neverything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\\nupon our name!â\\x80\\x99 Again I didnâ\\x80\\x99t hear what he said, but she went on:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\\nclearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\\npublicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.â\\x80\\x99 Then I\\nthought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure it was Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s voice you heard?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, sir, whose elseâ\\x80\\x99s could it be?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what happened next?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLater, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five oâ\\x80\\x99clock,\\nMrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\\nteaâ\\x80\\x94nothing to eatâ\\x80\\x94to the boudoir. She was looking dreadfulâ\\x80\\x94so white\\nand upset. â\\x80\\x98Dorcas,â\\x80\\x99 she says, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a great shock.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for\\nthat, mâ\\x80\\x99m,â\\x80\\x99 I says. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\\nmâ\\x80\\x99m.â\\x80\\x99 She had something in her hand. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if it was a letter,\\nor just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\\nstaring at it, almost as if she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe what was written\\nthere. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\\nthere: â\\x80\\x98These few wordsâ\\x80\\x94and everythingâ\\x80\\x99s changed.â\\x80\\x99 And then she says to\\nme: â\\x80\\x98Never trust a man, Dorcas, theyâ\\x80\\x99re not worth it!â\\x80\\x99 I hurried off,\\nand got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\\nsheâ\\x80\\x99d feel better when sheâ\\x80\\x99d drunk it. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do,â\\x80\\x99 she\\nsays. â\\x80\\x98Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99d rather hush it up if I could.â\\x80\\x99 Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\\nshe didnâ\\x80\\x99t say any more.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat would she be likely to do with it afterwards?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\\ncase of hers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs that where she usually kept important papers?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\\nevery night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did she lose the key of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\\ncarefully for it. She was very much put out about it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut she had a duplicate key?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\\nI. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\\nthat was lost?â\\x80\\x9d He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\\nthe lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\\n\\nDorcasâ\\x80\\x99s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\\neverywhere for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\\nto-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\\ndress in her wardrobe?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you quite sure?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas anyone else in the house got a green dress?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas reflected.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Cynthia has a green evening dress.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLight or dark green?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sirâ\\x80\\x94not that I know of.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\\notherwise. He merely remarked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\\nthat your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot _last_ night, sir, I know she didnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you know so positively?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t have any more made up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are quite sure of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPositive, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didnâ\\x80\\x99t ask you to\\nsign any paper yesterday?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo sign a paper? No, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\\nfound your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\\nidea to whom these letters were addressed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\\ncould tell you, though sheâ\\x80\\x99s a careless girl. Never cleared the\\ncoffee-cups away last night. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what happens when Iâ\\x80\\x99m not here to\\nlook after things.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot lifted his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSince they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\\nyou. I should like to examine them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat time did you go out last evening?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout six oâ\\x80\\x99clock, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.â\\x80\\x9d He rose and\\nstrolled to the window. â\\x80\\x9cI have been admiring these flower beds. How\\nmany gardeners are employed here, by the way?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\\na gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\\nA fair sight it was. But now thereâ\\x80\\x99s only old Manning, and young\\nWilliam, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\\nAh, these are dreadful times!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\\nwill you send Annie to me here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. Thank you, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?â\\x80\\x9d I asked,\\nin lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. â\\x80\\x9cAnd about the lost key\\nand the duplicate?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.â\\x80\\x9d He\\nsuddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\\npowders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did you find it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom. It was Number\\nSix of my catalogue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\\nmuch importance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cProbably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\\nabout this box?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI examined it closely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say that I do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook at the label.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI read the label carefully: â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\\nrequired. Mrs. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x99 No, I see nothing unusual.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the fact that there is no chemistâ\\x80\\x99s name?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed. â\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, that is odd!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\\nprinted name?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say that I have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\\nfriend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAn audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\\nto reply.\\n\\nAnnie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\\nintense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nPoirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\\nsomething about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\\nwere there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnnie considered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\\nMr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I remember,\\nsirâ\\x80\\x94oh, yes, one was to Rossâ\\x80\\x99s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\\none, I donâ\\x80\\x99t remember.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThink,â\\x80\\x9d urged Poirot.\\n\\nAnnie racked her brains in vain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sorry, sir, but itâ\\x80\\x99s clean gone. I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I can have noticed\\nit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt does not matter,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\\ndisappointment. â\\x80\\x9cNow I want to ask you about something else. There is a\\nsaucepan in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\\nthat every night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\\nin the nightâ\\x80\\x94whenever she fancied it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was it? Plain cocoa?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\\nteaspoonfuls of rum in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho took it to her room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlways?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt what time?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, you see thereâ\\x80\\x99s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\\nto make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\\nused to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\\ntake it into her room later.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe swing door is in the left wing, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\\nfartherâ\\x80\\x94servantsâ\\x80\\x99 side?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s this side, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat time did you bring it up last night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I went to shut up, sir. About eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\\nup to bed before Iâ\\x80\\x99d finished.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, between seven-fifteen and eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the cocoa was standing\\non the table in the left wing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\\nnow she blurted out unexpectedly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t me. I never took the\\nsalt near it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat makes you think there was salt in it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeeing it on the tray, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw some salt on the tray?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\\nthe tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistressâ\\x80\\x99s room I saw\\nit at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\\nasked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\\nout, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\\nhad only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\\nit in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\\nherself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\\nshe would have gaped if she had realized that her â\\x80\\x9ccoarse kitchen saltâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwas strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\\nmarvelled at Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\\nhis next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you went into Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, was the door leading into\\nMiss Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room bolted?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the door into Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room? Did you notice if that was\\nbolted too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnnie hesitated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t say whether it\\nwas bolted or not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\\nafter you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\\nat night. The door into the passage, that is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\\nyesterday?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCandle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didnâ\\x80\\x99t have a candle, only\\na reading-lamp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\\nyou think you would have been sure to have seen it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\\nand a hot iron.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThen Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid your mistress ever have a green dress?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor a mantle, nor a cape, nor aâ\\x80\\x94how do you call it?â\\x80\\x94a sports coat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot green, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor anyone else in the house?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnnie reflected.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\\nMy pent-up excitement burst forth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, â\\x80\\x9cI congratulate you! This is a great discovery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is a great discovery?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\\nexplains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\\nmorning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you think that the cocoaâ\\x80\\x94mark well what I say, Hastings, the\\n_cocoa_â\\x80\\x94contained strychnine?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might have been salt,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot placidly.\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\\nit was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\\nfirst time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\\nit lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\\ntype of mind.\\n\\nPoirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said coldly, â\\x80\\x9cit is not for me to dictate to you.\\nYou have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA most admirable sentiment,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\\nfeet. â\\x80\\x9cNow I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\\nsmaller desk in the corner?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d He tried the roll top tentatively. â\\x80\\x9cLocked. But perhaps one of\\nMrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s keys would open it.â\\x80\\x9d He tried several, twisting and\\nturning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\\nof satisfaction. â\\x80\\x9c_VoilÃ\\xa0!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\\npinch.â\\x80\\x9d He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\\nfiled papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\\napprovingly as he relocked the desk: â\\x80\\x9cDecidedly, he is a man of method,\\nthis Mr. Inglethorp!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA â\\x80\\x9cman of methodâ\\x80\\x9d was, in Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s estimation, the highest praise that\\ncould be bestowed on any individual.\\n\\nI felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\\ndisconnectedly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\\nami?_ There might have been? Yesâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94his eyes wandered round the\\nroomâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthis boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\\nOnly this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\\nme. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\\nenvelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\\nfollowing is a facsimile of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       04\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. â\\x80\\x9cIT ISNâ\\x80\\x99T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did you find this?â\\x80\\x9d I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s. But what does it mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot sayâ\\x80\\x94but it is suggestive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\\npossession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\\nmight have taken her own life?\\n\\nI was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\\ndistracted me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cnow to examine the coffee-cups!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\\nabout the cocoa?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, _lÃ\\xa0 lÃ\\xa0!_ That miserable cocoa!â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot flippantly.\\n\\nHe laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\\ndespair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, anyway,â\\x80\\x9d I said, with increasing coldness, â\\x80\\x9cas Mrs. Inglethorp\\ntook her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\\nfind, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\\nstrychnine on the coffee tray!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot was sobered at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d he said, slipping his arms through mine. â\\x80\\x9c_Ne\\nvous fÃ¢chez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\\nwill respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\\ntogether to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\\nundisturbed as we had left them.\\n\\nPoirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\\nvery carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Mrs. Cavendish stood by the trayâ\\x80\\x94and poured out. Yes. Then she came\\nacross to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\\nare the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\\nwould be Mr. Lawrence Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s. And the one on the tray?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s. I saw him put it down there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood. One, two, three, four, fiveâ\\x80\\x94but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\\nInglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe does not take coffee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\\nsealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\\nso. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\\nthere that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Bien!_â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cIt is evident! I had an ideaâ\\x80\\x94but clearly I\\nwas mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\\nmatter!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\\nworrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\\nthat this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\\nalley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\\nhad been a great man in his day.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBreakfast is ready,â\\x80\\x9d said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\\nhis normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\\nhim temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\\nHe was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\\nbrother, who had, perhaps, too much.\\n\\nEver since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\\nsending telegramsâ\\x80\\x94one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howardâ\\x80\\x94writing\\nnotices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\\nmelancholy duties that a death entails.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMay I ask how things are proceeding?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cDo your investigations\\npoint to my mother having died a natural deathâ\\x80\\x94orâ\\x80\\x94or must we prepare\\nourselves for the worst?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think, Mr. Cavendish,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot gravely, â\\x80\\x9cthat you would do well\\nnot to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\\nof the other members of the family?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\\nnothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\\nheart failure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe does, does he? That is very interestingâ\\x80\\x94very interesting,â\\x80\\x9d murmured\\nPoirot softly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Mrs. Cavendish?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA faint cloud passed over Johnâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not the least idea what my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s views on the subject are.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\\nrather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI told you, didnâ\\x80\\x99t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot bent his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\\nas usualâ\\x80\\x94but, hang it all, oneâ\\x80\\x99s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\\nwith a possible murderer!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\\nCavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\nreason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\\nforgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgottenâ\\x80\\x94that\\nhe did not take it after all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\\nhall drawer. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go and see if itâ\\x80\\x99s there now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\\nfind it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\\nreplace it by now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut do you thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\\nreturn, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\\nfavour. That is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn looked perplexed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not worry,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot smoothly. â\\x80\\x9cI assure you that you need not\\nlet it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\\nbreakfast.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEveryone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\\nwere naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\\nalways trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\\ngood breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\\nusual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\\na matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\\nsecretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\\nDorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\\ntragedy.\\n\\nI pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\\nmanner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\\nwe suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\\nfact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\\nor was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\\nsuspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\\nman.\\n\\nBut did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\\nas she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\\nher soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\\nslender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\\nface could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\\nhardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\\ngreat strength of her personality was dominating us all.\\n\\nAnd little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\\nthought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\\nasked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got the most beastly headache.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot solicitously.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de tÃªte_.â\\x80\\x9d He\\njumped up and took her cup.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo sugar,â\\x80\\x9d said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\\nsugar-tongs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I never take it in coffee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_SacrÃ©!_â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\\nreplenished cup.\\n\\nOnly I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\\nthat his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\\nas green as a catâ\\x80\\x99s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\\nhim stronglyâ\\x80\\x94but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\\nbut I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\\nattention.\\n\\nIn another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Wells to see you, sir,â\\x80\\x9d she said to John.\\n\\nI remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\\nInglethorp had written the night before.\\n\\nJohn rose immediately.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShow him into my study.â\\x80\\x9d Then he turned to us. â\\x80\\x9cMy motherâ\\x80\\x99s lawyer,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe explained. And in a lower voice: â\\x80\\x9cHe is also Coronerâ\\x80\\x94you understand.\\nPerhaps you would like to come with me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\\nand I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere will be an inquest then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\\nmy curiosity was aroused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it? You are not attending to what I say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true, my friend. I am much worried.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat? You cannot be serious?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\\nunderstand. My instinct was right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat instinct?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\\n_Chut!_ no more now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\\n\\nMr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\\ntypical lawyerâ\\x80\\x99s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\\nreason of our presence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will understand, Wells,â\\x80\\x9d he added, â\\x80\\x9cthat this is all strictly\\nprivate. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\\ninvestigation of any kind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite so, quite so,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Wells soothingly. â\\x80\\x9cI wish we could have\\nspared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nquite unavoidable in the absence of a doctorâ\\x80\\x99s certificate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I suppose so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cClever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed,â\\x80\\x9d said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\\nadded rather hesitatingly: â\\x80\\x9cShall we have to appear as witnessesâ\\x80\\x94all of\\nus, I mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou, of courseâ\\x80\\x94and ahâ\\x80\\x94erâ\\x80\\x94Mr.â\\x80\\x94erâ\\x80\\x94Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAny other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\\nform.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA faint expression of relief swept over Johnâ\\x80\\x99s face. It puzzled me, for\\nI saw no occasion for it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you know of nothing to the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d pursued Mr. Wells, â\\x80\\x9cI had\\nthought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s\\nreport. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen that arrangement will suit you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerfectly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\\nmost tragic affair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d interposed Poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\\nhave received the letter this morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\\nto call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\\ngreat importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately, no.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a pity,â\\x80\\x9d said John.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA great pity,â\\x80\\x9d agreed Poirot gravely.\\n\\nThere was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\\nFinally he turned to the lawyer again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask youâ\\x80\\x94that is, if it\\nis not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s death, who would inherit her money?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\\ndoes not objectâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all,â\\x80\\x9d interpolated John.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\\nlast will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\\nlegacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\\nMr. John Cavendish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas not thatâ\\x80\\x94pardon the question, Mr. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x94rather unfair to her\\nother stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwill, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\\nleft her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\\nup Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\\nthat will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Wells bowed his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\\nand void.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Hein!_â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: â\\x80\\x9cWas\\nMrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not know. She may have been.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe was,â\\x80\\x9d said John unexpectedly. â\\x80\\x9cWe were discussing the matter of\\nwills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say â\\x80\\x98her last will.â\\x80\\x99 Had Mrs.\\nInglethorp, then, made several former wills?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn an average, she made a new will at least once a year,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr.\\nWells imperturbably. â\\x80\\x9cShe was given to changing her mind as to her\\ntestamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\\nher family.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuppose,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cthat, unknown to you, she had made a new\\nwill in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\\nmember of the familyâ\\x80\\x94we will say Miss Howard, for instanceâ\\x80\\x94would you be\\nsurprised?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in the least.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\\n\\nI drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\\nquestion of going through Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s papers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\\nHoward?â\\x80\\x9d I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why did you ask?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\\nmotherâ\\x80\\x99s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\\nto Mr. Wells and myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich simplifies matters very much,â\\x80\\x9d murmured the lawyer. â\\x80\\x9cAs\\ntechnically, of course, he was entitledâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He did not finish the\\nsentence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe will look through the desk in the boudoir first,â\\x80\\x9d explained John,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\\npapers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\\ncarefully.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said the lawyer, â\\x80\\x9cit is quite possible that there may be a later\\nwill than the one in my possession.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere _is_ a later will.â\\x80\\x9d It was Poirot who spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr, rather,â\\x80\\x9d pursued my friend imperturbably, â\\x80\\x9cthere _was_ one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you meanâ\\x80\\x94there was one? Where is it now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBurnt!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBurnt?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. See here.â\\x80\\x9d He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\\ngrate in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\\nbrief explanation of when and where he had found it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut possibly this is an old will?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\\nearlier than yesterday afternoon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d broke simultaneously from both men.\\n\\nPoirot turned to John.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of courseâ\\x80\\x94but I donâ\\x80\\x99t seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot raised his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well.â\\x80\\x9d He rang the bell.\\n\\nDorcas answered it in due course.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas withdrew.\\n\\nWe waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\\nease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\\n\\nThe clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\\napproach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\\nnodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome inside, Manning,â\\x80\\x9d said John, â\\x80\\x9cI want to speak to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nManning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\\nstood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\\nvery carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\\nprobably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\\nintelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cManning,â\\x80\\x9d said John, â\\x80\\x9cthis gentleman will put some questions to you\\nwhich I want you to answer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYessir,â\\x80\\x9d mumbled Manning.\\n\\nPoirot stepped forward briskly. Manningâ\\x80\\x99s eye swept over him with a\\nfaint contempt.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\\nhouse yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, me and Willum.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, she did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\\ndown to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-likeâ\\x80\\x94I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t know what exactlyâ\\x80\\x94she wrote it down for him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he did, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what happened next?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe went on with the begonias, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\\npaperâ\\x80\\x94under where sheâ\\x80\\x99d signed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you see anything of what was written above her signature?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\nPoirot sharply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you signed where she told you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, first me and then Willum.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did she do with it afterwards?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\\nsort of purple box that was standing on the desk.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat time was it when she first called you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout four, I should say, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot earlier? Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t it have been about half-past three?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\\nfourâ\\x80\\x94not before it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Manning, that will do,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot pleasantly.\\n\\nThe gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\\nlifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\\ncautiously out of the window.\\n\\nWe all looked at each other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d murmured John. â\\x80\\x9cWhat an extraordinary coincidence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHowâ\\x80\\x94a coincidence?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel withâ\\x80\\x94someone yesterday\\nafternoonâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\\nand he had gone very pale.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\\nhurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\\nknow. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\\nwould have consulted me on the subjectâ\\x80\\x94but she had no chance. The will\\ndisappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\\nI much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\\nyou agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSuggestive, or not,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted John, â\\x80\\x9cwe are most grateful to\\nMonsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\\nnever have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\\nwhat first led you to suspect the fact?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot smiled and answered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\\nmoment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\\nwindow as it swept past.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvie!â\\x80\\x9d cried John. â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, Wells.â\\x80\\x9d He went hurriedly out into the\\nhall.\\n\\nPoirot looked inquiringly at me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard,â\\x80\\x9d I explained.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\\ntoo, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI followed Johnâ\\x80\\x99s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\\nHoward was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\\nof veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\\nof guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\\nearnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\\nand how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\\nhad been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\\nhad known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\\nhad remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\\nthe man have feared her watchful eyes?\\n\\nI was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\\npainful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\\nthat she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\\neyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStarted the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\\ncar. Quickest way to get here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?â\\x80\\x9d asked John.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought not. Come along, breakfastâ\\x80\\x99s not cleared away yet, and\\ntheyâ\\x80\\x99ll make you some fresh tea.â\\x80\\x9d He turned to me. â\\x80\\x9cLook after her,\\nHastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, hereâ\\x80\\x99s Monsieur\\nPoirot. Heâ\\x80\\x99s helping us, you know, Evie.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\\nshoulder at John.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you meanâ\\x80\\x94helping us?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHelping us to investigate.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTaken who to prison?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\\ndied from heart seizure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMore fool, Lawrence!â\\x80\\x9d retorted Miss Howard. â\\x80\\x9cOf course Alfred\\nInglethorp murdered poor Emilyâ\\x80\\x94as I always told you he would.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Evie, donâ\\x80\\x99t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\\nbetter to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nuntil Friday.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot until fiddlesticks!â\\x80\\x9d The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\\nmagnificent. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\\ncountry by then. If heâ\\x80\\x99s any sense, he wonâ\\x80\\x99t stay here tamely and wait\\nto be hanged.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know what it is,â\\x80\\x9d she accused him, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve been listening to the\\ndoctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at allâ\\x80\\x94or just enough\\nto make them dangerous. I ought to knowâ\\x80\\x94my own father was a doctor.\\nThat little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\\nseen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\\ncould see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said heâ\\x80\\x99d\\nmurder her in her bed, poor soul. Now heâ\\x80\\x99s done it. And all you can do\\nis to murmur silly things about â\\x80\\x98heart seizureâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98inquest on\\nFriday.â\\x80\\x99 You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want me to do?â\\x80\\x9d asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDash it all, Evie, I canâ\\x80\\x99t haul him down to the local police station\\nby the scruff of his neck.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, you might do something. Find out how he did it. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a crafty\\nbeggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if sheâ\\x80\\x99s missed any.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\\nHoward and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\\nbetween them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\\nJohn. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\\nappreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\\nrefuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\\n\\nDorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\\nfrom the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\\nHoward.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMademoiselle,â\\x80\\x9d he said gravely, â\\x80\\x9cI want to ask you something.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAsk away,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to be able to count upon your help.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,â\\x80\\x9d she replied gruffly.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHangingâ\\x80\\x99s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\\ngood old times.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are at one then,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cfor I, too, want to hang the\\ncriminal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlfred Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHim, or another.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\\nalong. I donâ\\x80\\x99t say she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t surrounded by sharksâ\\x80\\x94she was. But it was\\nonly her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\\ncomes Mr. Alfred Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x94and within two monthsâ\\x80\\x94hey presto!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBelieve me, Miss Howard,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot very earnestly, â\\x80\\x9cif Mr.\\nInglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\\nhang him as high as Haman!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s better,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\\nme. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\\nare the only eyes that have wept.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\\nvoice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you mean that I was fond of herâ\\x80\\x94yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\\nselfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\\nwanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\\nthemâ\\x80\\x94and, that way she missed love. Donâ\\x80\\x99t think she ever realized it,\\nthough, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\\nfooting. I took my stand from the first. â\\x80\\x98So many pounds a year Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nworth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besidesâ\\x80\\x94not a pair\\nof gloves, nor a theatre ticket.â\\x80\\x99 She didnâ\\x80\\x99t understandâ\\x80\\x94was very\\noffended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t thatâ\\x80\\x94but I\\ncouldnâ\\x80\\x99t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\\nwhole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\\nher. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\\nglib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\\ngo for nothing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded sympathetically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\\nnatural. You think that we are lukewarmâ\\x80\\x94that we lack fire and\\nenergyâ\\x80\\x94but trust me, it is not so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\\nto Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\\nthrough the desk in the boudoir.\\n\\nAs we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\\nlowered his voice confidentially:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here, whatâ\\x80\\x99s going to happen when these two meet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head helplessly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill she be able to do so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Lord only knows. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s one thing, Inglethorp himself wonâ\\x80\\x99t be\\ntoo keen on meeting her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve got the keys still, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you, Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, as we\\nreached the door of the locked room.\\n\\nTaking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\\nThe lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\\nbelieve,â\\x80\\x9d he said.\\n\\nPoirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPermit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s not locked now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee.â\\x80\\x9d And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Milles tonnerres!_â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot, dumbfounded. â\\x80\\x9cAnd Iâ\\x80\\x94who have both\\nthe keys in my pocket!â\\x80\\x9d He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\\nstiffened. â\\x80\\x9c_Eh voilÃ\\xa0 une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot laid down the case again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?â\\x80\\x9d\\nThese exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\\n\\nPoirot answered them categoricallyâ\\x80\\x94almost mechanically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\\nhere an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\\nlock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\\nmantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\\nlong force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\\nthe mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee here, it was like this,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cThere was something in\\nthat caseâ\\x80\\x94some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\\nenough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\\nto him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\\nsignificance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\\nof coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\\nthus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\\nbeen something of great importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what was it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. â\\x80\\x9cThat, I do not know! A\\ndocument of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\\nDorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d his anger burst\\nforth freelyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cmiserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\\nbehaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\\nshould have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\\ngone. It is destroyedâ\\x80\\x94but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chanceâ\\x80\\x94we\\nmust leave no stone unturnedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\\nhad sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\\ntop of the stairs, he was out of sight.\\n\\nMary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\\ninto the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\\nHe has just rushed past me like a mad bull.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s rather upset about something,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked feebly. I really did\\nnot know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\\nsmile gather on Mrs. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\\nand turn the conversation by saying: â\\x80\\x9cThey havenâ\\x80\\x99t met yet, have they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d I said, rather taken aback.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d She was smiling in her quiet way. â\\x80\\x9cI should like to see a good\\nflare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\\nmuch, and saying so little.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn doesnâ\\x80\\x99t think so,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s anxious to keep them apart.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, John!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSomething in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOld Johnâ\\x80\\x99s an awfully good sort.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\\ngreat surprise:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArenâ\\x80\\x99t you my friend too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am a very bad friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy do you say that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\\nall about them the next.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\\nand not in the best of taste:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInstantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\\nimpression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\\nwoman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\\nwhilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\\n\\nI was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\\ncould hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\\ndiplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\\nwhole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\\ndoubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\\nfriend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\\nstepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\\nimmediately. I drew him aside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cis this wise? Surely you donâ\\x80\\x99t want the\\nwhole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\\nthe criminalâ\\x80\\x99s hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think so, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\\nstill thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last, â\\x80\\x9clet us go, _mon ami_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have finished here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWillingly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\\nwindow in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\\nPoirot stood aside to let her pass.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d she turned inquiringly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s medicines?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly her powders?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\\n\\nShe nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, they were bromide powders.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\\nonce. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\\neyes turned green like a catâ\\x80\\x99s. They were shining like emeralds now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friend,â\\x80\\x9d he broke out at last, â\\x80\\x9cI have a little idea, a very\\nstrange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yetâ\\x80\\x94it fits in.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\\nmuch given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\\nwas only too plain and apparent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\\nmyself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot did not appear to be listening to me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey have made one more discovery, _lÃ\\xa0-bas_,â\\x80\\x9d he observed, jerking his\\nthumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Wells told me\\nas we were going upstairs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLocked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\\nInglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\\nIt came quite as a surprise to Wellsâ\\x80\\x94and to John Cavendish also. It was\\nwritten on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\\nservantsâ\\x80\\x94not Dorcas.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid Mr. Inglethorp know of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe says not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne might take that with a grain of salt,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked sceptically.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\\nwords on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\\nyesterday afternoon?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\\nfact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, often. I suppose everyone has.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\\ntwice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\\nsee if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\\nwill notice that the word â\\x80\\x98possessedâ\\x80\\x99 is spelt first with one â\\x80\\x98sâ\\x80\\x99 and\\nsubsequently with twoâ\\x80\\x94correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\\nin a sentence, thus: â\\x80\\x98I am possessed.â\\x80\\x99 Now, what did that tell me? It\\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word â\\x80\\x98possessedâ\\x80\\x99 that\\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\\nin my mind, the possibility of a willâ\\x80\\x94(a document almost certain to\\ncontain that word)â\\x80\\x94occurred to me at once. This possibility was\\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\\ndeposit.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\\nbeen newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\\non the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\\nbeen planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\\nboth of the gardenersâ\\x80\\x94for there were two sets of footprints in the\\nbedâ\\x80\\x94had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\\nto speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\\nand they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\\nconvinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\\ngardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\\nin my supposition.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was very ingenious,â\\x80\\x9d I could not help admitting. â\\x80\\x9cI must confess\\nthat the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\\nerroneous.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\\nservant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\\nlikely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnother pointâ\\x80\\x94how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\\nbeen lost?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\\nobserved that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\\nsuggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\\nkey-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\\nat once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\\nwas obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\\nthe hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\\nlock of the despatch-case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cAlfred Inglethorp, without doubt.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot looked at me curiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very sure of his guilt?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\\nclearly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot quietly, â\\x80\\x9cthere are several points in\\nhis favour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see only one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat he was not in the house last night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Bad shot!â\\x80\\x99 as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\\nmy mind tells against him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow is that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\\nnight, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\\nexcuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\\npossibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\\nreason of his own for his absence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that reason?â\\x80\\x9d I asked sceptically.\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\\nI should say, is somewhat of a scoundrelâ\\x80\\x94but that does not of necessity\\nmake him a murderer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head, unconvinced.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe do not agree, eh?â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cWell, let us leave it. Time will\\nshow which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\\ncase. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\\nwere bolted on the inside?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWellâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d I considered. â\\x80\\x9cOne must look at it logically.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTrue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should put it this way. The doors _were_ boltedâ\\x80\\x94our own eyes have\\ntold us thatâ\\x80\\x94yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\\nthe destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\\nentered the room. You agree so far?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, encouraged, â\\x80\\x9cas the person who entered did not do so by\\nthe window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\\nbeen opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\\nthe conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\\nnaturally open the door to her own husband.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should she? She had bolted the door leading into his roomâ\\x80\\x94a most\\nunusual proceeding on her partâ\\x80\\x94she had had a most violent quarrel with\\nhim that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\\nInglethorp herself?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\\ninto the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\\nmorning, and bolted it then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot, is that seriously your opinion?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\\nfeature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\\nbetween Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had forgotten that,â\\x80\\x9d I said thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cThat is as enigmatical as\\never. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\\nreticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\\ncertainly not her affair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\\ndo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is certainly curious,â\\x80\\x9d I agreed. â\\x80\\x9cStill, it is unimportant, and\\nneed not be taken into account.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA groan burst from Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\\nthe fact will not fit the theoryâ\\x80\\x94let the theory go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, we shall see,â\\x80\\x9d I said, nettled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, we shall see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\\nown room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\\noccasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\\nused matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\\nannoyance vanished.\\n\\nPoirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\\ncommanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\\npleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\\n\\nSuddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\\ndown the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\\nwas extraordinaryâ\\x80\\x94a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook, Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\n\\nHe leant forward.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Tiens!_â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt is Mr. Mace, from the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop. He is\\ncoming here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\\nhesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA little minute,â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot from the window. â\\x80\\x9cI come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMotioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\\nopened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Poirot, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99d just come back from the Hall?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, we have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\\nThey do sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he lowered his voice cautiouslyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat itâ\\x80\\x99s poison?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s face remained quite impassive.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, exactlyâ\\x80\\x94of courseâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d The young man hesitated, and then his\\nagitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\\nhis voice to a whisper: â\\x80\\x9cJust tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isnâ\\x80\\x99tâ\\x80\\x94it\\nisnâ\\x80\\x99t strychnine, is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\\nnon-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s eyes met mine.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he said, nodding gravely. â\\x80\\x9cHe will have evidence to give at the\\ninquest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\\nstopped me with a gesture of his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\\nsome disorderâ\\x80\\x94which is not well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\\nfor several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\\neyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\\nclassified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\\nyetâ\\x80\\x94no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\\nHercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what are they?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\\nimportant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it was a glorious day!â\\x80\\x9d I interrupted. â\\x80\\x9cPoirot, youâ\\x80\\x99re pulling my\\nleg!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\\nforget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the second point?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\\nclothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot, I cannot believe you are serious.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am absolutely serious, my friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut this is childish!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it is very momentous.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd supposing the Coronerâ\\x80\\x99s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\\nagainst Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\\nmake a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\\nis not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\\nstands practically in the position of local squire. Also,â\\x80\\x9d he added\\nplacidly, â\\x80\\x9c_I_ should not allow it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_You_ would not allow it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\\namusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\\nthoughts, he nodded gently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.â\\x80\\x9d He got up and laid his\\nhand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\\ncame into his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cIn all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\\nInglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly lovedâ\\x80\\x94no. But she was\\nvery good to us Belgiansâ\\x80\\x94I owe her a debt.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\\nAlfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_â\\x80\\x94when a word from me\\ncould save him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. THE INQUEST\\n\\nIn the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\\nactivity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\\ninto the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\\nconfidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikesâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfarm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\\nWednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\\nhim. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\\nthe farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\\nme cunningly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99m from the Hall, bainâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Iâ\\x80\\x99m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\\nthis way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\\nfrom the village?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I said eagerly. â\\x80\\x9cHe has been here, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay, heâ\\x80\\x99s been here, right enough. Moreâ\\x80\\x99n once too. Friend of\\nyours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hallâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99m a pretty lot!â\\x80\\x9d And\\nhe leered more jocosely than ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, as\\ncarelessly as I could.\\n\\nHe winked at me knowingly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\\ngentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\\nexperienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s liberality with another womanâ\\x80\\x99s money. Had that piquant\\ngipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\\nmainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\\n\\nOn one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\\ntwice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\\nfixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\\nwas four-thirty, and not four oâ\\x80\\x99clock when she had heard the voices.\\n\\nBut Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\\nbetween the time when she had heard the voices and five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, when\\nshe had taken tea to her mistress.\\n\\nThe inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\\nPoirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\\n\\nThe preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\\nCavendish gave evidence of identification.\\n\\nFurther questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\\nthe morning, and the circumstances of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s death.\\n\\nThe medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\\nevery eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\\nbe one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\\ntoxicology.\\n\\nIn a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\\nof its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\\npoisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\\nless than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\\ngrain or slightly over.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?â\\x80\\x9d\\nasked the Coroner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\\ndomestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\\nplaced on its sale.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\\nwas administered?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\\nhurried there as fast as I could.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you relate to us exactly what happened next?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI entered Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room. She was at that moment in a typical\\ntetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Alfredâ\\x80\\x94Alfredâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCould the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\nafter-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPossibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\\nsymptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\\nis retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\\nhave been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\\ncoffee after dinner about eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, whereas the symptoms did not\\nmanifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\\nface of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\\nevening.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\\nmiddle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\\nhad it analysed. There was no strychnine present.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you know?â\\x80\\x9d I whispered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cListen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should sayâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94the doctor was continuingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat I would have been\\nconsiderably surprised at any other result.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSimply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\\ndetected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\\ndisguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\\npowerless to mask it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOne of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\\nthe taste of strychnine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\\ncoffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\\nanalyzing its contents.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis concluded Dr. Bauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\\non all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\\nit utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\\notherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\\nwell-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\\nher own life.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\\nbeing a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\\nstep down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should like to make a suggestion if I may?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\\nmatter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is just an idea of mine,â\\x80\\x9d explained Lawrence. â\\x80\\x9cOf course I may be\\nquite wrong, but it still seems to me that my motherâ\\x80\\x99s death might be\\naccounted for by natural means.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\\ntaking a tonic containing strychnine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said the Coroner.\\n\\nThe jury looked up, interested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe,â\\x80\\x9d continued Lawrence, â\\x80\\x9cthat there have been cases where the\\ncumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\\ncausing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\\noverdose of her medicine by accident?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\\nthe time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\\nyou the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\\nbut it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\\nthis way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\\nwhich would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\\nabsurd.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\\ntaken an overdose?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThree, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\\nInglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\\ntime, as she dealt with Cootâ\\x80\\x99s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\\nwould have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\\namount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\\nway instrumental in causing her death?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. The supposition is ridiculous.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\\nchemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat, of course, is always possible,â\\x80\\x9d replied the doctor.\\n\\nBut Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\\npossibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\\nMrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\\n\\nSo the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\\nproceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\\nawakened by the violent ringing of her mistressâ\\x80\\x99s bell, and had\\nsubsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\\nquarrel on the preceding afternoon.\\n\\nDorcasâ\\x80\\x99s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\\nalready heard, so I will not repeat it here.\\n\\nThe next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\\nin a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\\nCoronerâ\\x80\\x99s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\\nfour-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\\nsound of something heavy falling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat would have been the table by the bed?â\\x80\\x9d commented the Coroner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI opened my door,â\\x80\\x9d continued Mary, â\\x80\\x9cand listened. In a few minutes a\\nbell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\\nwe all went to my mother-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s room, but it was lockedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\\nknow all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\\nbe obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\\nday before.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\\nadjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\\nshe did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is gaining time!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I understand,â\\x80\\x9d continued the Coroner deliberately, â\\x80\\x9cthat you were\\nsitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\\nboudoir. That is so, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\\nwas news to him as well.\\n\\nThere was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\\nshe answered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that is so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the boudoir window was open, was it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSurely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\\nthey were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\\nyou were than in the hall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPossibly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really do not remember hearing anything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to say you did not hear voices?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.â\\x80\\x9d A\\nfaint spot of colour came into her cheek. â\\x80\\x9cI am not in the habit of\\nlistening to private conversations.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner persisted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\\nstray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\\nconversation?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said somethingâ\\x80\\x94I do not remember\\nexactly whatâ\\x80\\x94about causing scandal between husband and wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d the Coroner leant back satisfied. â\\x80\\x9cThat corresponds with what\\nDorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\\nwas a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\\nyou were?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\\nfelt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\\nlittle lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\\nquietly enough:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that is all you can tell us?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\\nsatisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\\nmore if she chose.\\n\\nAmy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\\nwill form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\\nat Styles.\\n\\nWilliam Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\\ndocument. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\\nthe opinion that it was rather earlier.\\n\\nCynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\\nknown nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did not hear the table fall?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. I was fast asleep.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA good conscience makes a sound sleeper,â\\x80\\x9d he observed. â\\x80\\x9cThank you,\\nMiss Murdoch, that is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\\nthe evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\\nIt added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\\nfacsimile:\\n\\nSTYLES COURT\\nESSEX\\nhand written note:\\n\\n     July 17th\\n     My dear Evelyn\\n     Can we not bury\\n     the hachet? I have\\n     found it hard to forgive\\n     the things you said\\n     against my dear husband\\n     but I am an old woman\\n     & very fond of you\\n     Yours affectionately,\\n    Emily Inglethorpe\\n\\n\\nIt was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI fear it does not help us much,â\\x80\\x9d said the Coroner, with a sigh.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlain as a pikestaff to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Howard shortly. â\\x80\\x9cIt shows\\nclearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out sheâ\\x80\\x99d been\\nmade a fool of!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt says nothing of the kind in the letter,â\\x80\\x9d the Coroner pointed out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\\n_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t going to own that Iâ\\x80\\x99d\\nbeen right. She went round about. Most people do. Donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in it\\nmyself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\\nHoward was obviously quite a public character.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,â\\x80\\x9d continued the\\nlady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. â\\x80\\x9cTalkâ\\x80\\x94talkâ\\x80\\x94talk!\\nWhen all the time we know perfectly wellâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you, Miss Howard, that is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\\n\\nThen came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\\nchemistâ\\x80\\x99s assistant.\\n\\nIt was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\\nCoronerâ\\x80\\x99s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\\nbut had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\\nformerly there had just been called up for the army.\\n\\nThese preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen was this?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLast Monday night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMonday? Not Tuesday?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, Monday, the 16th.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWill you tell us to whom you sold it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYou could have heard a pin drop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEvery eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\\nimpassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\\nfrom the young manâ\\x80\\x99s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\\nchair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\\nexpression of astonishment rose on his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are sure of what you say?â\\x80\\x9d asked the Coroner sternly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite sure, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\\ncounter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coronerâ\\x80\\x99s frown.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, sirâ\\x80\\x94of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\\nHall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\\ndog.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Hallâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94especially when it might result in custom being transferred\\nfrom Cootâ\\x80\\x99s to the local establishment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you got the book here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\\ndismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\\n\\nThen, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\\nrealize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\\nneck?\\n\\nThe Coroner went straight to the point.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\\npoisoning a dog?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\\nwhich is in perfect health.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\\nMonday last?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you also deny _this_?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\\ninscribed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\\nshow you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\\nhanding it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen what is your explanation of Mr. Maceâ\\x80\\x99s statement?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Mace must have been mistaken.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\\nwhere you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReallyâ\\x80\\x94I cannot remember.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,â\\x80\\x9d said the Coroner sharply. â\\x80\\x9cThink\\nagain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn what direction?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI really canâ\\x80\\x99t remember.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coronerâ\\x80\\x99s face grew graver.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWere you in company with anyone?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you meet anyone on your walk?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a pity,â\\x80\\x9d said the Coroner dryly. â\\x80\\x9cI am to take it then that\\nyou decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\\nrecognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you like to take it that way, yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe careful, Mr. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot was fidgeting nervously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_SacrÃ©!_â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cDoes this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\\narrested?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\\nwould not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\\nto the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, â\\x80\\x9cyou have been misinformed.\\nI had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\\nuntrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you anyone who can testify to that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have my word,â\\x80\\x9d said Inglethorp haughtily.\\n\\nThe Coroner did not trouble to reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\\ndisagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThose witnesses were mistaken.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\\nstaggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\\nhis face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\\nAlfred Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s guilt?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorp,â\\x80\\x9d said the Coroner, â\\x80\\x9cyou have heard your wifeâ\\x80\\x99s dying\\nwords repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly I can.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\\nis much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\\nlight, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d murmured Poirot to himself. â\\x80\\x9cBut it is an idea, that!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think it is true?â\\x80\\x9d I whispered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou read my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s last words as an accusationâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94Inglethorp was\\ncontinuingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthey were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\\nand took it to your wife that evening?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\\nbut I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\\ncoffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\\nminutes later, it was gone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\\nto improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\\ntime to introduce the poison.\\n\\nAt that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\\nsitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\\nferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\\n\\nI questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know who that little man is?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yardâ\\x80\\x94Jimmy Japp.\\nThe other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\\nfriend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\\npoliceman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\\nofficial personages.\\n\\nI was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\\nbeing given:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\\n\\nAs we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\\npressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\\nScotland Yard men.\\n\\nIn a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\\naccosted the shorter of the two.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t Mr. Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d cried the Inspector. He turned to the\\nother man. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\\nI worked togetherâ\\x80\\x94the Abercrombie forgery caseâ\\x80\\x94you remember, he was run\\ndown in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\\nremember â\\x80\\x98Baronâ\\x80\\x99 Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\\nthe clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\\nAntwerpâ\\x80\\x94thanks to Mr. Poirot here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\\nand was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\\nintroduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d remarked\\nPoirot.\\n\\nJapp closed one eye knowingly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Poirot answered gravely:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere I differ from you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come!â\\x80\\x9d said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The manâ\\x80\\x99s caught\\nred-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHold your fire, Summerhaye,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked jocularly. â\\x80\\x9cMe and Moosier\\nhere have met beforeâ\\x80\\x94and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no manâ\\x80\\x99s judgment Iâ\\x80\\x99d sooner take than\\nhis. If Iâ\\x80\\x99m not greatly mistaken, heâ\\x80\\x99s got something up his sleeve.\\nIsnâ\\x80\\x99t that so, moosier?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have drawn certain conclusionsâ\\x80\\x94yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSummerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\\nscrutiny of Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s this way,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cso far, weâ\\x80\\x99ve only seen the case from the\\noutside. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s where the Yardâ\\x80\\x99s at a disadvantage in a case of this\\nkind, where the murderâ\\x80\\x99s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\\nlot depends on being on the spot first thing, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s where Mr.\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s had the start of us. We shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been here as soon as\\nthis even, if it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\\non the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But youâ\\x80\\x99ve been\\non the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\\nhints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\\nwife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\\nIâ\\x80\\x99d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didnâ\\x80\\x99t bring\\nit in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\\nit hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for the Coronerâ\\x80\\x94he seemed to be holding them back.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\\nnow,â\\x80\\x9d suggested Poirot.\\n\\nA kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Jappâ\\x80\\x99s\\nexpressive countenance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I have, and perhaps I havenâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked dryly.\\n\\nPoirot looked at him thoughtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dare say,â\\x80\\x9d observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\\n\\nJapp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A winkâ\\x80\\x99s as good as a\\nnodâ\\x80\\x94from you. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve been on the spotâ\\x80\\x94and the Yard doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to make\\nany mistakes, you know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\\nwarrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudosâ\\x80\\x94the case\\nagainst him will be dismissed at once! _Comme Ã§a!_â\\x80\\x9d And he snapped his\\nfingers expressively.\\n\\nJappâ\\x80\\x99s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\\n\\nAs for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\\nconclude that Poirot was mad.\\n\\nJapp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI darenâ\\x80\\x99t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_â\\x80\\x99d take your word, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s others\\nover me whoâ\\x80\\x99ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Canâ\\x80\\x99t you give me\\na little more to go on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot reflected a moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt can be done,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last. â\\x80\\x9cI admit I do not wish it. It forces\\nmy hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\\npresent, but what you say is very justâ\\x80\\x94the word of a Belgian policeman,\\nwhose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\\narrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\\nthen, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, in about half an hour. Weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\\nfirst.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood. Call for me in passingâ\\x80\\x94the last house in the village. I will go\\nwith you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refusesâ\\x80\\x94as\\nis probableâ\\x80\\x94I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\\ncase against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a bargain,â\\x80\\x9d said Japp heartily. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, on behalf of the Yard,\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m much obliged to you, though Iâ\\x80\\x99m bound to confess I canâ\\x80\\x99t at present\\nsee the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\\nwere a marvel! So long, then, moosier.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\\nhis face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, â\\x80\\x9cwhat do\\nyou think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\\nfigure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\\nsay anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nremarked. â\\x80\\x9cFor, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\\nhimself except by silence?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, in a thousand ingenious ways,â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cSee; say that it is\\nI who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\\nstories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s stony denials!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could not help laughing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\\nseriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\\nsurely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\ninnocence?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut the evidence is so conclusive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, too conclusive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\\nfamiliar stairs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, too conclusive,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot, almost to himself. â\\x80\\x9cReal\\nevidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\\nexaminedâ\\x80\\x94sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\\nfriend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufacturedâ\\x80\\x94so cleverly\\nthat it has defeated its own ends.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you make that out?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\\nit was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\\ndrawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\\nsets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\\ngoes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\\nfool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\\nchemistâ\\x80\\x99s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\\nup story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\\nemploy the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\\nquarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\\nnaturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defenceâ\\x80\\x94no\\nshadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s assistant must\\nnecessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\\nthat any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\\nsuicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStillâ\\x80\\x94I do not seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d I began.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_â\\x80\\x94Hercule\\nPoirot!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\\nstrychnine?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery simply. He did _not_ buy it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Mace recognized him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\\nMr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\\nman whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\\nremember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\\nInglethorp dealt principally with Cootâ\\x80\\x99s in Tadminster.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you thinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\\nthe first one for the moment, what was the second?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\\na black beard, and uses glasses,â\\x80\\x9d I quoted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\\nLawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I said thoughtfully. â\\x80\\x9cOf course an actorâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\\nare both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\\nin broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\\ninitial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\\nthat is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\\neyesâ\\x80\\x94those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\\nwhat is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\\nhimself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\\nsomeone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\\nEverybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s guilt. It was\\na foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\\nsure thing there must be tangible proofâ\\x80\\x94such as the actual buying of\\nthe poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\\nInglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\\nactually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\\nhis clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\\nInglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt may be so,â\\x80\\x9d I said, fascinated by Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s eloquence. â\\x80\\x9cBut, if that\\nwas the case, why does he not say where he was at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock on Monday\\nevening?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, why indeed?â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, calming down. â\\x80\\x9cIf he were arrested, he\\nprobably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\\nhim see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\\ndiscreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\\nnevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\\nquite apart from the murder.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat can it be?â\\x80\\x9d I mused, won over to Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s views for the moment,\\nalthough still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\\nwas the correct one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan you not guess?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot, smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, can you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I had a little idea sometime agoâ\\x80\\x94and it has turned out to be\\ncorrect.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou never told me,â\\x80\\x9d I said reproachfully.\\n\\nPoirot spread out his hands apologetically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.â\\x80\\x9d He turned\\nto me earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cTell meâ\\x80\\x94you see now that he must not be arrested?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,â\\x80\\x9d I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\\nfate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\\nno harm.\\n\\nPoirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d he said, changing the subject, â\\x80\\x9capart from Mr.\\nInglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, pretty much what I expected.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid nothing strike you as peculiar about it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMy thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn what way?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Lawrence Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s evidence for instance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was relieved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Lawrence! No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. Heâ\\x80\\x99s always a nervous chap.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\\nby means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\\nstrangeâ\\x80\\x94 _hein?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I canâ\\x80\\x99t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\\nquite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\\nhad started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s true. I never thought of that.â\\x80\\x9d I was rather startled. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\n_is_ odd.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\\nhe alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\\npoisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\\nstrenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\\nMonsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\\nknowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x94no!\\nAnd now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\\nknown was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very confusing,â\\x80\\x9d I agreed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen there is Mrs. Cavendish,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s another who\\nis not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\\nshould be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded reflectively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\\nof that â\\x80\\x98private conversationâ\\x80\\x99 than she was willing to admit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\\neavesdrop!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\\nDorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\\nafternoon, about four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, as she said.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\\nthat point.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\\nin the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\\nfact.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has insomnia, I believe,â\\x80\\x9d I said doubtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich is a very good, or a very bad explanation,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\ncovers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\\nclever Dr. Bauerstein.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAny more faults to find with the evidence?â\\x80\\x9d I inquired satirically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot gravely, â\\x80\\x9cwhen you find that people are not\\ntelling you the truthâ\\x80\\x94look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\\ninquest to-day only oneâ\\x80\\x94at most, two persons were speaking the truth\\nwithout reservation or subterfuge.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, come now, Poirot! I wonâ\\x80\\x99t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s Johnâ\\x80\\x94and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBoth of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but bothâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x99s evidence,\\nunimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\\nstraightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\\nsincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s sagacityâ\\x80\\x94except on\\nthe occasions when he was what I described to myself as â\\x80\\x9cfoolishly\\npig-headed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you really think so?â\\x80\\x9d I asked. â\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard had always seemed to me\\nso essentially honestâ\\x80\\x94almost uncomfortably so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\\nseemed to speak, and then checked himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Murdoch too,â\\x80\\x9d I continued, â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing untruthful about\\n_her_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\\ndoor; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\\ndistinctly heard the table fall.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sheâ\\x80\\x99s young. And she sleeps soundly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\\nknock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\\ntwo detectives waiting for us below.\\n\\nPoirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\\ncarefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\\nme to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\\nset out for Styles.\\n\\nI think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\\nshockâ\\x80\\x94especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\\nrealized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\\ndetectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\\nhave done.\\n\\nPoirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\\nthe latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\\nexception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\\ndrawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\\nto make his boast good.\\n\\nPersonally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\\nhis belief in Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s innocence, but a man of the type of\\nSummerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\\ncould supply.\\n\\nBefore very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\\nwhich Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\\nScotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\\nfirst time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\\ntangible reality. We had read of such thingsâ\\x80\\x94now we ourselves were\\nactors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\\nwould blazon out the news in staring headlines:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEXâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cWEALTHY LADY POISONEDâ\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\nThere would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of â\\x80\\x9cThe family leaving\\nthe Inquestâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\\nthat one had read a hundred timesâ\\x80\\x94things that happen to other people,\\nnot to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\\nfront of us were â\\x80\\x9cthe detectives in charge of the case.â\\x80\\x9d The well-known\\nglib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\\nPoirot opened the proceedings.\\n\\nI think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\\none of the official detectives who took the initiative.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\\ncelebrity about to deliver a lecture, â\\x80\\x9cI have asked you to come here\\nall together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\\nInglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInglethorp was sitting a little by himselfâ\\x80\\x94I think, unconsciously,\\neveryone had drawn his chair slightly away from himâ\\x80\\x94and he gave a faint\\nstart as Poirot pronounced his name.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorp,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, addressing him directly, â\\x80\\x9ca very dark\\nshadow is resting on this houseâ\\x80\\x94the shadow of murder.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nInglethorp shook his head sadly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy poor wife,â\\x80\\x9d he murmured. â\\x80\\x9cPoor Emily! It is terrible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think, monsieur,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot pointedly, â\\x80\\x9cthat you quite\\nrealize how terrible it may beâ\\x80\\x94for you.â\\x80\\x9d And as Inglethorp did not\\nappear to understand, he added: â\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\\nvery grave danger.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution â\\x80\\x9cAnything you\\nsay will be used in evidence against you,â\\x80\\x9d actually hovering on\\nSummerhayeâ\\x80\\x99s lips. Poirot went on.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you understand now, monsieur?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. What do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot deliberately, â\\x80\\x9cthat you are suspected of\\npoisoning your wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried Inglethorp, starting up. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a monstrous idea!\\n_I_â\\x80\\x94poison my dearest Emily!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not thinkâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94Poirot watched him narrowlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat you quite realize\\nthe unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\\nInglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\\nsay where you were at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock on Monday afternoon?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\\nhis hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak!â\\x80\\x9d he cried menacingly.\\n\\nWith an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\\nand deliberately, he shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will not speak?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\\nof what you say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Soit!_â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThen I must speak for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou? How can you speak? You do not knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he broke off abruptly.\\n\\nPoirot turned to face us. â\\x80\\x9c_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\\nI, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop,\\nand purchased strychnine at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock on Monday last was not Mr.\\nInglethorp, for at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\\nMrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\\nless than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\\nat six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\\nRaikesâ\\x80\\x99s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\\nvillage. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. FRESH SUSPICIONS\\n\\nThere was a momentâ\\x80\\x99s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\\nsurprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy word,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\\nThese witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_VoilÃ\\xa0!_ I have prepared a list of themâ\\x80\\x94names and addresses. You must\\nsee them, of course. But you will find it all right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure of that.â\\x80\\x9d Japp lowered his voice. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m much obliged to you. A\\npretty mareâ\\x80\\x99s nest arresting him would have been.â\\x80\\x9d He turned to\\nInglethorp. â\\x80\\x9cBut, if youâ\\x80\\x99ll excuse me, sir, why couldnâ\\x80\\x99t you say all\\nthis at the inquest?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will tell you why,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cThere was a certain\\nrumourâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA most malicious and utterly untrue one,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Alfred\\nInglethorp in an agitated voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\\npresent. Am I right?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite right.â\\x80\\x9d Inglethorp nodded. â\\x80\\x9cWith my poor Emily not yet buried,\\ncan you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\\nstarted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetween you and me, sir,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Japp, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d sooner have any amount\\nof rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\\npoor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for Mr.\\nPoirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was foolish, no doubt,â\\x80\\x9d murmured Inglethorp. â\\x80\\x9cBut you do not know,\\ninspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.â\\x80\\x9d And he shot a\\nbaleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, sir,â\\x80\\x9d said Japp, turning briskly to John, â\\x80\\x9cI should like to see\\nthe ladyâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom, please, and after that Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have a little chat with\\nthe servants. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\\nshow me the way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\\nfollow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuick, go to the other wing. Stand thereâ\\x80\\x94just this side of the baize\\ndoor. Do not move till I come.â\\x80\\x9d Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\\ntwo detectives.\\n\\nI followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\\nand wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\\nin this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\\ncorridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\\nCynthia Murdochâ\\x80\\x99s, everyoneâ\\x80\\x99s room was in this left wing. Had that\\nanything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\\nfaithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\\nhappened.\\n\\nIt must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have not stirred?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve stuck here like a rock. Nothingâ\\x80\\x99s happened.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d Was he pleased, or disappointed? â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve seen nothing at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you have probably heard something? A big bumpâ\\x80\\x94eh, _mon ami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\\nclumsy. I made but a slight gestureâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94I know Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s gesturesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cwith the\\nleft hand, and over went the table by the bed!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\\nconsole him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\\nexcited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\\nbe more in this affair of Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s with Mrs. Raikes than we\\nthought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\\ngoing to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\\nam disappointed in Japp. He has no method!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHullo!â\\x80\\x9d I said, looking out of the window. â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s Dr. Bauerstein. I\\nbelieve youâ\\x80\\x99re right about that man, Poirot. I donâ\\x80\\x99t like him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is clever,â\\x80\\x9d observed Poirot meditatively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\\nplight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!â\\x80\\x9d And I\\ndescribed the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s adventure. â\\x80\\x9cHe looked a regular scarecrow!\\nPlastered with mud from head to foot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw him, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Of course, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to come inâ\\x80\\x94it was just after dinnerâ\\x80\\x94but\\nMr. Inglethorp insisted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. â\\x80\\x9cWas Dr.\\nBauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\\ndid you not tell me? Why? Why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I expostulated, â\\x80\\x9cI never thought it would interest\\nyou. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know it was of any importance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImportance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\\non Tuesday nightâ\\x80\\x94the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\\nThat alters everythingâ\\x80\\x94everything!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\\nmechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\\nhimself: â\\x80\\x9cYes, that alters everythingâ\\x80\\x94everything.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Allons!_â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWe must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\\nclue. May I take your motor?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, of course. Do you mean at once?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you please.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\\nwe were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked resignedly, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps you will tell me what\\nall this is about?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\\nrealize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\\ngreatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\\nknow now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\\ncleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\\nascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\\nCavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\\nInglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\\nthat he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\\nthat at the inquestâ\\x80\\x94but now it has a very different significance. We\\nmust find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\\nor who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\\naccount, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\\ngo near the coffeeâ\\x80\\x94Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that is so.â\\x80\\x9d I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\\nMary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn clearing Alfred Inglethorp,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cI have been obliged\\nto show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\\nto be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\\nbe doubly careful. Yesâ\\x80\\x94doubly careful.â\\x80\\x9d He turned to me abruptly. â\\x80\\x9cTell\\nme, Hastings, you yourselfâ\\x80\\x94have you no suspicions of anybody?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\\nitself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\\nrejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou couldnâ\\x80\\x99t call it a suspicion,â\\x80\\x9d I murmured. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s so utterly\\nfoolish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome now,â\\x80\\x9d urged Poirot encouragingly. â\\x80\\x9cDo not fear. Speak your mind.\\nYou should always pay attention to your instincts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell then,â\\x80\\x9d I blurted out, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s absurdâ\\x80\\x94but I suspect Miss Howard of\\nnot telling all she knows!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ll laugh at meâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. Why should I?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t help feeling,â\\x80\\x9d I continued blunderingly; â\\x80\\x9cthat weâ\\x80\\x99ve rather\\nleft her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\\nhaving been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\\nmiles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\\nthat she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot unexpectedly, â\\x80\\x9cwe can. One of my first\\nactions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\\nand thatâ\\x80\\x94a convoy coming in unexpectedlyâ\\x80\\x94she had kindly offered to\\nremain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\\ndisposes of that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d I said, rather nonplussed. â\\x80\\x9cReally,â\\x80\\x9d I continued, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s her\\nextraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\\nsuspecting her. I canâ\\x80\\x99t help feeling sheâ\\x80\\x99d do anything against him. And\\nI had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\\nwill. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\\none in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou consider her vehemence unnatural?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYâ\\x80\\x94es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\\nsane on that point.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shook his head energetically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\\ndegenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\\nwell-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea wasâ\\x80\\x94a very\\nridiculous one, no doubtâ\\x80\\x94that she had intended to poison himâ\\x80\\x94and that,\\nin some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t at\\nall see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\\nridiculous to the last degree.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\\neverybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\\nthat they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\\nHowardâ\\x80\\x99s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, she was devoted to her!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTcha! Tcha!â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot irritably. â\\x80\\x9cYou argue like a child. If Miss\\nHoward were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\\nequally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\\nare perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\\nAlfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\\nin the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\\nwhich I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\\npresent.â\\x80\\x9d He paused a minute, then went on. â\\x80\\x9cNow, to my way of\\nthinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x99s being the\\nmurderess.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that is?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s death benefit Miss\\nHoward. Now there is no murder without a motive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI reflected.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCould not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\\nperson who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\\nsame position, so I used her name instead.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\\nafternoon of her death mayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\\nBut I can tell you this muchâ\\x80\\x94it was not in Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x99s favour.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\\nso positive about the matter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, with a sigh, â\\x80\\x9cwe will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\\npartly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\\nabout her evidence at the inquest that set me off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot looked puzzled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did I say about her evidence at the inquest?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\\nsuspicion?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOhâ\\x80\\x94ahâ\\x80\\x94yes.â\\x80\\x9d He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. â\\x80\\x9cBy\\nthe way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. What is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNext time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\\nto say this to him. â\\x80\\x98I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFind the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99 Nothing more.\\nNothing less.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.â\\x80\\x99 Is that\\nright?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, much mystified.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcellent.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what does it mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\\nJust say that to him, and see what he says.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery wellâ\\x80\\x94but itâ\\x80\\x99s all extremely mysterious.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnalytical Chemist.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\\nback again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cThat is all my business.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat were you doing there?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, in lively curiosity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI left something to be analysed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that has already been tested!â\\x80\\x9d I cried, stupefied. â\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauerstein\\nhad it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\\nbeing strychnine in it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot quietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\\n\\nThis proceeding of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\\nintensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\\nconfidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\\nrestored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s innocence had been so\\ntriumphantly vindicated.\\n\\nThe funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\\nMonday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\\ninformed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\\nhis quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\\nplans.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd really itâ\\x80\\x99s a great relief to think heâ\\x80\\x99s going, Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued my honest friend. â\\x80\\x9cIt was bad enough before, when we thought\\nheâ\\x80\\x99d done it, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m hanged if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t worse now, when we all feel\\nguilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, weâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ntreated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\\ndid. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now thereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nbeastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\\none doesnâ\\x80\\x99t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\\nthingâ\\x80\\x99s damned awkward! And Iâ\\x80\\x99m thankful heâ\\x80\\x99s had the tact to take\\nhimself off. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a good thing Styles wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the materâ\\x80\\x99s to leave to\\nhim. Couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. Heâ\\x80\\x99s welcome\\nto her money.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to keep up the place all right?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmoney goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\\npresent, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\\nof course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\\nfinancially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn the general relief at Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s approaching departure, we had the\\nmost genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\\nwhose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\\npretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\\nseemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\\nopening of a new and hopeful future.\\n\\nThe papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\\nsandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\\ninnuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\\nNothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\\ninactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\\nfashionable life: â\\x80\\x9cThe Mysterious Affair at Stylesâ\\x80\\x9d was the topic of\\nthe moment.\\n\\nNaturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\\nconstantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\\nadmission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\\nwhere they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\\nhousehold. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\\ncame and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\\ntongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\\nany clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\\nundiscovered crimes?\\n\\nAfter breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\\nshe might have a few words with me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. What is it, Dorcas?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, itâ\\x80\\x99s just this, sir. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\\nto-day perhaps?â\\x80\\x9d I nodded. â\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, you know how he asked me so\\nparticular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes. You have found one?â\\x80\\x9d My interest was aroused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, not that, sir. But since then Iâ\\x80\\x99ve remembered what the young\\ngentlemenâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94John and Lawrence were still the â\\x80\\x9cyoung gentlemenâ\\x80\\x9d to\\nDorcasâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9ccall the â\\x80\\x98dressing-up box.â\\x80\\x99 Itâ\\x80\\x99s up in the front attic, sir. A\\ngreat chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\\nit came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\\nthem. So, if youâ\\x80\\x99d tell the Belgian gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will tell him, Dorcas,â\\x80\\x9d I promised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\\na different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\\nprying about, and asking questions. I donâ\\x80\\x99t hold with foreigners as a\\nrule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\\nBelges isnâ\\x80\\x99t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly heâ\\x80\\x99s a most\\npolite spoken gentleman.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\\nmine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\\nservant that is so fast dying out.\\n\\nI thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\\nPoirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\\ngave him Dorcasâ\\x80\\x99s message.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, althoughâ\\x80\\x94but no\\nmatterâ\\x80\\x94we will examine it all the same.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\\nhall, and we went straight up to the attic.\\n\\nSure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\\nbrass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\\ngarment.\\n\\nPoirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\\nwere one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\\nhead over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\\nthough he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\\nexclamation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\\nwas a magnificent black beard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_OhÃ³!_â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9c_OhÃ³!_â\\x80\\x9d He turned it over in his hands,\\nexamining it closely. â\\x80\\x9cNew,â\\x80\\x9d he remarked. â\\x80\\x9cYes, quite new.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter a momentâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\\nthe other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\\ndownstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\\nbusily polishing her silver.\\n\\nPoirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\\nyou for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\\nthey often used, may I ask?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\\nhave what the young gentlemen call â\\x80\\x98a dress-up night.â\\x80\\x99 And very funny\\nit is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, heâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful. Most comic! I shall\\nnever forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\\ncalled itâ\\x80\\x94a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\\nhis hand, and â\\x80\\x98Mind, Dorcas,â\\x80\\x99 he says, â\\x80\\x98youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to be very\\nrespectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and itâ\\x80\\x99s off with\\nyour head if Iâ\\x80\\x99m at all displeased with you!â\\x80\\x99 Miss Cynthia, she was\\nwhat they call an Apache, or some such nameâ\\x80\\x94a Frenchified sort of\\ncut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. Youâ\\x80\\x99d never have\\nbelieved a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\\nsuch a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese evenings must have been great fun,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot genially. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nsuppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\\nwhen he was Shah of Persia?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe did have a beard, sir,â\\x80\\x9d replied Dorcas, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cAnd well I know\\nit, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know as\\nthere was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\\nI think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\\nhair. Burnt corks they use mostlyâ\\x80\\x94though â\\x80\\x98tis messy getting it off\\nagain. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot\\nthoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think it is _the_ one?â\\x80\\x9d I whispered eagerly.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do. You notice it had been trimmed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s, and I found one\\nor two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho put it in the chest, I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomeone with a good deal of intelligence,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Poirot dryly. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\nrealize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\\npresence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\\nmore intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\\nof being intelligent at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI acquiesced.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\\nthought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, â\\x80\\x9cyou will be\\ninvaluable.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was naturally gratifying, but Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s next words were not so\\nwelcome.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must have an ally in the house,â\\x80\\x9d he observed reflectively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have me,â\\x80\\x9d I protested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTrue, but you are not sufficient.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\\nI want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I see. How about John?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I think not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe dear fellow isnâ\\x80\\x99t perhaps very bright,â\\x80\\x9d I said thoughtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere comes Miss Howard,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cShe is the very\\nperson. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\\nStill, we can but try.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s\\nrequest for a few minutesâ\\x80\\x99 conversation.\\n\\nWe went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Monsieur Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Howard impatiently, â\\x80\\x9cwhat is it? Out\\nwith it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m busy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I do.â\\x80\\x9d The lady nodded. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I told you Iâ\\x80\\x99d help you with\\npleasureâ\\x80\\x94to hang Alfred Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d Poirot studied her seriously. â\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard, I will ask you one\\nquestion. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever tell lies,â\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Howard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\\nher husband?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d she asked sharply. â\\x80\\x9cYou neednâ\\x80\\x99t think your pretty\\nexplanations influence me in the slightest. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll admit that it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhe who bought strychnine at the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop. What of that? I dare\\nsay he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is arsenicâ\\x80\\x94not strychnine,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot mildly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\\njust as well as strychnine. If Iâ\\x80\\x99m convinced he did it, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmatter a jot to me _how_ he did it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot quietly. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nwill put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\\nhearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Howard. â\\x80\\x9cHavenâ\\x80\\x99t I always told you the man\\nis a villain? Havenâ\\x80\\x99t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\\nHavenâ\\x80\\x99t I always hated him like poison?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cThat bears out my little idea entirely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat little idea?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\\nof my friendâ\\x80\\x99s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\\nsentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\\naffirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\\nbeen murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\\ncriminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\\nnonsense?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\\nInglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot curtly. â\\x80\\x9cBecause your instinct is not against Mr.\\nInglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\\ncapable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\\nit. It tells you moreâ\\x80\\x94shall I go on?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\\nmovement of the hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\\nIt is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\\nIt is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\\ntells you another nameâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, no!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsay it! Oh, donâ\\x80\\x99t say it! It isnâ\\x80\\x99t true! It canâ\\x80\\x99t be true. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know\\nwhat put such a wildâ\\x80\\x94such a dreadfulâ\\x80\\x94idea into my head!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am right, am I not?â\\x80\\x9d asked Poirot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it canâ\\x80\\x99t be\\nsoâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shook his head gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t ask me about it,â\\x80\\x9d continued Miss Howard, â\\x80\\x9cbecause I shanâ\\x80\\x99t tell\\nyou. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\\nthing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded, as if satisfied.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\\nAnd Iâ\\x80\\x94I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\\ncommon end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t ask me to help you, because I wonâ\\x80\\x99t. I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t lift a finger\\ntoâ\\x80\\x94toâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d She faltered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothingâ\\x80\\x94but you will\\nbe my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\\nthing that I want of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that is?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will watch!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEvelyn Howard bowed her head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I canâ\\x80\\x99t help doing that. I am always watchingâ\\x80\\x94always hoping I\\nshall be proved wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf we are wrong, well and good,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cNo one will be more\\npleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\\nHoward, on whose side are you then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, I donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt could be hushed up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere must be no hushing up.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut Emily herselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d She broke off.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot gravely, â\\x80\\x9cthis is unworthy of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuddenly she took her face from her hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d she said quietly, â\\x80\\x9cthat was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!â\\x80\\x9d She\\nflung her head up proudly. â\\x80\\x9c_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\\nside of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.â\\x80\\x9d And with these words,\\nshe walked firmly out of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, looking after her, â\\x80\\x9cgoes a very valuable ally.\\nThat woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cInstinct is a marvellous thing,â\\x80\\x9d mused Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cIt can neither be\\nexplained nor ignored.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nobserved coldly. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you donâ\\x80\\x99t realize that _I_ am still in the\\ndark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally? Is that so, _mon ami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Enlighten me, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\\nsurprise, he shook his head decidedly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, my friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, look here, why not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTwo is enough for a secret.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\\npossession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\\na question of ideas.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, it would be interesting to know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see,â\\x80\\x9d he said sadly, â\\x80\\x9c_you_ have no instincts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was intelligence you were requiring just now,â\\x80\\x9d I pointed out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe two often go together,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot enigmatically.\\n\\nThe remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\\ntrouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\\nimportant discoveriesâ\\x80\\x94as no doubt I shouldâ\\x80\\x94I would keep them to myself,\\nand surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\\n\\nThere are times when it is oneâ\\x80\\x99s duty to assert oneself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. DR. BAUERSTEIN\\n\\nI had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s message to\\nLawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\\ngrudge against my friendâ\\x80\\x99s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\\ncroquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\\nwith a still more ancient mallet.\\n\\nIt struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\\nOtherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\\ndid not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\\nLawrenceâ\\x80\\x99s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\\npart, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\\nhim.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been looking for you,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked untruthfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. The truth is, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a message for youâ\\x80\\x94from Poirot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe told me to wait until I was alone with you,â\\x80\\x9d I said, dropping my\\nvoice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\\neye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\\ncreating an atmosphere.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\\nany idea of what I was about to say?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the message.â\\x80\\x9d I dropped my voice still lower. â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Find the extra\\ncoffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth does he mean?â\\x80\\x9d Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\\nastonishment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot in the least. Do you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was compelled to shake my head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat extra coffee-cup?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\\ncoffee-cups. Itâ\\x80\\x99s their business, not mine. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about\\nthe coffee-cups, except that weâ\\x80\\x99ve got some that are never used, which\\nare a perfect dream! Old Worcester. Youâ\\x80\\x99re not a connoisseur, are you,\\nHastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old chinaâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s pure delight to\\nhandle it, or even to look at it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what am I to tell Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell him I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what heâ\\x80\\x99s talking about. Itâ\\x80\\x99s double Dutch to\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\\nback.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.â\\x80\\x99 Are you sure\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t know what it means?â\\x80\\x9d I asked him earnestly.\\n\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he said musingly, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t. Iâ\\x80\\x94I wish I did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\\nPoirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\\nseated at the table.\\n\\nBy tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\\non the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\\nhad been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\\nleant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\\nlittle ideaâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9clittle ideasâ\\x80\\x9d were becoming a perfect\\nbywordâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cand would like to ask one or two questions.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf me? Certainly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\\nleading into Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\\nit was bolted, you say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly it was bolted,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nsaid so at the inquest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBolted?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d She looked perplexed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean,â\\x80\\x9d explained Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cyou are sure it was bolted, and not merely\\nlocked?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I see what you mean. No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. I said bolted, meaning that\\nit was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\\nwere found bolted on the inside.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\\nbeen locked?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, whether that door was bolted or not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I believe it was.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you did not see it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. Iâ\\x80\\x94never looked.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut _I_ did,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Lawrence suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cI happened to notice\\nthat it _was_ bolted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, that settles it.â\\x80\\x9d And Poirot looked crestfallen.\\n\\nI could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his â\\x80\\x9clittle ideasâ\\x80\\x9d\\nhad come to naught.\\n\\nAfter lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\\nstiffly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are annoyed, is it not so?â\\x80\\x9d he asked anxiously, as we walked\\nthrough the park.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all,â\\x80\\x9d I said coldly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\\nobserved the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\\nwent towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI gave Lawrence your message,â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\\nreplied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\\npride forbade me to ask any questions.\\n\\nPoirot switched off on another tack.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\\nlike pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\\ndispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sure she would be delighted. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an interesting little place.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes she go there every day?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\\nThose are her only times off.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia is cleverâ\\x80\\x94oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWithout doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\\nhave very strong poisons there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\\ncupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\\nthe key before leaving the room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, right the other side of the room. Why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wondered. That is all. Will you come in?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had reached the cottage.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. I think Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\\nthrough the woods.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\\nopen park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\\nThere was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\\nfaint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\\ndown at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\\nkindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\\nfact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\\n\\nI thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\\nfar off.\\n\\nI yawned again.\\n\\nProbably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\\nbad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\\nmurdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\\nJohn to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: â\\x80\\x9cI tell you\\nI wonâ\\x80\\x99t have it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI woke up with a start.\\n\\nAt once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\\ntwelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\\neach other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\\nevidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\\nspeak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI tell you, Mary, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMaryâ\\x80\\x99s voice came, cool and liquid:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave _you_ any right to criticize my actions?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\\nSaturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh,â\\x80\\x9d she shrugged her shoulders, â\\x80\\x9cif it is only village gossip that\\nyou mind!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it isnâ\\x80\\x99t. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nPolish Jew, anyway.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens theâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94she looked\\nat himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cstolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\\nrose to Johnâ\\x80\\x99s face in a crimson tide.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMary!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d Her tone did not change.\\n\\nThe pleading died out of his voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAm I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\\nexpress wishes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I choose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou defy me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\\nfriends of whom I should disapprove?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d he said, in an unsteady voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see!â\\x80\\x9d said Mary quietly. â\\x80\\x9cYou _do_ see, donâ\\x80\\x99t you, that _you_ have\\nno right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?â\\x80\\x9d he said unsteadily. He stretched\\nout his hands. â\\x80\\x9cMaryâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\\nface, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\\narm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaryâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94his voice was very quiet nowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9care you in love with this fellow\\nBauerstein?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\\nexpression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\\nit. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\\n\\nShe freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps,â\\x80\\x9d she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\\nleaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\\n\\nRather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\\nwith my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\\nthat I had only just come upon the scene.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\\ncottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\\nworld it is, though!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou find it so?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood Lord, yes! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\\nYard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\\nwhere they wonâ\\x80\\x99t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\\nthe countryâ\\x80\\x94damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\\ncrowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\\nTussaudâ\\x80\\x99s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\\nPretty thick, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCheer up, John!â\\x80\\x9d I said soothingly. â\\x80\\x9cIt canâ\\x80\\x99t last for ever.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\\nhold up our heads again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, youâ\\x80\\x99re getting morbid on the subject.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\\nstared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nworse than that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn lowered his voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you ever thought, Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94itâ\\x80\\x99s a nightmare to meâ\\x80\\x94who did it? I\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\\nBecauseâ\\x80\\x94becauseâ\\x80\\x94who could have done it? Now Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s out of the\\nway, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no one else; no one, I mean, exceptâ\\x80\\x94one of us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\\nsurely it must be so, unlessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94-\\n\\nA new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\\nlight increased. Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s mysterious doings, his hintsâ\\x80\\x94they all fitted\\nin. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\\nwhat a relief for us all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, John,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cit isnâ\\x80\\x99t one of us. How could it be?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know, but, still, who else is there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCanâ\\x80\\x99t you guess?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauerstein!â\\x80\\x9d I whispered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut what earthly interest could he have in my motherâ\\x80\\x99s death?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat I donâ\\x80\\x99t see,â\\x80\\x9d I confessed, â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\\nso.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot? Does he? How do you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI told him of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\\nBauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe said twice: â\\x80\\x98That alters everything.â\\x80\\x99 And Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking. You\\nknow Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\\nwas just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it possible that, as\\nInglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\\ninto the coffee in passing?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m,â\\x80\\x9d said John. â\\x80\\x9cIt would have been very risky.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but it was possible.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nthink that will wash.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut I had remembered something else.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re quite right. That wasnâ\\x80\\x99t how it was done. Listen.â\\x80\\x9d And I then\\ntold him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\\n\\nJohn interrupted just as I had done.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the point. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t see it either until now. Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou understand? Bauerstein had it analysedâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s just it! If\\nBauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\\nsubstitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\\ntested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\\ndream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\\nsampleâ\\x80\\x94except Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I added, with belated recognition.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa wonâ\\x80\\x99t disguise?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, weâ\\x80\\x99ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99s admittedly one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s greatest toxicologistsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s greatest what? Say it again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe knows more about poisons than almost anybody,â\\x80\\x9d I explained. â\\x80\\x9cWell,\\nmy idea is, that perhaps heâ\\x80\\x99s found some way of making strychnine\\ntasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\\ndrug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHâ\\x80\\x99m, yes, that might be,â\\x80\\x9d said John. â\\x80\\x9cBut look here, how could he have\\ngot at the cocoa? That wasnâ\\x80\\x99t downstairs?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d I admitted reluctantly.\\n\\nAnd then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\\nhoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\\nhim. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\\nfor the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\\nDr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\\n\\nYet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\\nCavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\\npoison.\\n\\nAnd suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\\nmy arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\\nevening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\\nBauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\\ndenunciation that the crime had been committed?\\n\\nThen I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\\nEvelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\\npossibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\\n\\nYes, it all fitted in.\\n\\nNo wonder Miss Howard had suggested â\\x80\\x9chushing it up.â\\x80\\x9d Now I understood\\nthat unfinished sentence of hers: â\\x80\\x9cEmily herselfâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d And in my heart I\\nagreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\\nunavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\\nof Cavendish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s another thing,â\\x80\\x9d said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\\nof his voice made me start guiltily. â\\x80\\x9cSomething which makes me doubt if\\nwhat you say can be true.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\\nof how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He neednâ\\x80\\x99t have\\ndone so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\\nheart disease.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I said doubtfully. â\\x80\\x9cBut we donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Perhaps he thought it\\nsafer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\\nHome Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\\ncome out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\\none would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\\ndeceived into calling it heart disease.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s possible,â\\x80\\x9d admitted John. â\\x80\\x9cStill,â\\x80\\x9d he added, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m blest if\\nI can see what his motive could have been.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI trembled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cI may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\\nthis is in confidence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, of courseâ\\x80\\x94that goes without saying.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\\ninto the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\\nthe sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\\n\\nCynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\\nand told her of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s wish to visit the dispensary.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course! Iâ\\x80\\x99d love him to see it. Heâ\\x80\\x99d better come to tea there one\\nday. I must fix it up with him. Heâ\\x80\\x99s such a dear little man! But he\\n_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\\nput it in again, because he said it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t straight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite a mania with him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\\nof Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter tea, I want to talk to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHer glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\\ntwo there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\\nto me to wonder about the girlâ\\x80\\x99s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\\nprovisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\\nprobably insist on her making her home with themâ\\x80\\x94at any rate until the\\nend of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\\nto let her go.\\n\\nJohn, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\\nface wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cConfound those detectives! I canâ\\x80\\x99t think what theyâ\\x80\\x99re after! Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nbeen in every room in the houseâ\\x80\\x94turning things inside out, and upside\\ndown. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\\nbeing out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLot of Paul Prys,â\\x80\\x9d grunted Miss Howard.\\n\\nLawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\\n\\nMary Cavendish said nothing.\\n\\nAfter tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\\ninto the woods together.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\\nthe leafy screen.\\n\\nWith a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\\nsunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\\nto quivering gold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Hastingsâ\\x80\\x94you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\\ngirl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell?â\\x80\\x9d I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI want to ask your advice. What shall I do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\\nsuppose she forgot, or didnâ\\x80\\x99t think she was likely to dieâ\\x80\\x94anyway, I am\\n_not_ provided for! And I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. Do you think I ought\\nto go away from here at once?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens, no! They donâ\\x80\\x99t want to part with you, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\\nThen she said: â\\x80\\x9cMrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHates you?â\\x80\\x9d I cried, astonished.\\n\\nCynthia nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why, but she canâ\\x80\\x99t bear me; and _he_ canâ\\x80\\x99t, either.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere I know youâ\\x80\\x99re wrong,â\\x80\\x9d I said warmly. â\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary, John is\\nvery fond of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yesâ\\x80\\x94_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\\nLawrence hates me or not. Still, itâ\\x80\\x99s rather horrid when no one loves\\nyou, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut they do, Cynthia dear,â\\x80\\x9d I said earnestly. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m sure you are\\nmistaken. Look, there is Johnâ\\x80\\x94and Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia nodded rather gloomily. â\\x80\\x9cYes, John likes me, I think, and of\\ncourse Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be unkind to a fly. But\\nLawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\\nbring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\\nher to, but she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want me, andâ\\x80\\x94andâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSuddenly the poor child burst out crying.\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\\nwith the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\\nrelief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\\nconnection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\\nloneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\\nawkwardly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMarry me, Cynthia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUnwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\\nup at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be silly!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was a little annoyed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\\nmy wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfunny dear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s perfectly sweet of you,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cbut you know you donâ\\x80\\x99t want\\nto!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I do. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind what youâ\\x80\\x99ve got. You donâ\\x80\\x99t really want toâ\\x80\\x94and I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\neither.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, of course, that settles it,â\\x80\\x9d I said stiffly. â\\x80\\x9cBut I donâ\\x80\\x99t see\\nanything to laugh at. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing funny about a proposal.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said Cynthia. â\\x80\\x9cSomebody might accept you next time.\\nGood-bye, youâ\\x80\\x99ve cheered me up _very_ much.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\\nthrough the trees.\\n\\nThinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\\nunsatisfactory.\\n\\nIt occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\\nlook up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\\nAt the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\\nhave as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\\nmy diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cApartmentsâ\\x80\\x9d card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\\ntapped on the door.\\n\\nAn old woman came and opened it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood afternoon,â\\x80\\x9d I said pleasantly. â\\x80\\x9cIs Dr. Bauerstein in?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe stared at me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHavenâ\\x80\\x99t you heard?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeard what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s took.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTook? Dead?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, took by the perlice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the police!â\\x80\\x9d I gasped. â\\x80\\x9cDo you mean theyâ\\x80\\x99ve arrested him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s it, andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. THE ARREST\\n\\nTo my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\\nanswered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\\n\\nI was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\\nit a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\\nwhen he parted from me a few hours earlier?\\n\\nI retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\\nwas uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\\nall probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\\nresolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\\narrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\\nmyself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\\nbe a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\\nsuspicions of her. She could not be implicatedâ\\x80\\x94otherwise I should have\\nheard some hint of it.\\n\\nOf course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\\nconceal Dr. Bauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s arrest from her. It would be announced in\\nevery newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\\nonly Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\\npossessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\\nheightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\\nPoirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\\n\\nAfter some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\\nleave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\\n\\nHe gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGreat Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t believe it at the\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\\nmakes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\\ngenerally known to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJohn reflected.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind,â\\x80\\x9d he said at last, â\\x80\\x9cwe wonâ\\x80\\x99t say anything at present. There\\nis no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\\neagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\\nThere was a column of mere padding about â\\x80\\x9cThe Styles Poisoning Case,â\\x80\\x9d\\nbut nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\\nfor some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\\nworried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\\nmight be further arrests to come.\\n\\nAfter breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\\nhad returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\\none of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Bonjour, mon ami!_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\\ndragged him into the room. â\\x80\\x9cI was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\\nI have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friend,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cI do not know what you are talking\\nabout.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDr. Bauersteinâ\\x80\\x99s arrest, of course,â\\x80\\x9d I answered impatiently.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs Bauerstein arrested, then?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you not know it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot the least in the world.â\\x80\\x9d But, pausing a moment, he added: â\\x80\\x9cStill,\\nit does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\\ncoast.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe coast?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, puzzled. â\\x80\\x9cWhat has that got to do with it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSurely, it is obvious!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\\nproximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\\nInglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing at all, of course,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot, smiling. â\\x80\\x9cBut we were\\nspeaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. â\\x80\\x9cDr.\\nBauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\\nfriend?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, no one exactly told me,â\\x80\\x9d I confessed. â\\x80\\x9cBut he is arrested.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEspionage?â\\x80\\x9d I gasped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecisely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,â\\x80\\x9d replied\\nPoirot placidly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94but I thought you thought so too?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\\nsense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to say,â\\x80\\x9d I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you never suspected it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt never entered my head.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\\nbury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\\nof walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I confessed, â\\x80\\x9cI never thought of such a thing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe is, of course, a German by birth,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthough he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\\nhim as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\\nyears ago. A very clever manâ\\x80\\x94a Jew, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe blackguard!â\\x80\\x9d I cried indignantly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\\nlose. I admire the man myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut I could not look at it in Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s philosophical way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\\nall over the country!â\\x80\\x9d I cried indignantly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Poirot.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\\nother vagaries of the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s passed unobserved.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you think he never really cared for her?â\\x80\\x9d I asked eagerlyâ\\x80\\x94rather\\ntoo eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat, of course, I cannot say, butâ\\x80\\x94shall I tell you my own private\\nopinion, Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\\ncared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you really think so?â\\x80\\x9d I could not disguise my pleasure.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\\nover me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\\nremembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\\nperhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicateâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94\\n\\nMy pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\\nHoward. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\\nthe room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\\nhanded to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn top of the wardrobe.â\\x80\\x9d Then she hurriedly left the room.\\n\\nPoirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\\nof satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initialâ\\x80\\x94J. or L.?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\\nlain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\\nParksonâ\\x80\\x99s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\\nto â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x94(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\\nMary, Essex.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might be T., or it might be L.,â\\x80\\x9d I said, after studying the thing\\nfor a minute or two. â\\x80\\x9cIt certainly isnâ\\x80\\x99t a J.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. â\\x80\\x9cI, also, am of\\nyour way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did it come from?â\\x80\\x9d I asked curiously. â\\x80\\x9cIs it important?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cModerately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\\nexistence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\\nbeen successful.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did she mean by â\\x80\\x98On the top of the wardrobeâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe meant,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot promptly, â\\x80\\x9cthat she found it on top of a\\nwardrobe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA funny place for a piece of brown paper,â\\x80\\x9d I mused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\\npaper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\\narranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I asked earnestly, â\\x80\\x9chave you made up your mind about this\\ncrime?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unlessâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d With\\nsudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\\ncalling out in French in his excitement: â\\x80\\x9cMademoiselle Dorcas,\\nMademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, sâ\\x80\\x99il vous plaÃ®t!_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy good Dorcas, I have an ideaâ\\x80\\x94a little ideaâ\\x80\\x94if it should prove\\njustified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\\nDorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\\nwith Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s bell?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas looked very surprised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how you came\\nto hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\\nthrough. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\\nthe morning-room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSee you, one should not ask for outside proofâ\\x80\\x94no, reason should be\\nenough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\\nthe right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\\nleap!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\\nstretch of lawn outside the long window.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is your remarkable little friend doing?â\\x80\\x9d asked a voice behind me,\\nand I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\\nI. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it all about?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\\nand appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\\nyou see!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMary laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow ridiculous! Heâ\\x80\\x99s going out of the gate. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t he coming back\\nto-day?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve given up trying to guess what heâ\\x80\\x99ll do next.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI honestly donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\\nhatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\\nin his madness.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\\nseemed grave, almost sad.\\n\\nIt occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\\nthe subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\\nhad not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\\nthis case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\\nof encountering any unkindness from me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t thoughtâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 But again\\nshe stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\\nCynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Hastings,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cdo you think I and my husband are happy\\ntogether?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about itâ\\x80\\x99s not\\nbeing my business to think anything of the sort.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d she said quietly, â\\x80\\x9cwhether it is your business or not, I will\\ntell you that we are _not_ happy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\\n\\nShe began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\\nand that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\\nstopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about me, do you?â\\x80\\x9d she asked. â\\x80\\x9cWhere I come\\nfrom, who I was before I married Johnâ\\x80\\x94anything, in fact? Well, I will\\ntell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\\nthinkâ\\x80\\x94yes, I am sure you are kind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSomehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\\nthat Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\\nfather confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\\nyoung man.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy father was English,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Cavendish, â\\x80\\x9cbut my mother was a\\nRussian.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cnow I understandâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUnderstand what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA hint of something foreignâ\\x80\\x94differentâ\\x80\\x94that there has always been about\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy mother was very beautiful, I believe. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know, because I never\\nsaw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\\nsome tragedy connected with her deathâ\\x80\\x94she took an overdose of some\\nsleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\\nbroken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\\nEverywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\\nbeen nearly all over the world. It was a splendid lifeâ\\x80\\x94I loved it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\\nliving in the memory of those old glad days.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\\nwith some old aunts in Yorkshire.â\\x80\\x9d She shuddered. â\\x80\\x9cYou will understand\\nme when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\\nbeen. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.â\\x80\\x9d\\nShe paused a minute, and added in a different tone: â\\x80\\x9cAnd then I met\\nJohn Cavendish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou can imagine that, from my auntsâ\\x80\\x99 point of view, it was a very good\\nmatch for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\\nwith me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\\nmonotony of my life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\\nwas true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\\nmore, but that I was not in any way what the world calls â\\x80\\x98in loveâ\\x80\\x99 with\\nhim. He declared that that satisfied him, and soâ\\x80\\x94we were married.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\\nShe seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thinkâ\\x80\\x94I am sureâ\\x80\\x94he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\\nwell matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. Heâ\\x80\\x94it is not a pleasing\\nthing for my pride, but it is the truthâ\\x80\\x94tired of me very soon.â\\x80\\x9d I must\\nhave made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, he\\ndid! Not that it matters nowâ\\x80\\x94now that weâ\\x80\\x99ve come to the parting of the\\nways.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe answered quietly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou and John are not going to live here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn may live here, but I shall not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are going to leave him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe paused a long time, and said at last:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhapsâ\\x80\\x94because I want to beâ\\x80\\x94free!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\\nof forests, untrodden landsâ\\x80\\x94and a realization of what freedom would\\nmean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\\nmoment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\\nsome shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t know, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know, how this hateful place has been prison\\nto me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cbutâ\\x80\\x94but donâ\\x80\\x99t do anything rash.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, rash!â\\x80\\x9d Her voice mocked at my prudence.\\n\\nThen suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAn instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\\nexpression.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJohn was so kind as to break that to me this morning.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, what do you think?â\\x80\\x9d I asked feebly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf the arrest?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\\nhad told John.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHer face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\\ncare, or did she not?\\n\\nShe moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\\nmovingâ\\x80\\x94thank you, Mr. Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d And she walked quietly past me out of\\nthe window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\\n\\nNo, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\\npart with that icy unconcern.\\n\\nPoirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\\nno sign of the Scotland Yard men.\\n\\nBut, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidenceâ\\x80\\x94or rather\\nlack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\\nMrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\\nefforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\\nit might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\\nin the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\\na firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\\nof Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\\nof Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\\nabandoned.\\n\\nJust before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\\ndisappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGone to London again?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. â\\x80\\x98To see a\\nyoung ladyâ\\x80\\x99s dispensary,â\\x80\\x99 he said.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSilly ass!â\\x80\\x9d I ejaculated. â\\x80\\x9cI told him Wednesday was the one day she\\nwasnâ\\x80\\x99t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\\nyou?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly, monsieur.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\\nwas really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\\n\\nAfter lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\\nsee him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\\nexcited in his manner roused my curiosity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d I asked. â\\x80\\x9cI could go if thereâ\\x80\\x99s anything special.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s nothing much, butâ\\x80\\x94well, if you are going, will you tell himâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d he\\ndropped his voice to a whisperâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI think Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found the extra\\ncoffee-cup!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s, but now my\\ncuriosity was aroused afresh.\\n\\nLawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\\nhigh horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\\n\\nThis time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\\nWould I mount? I mounted accordingly.\\n\\nPoirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\\nsprang up at my entrance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?â\\x80\\x9d I asked solicitously. â\\x80\\x9cYou are not ill, I trust?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhether to catch the criminal or not?â\\x80\\x9d I asked facetiously.\\n\\nBut, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98To speak or not to speak,â\\x80\\x99 as your so great Shakespeare says, â\\x80\\x98that\\nis the question.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI did not trouble to correct the quotation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not serious, Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\\nthe balance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that is?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA womanâ\\x80\\x99s happiness, _mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d he said gravely.\\n\\nI did not quite know what to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe moment has come,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot thoughtfully, â\\x80\\x9cand I do not know\\nwhat to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\\nbut I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!â\\x80\\x9d And he tapped himself proudly\\non the breast.\\n\\nAfter pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\\neffect, I gave him Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x99s message.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAha!â\\x80\\x9d he cried. â\\x80\\x9cSo he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\\nHe has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\\nLawrence of yours!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI did not myself think very highly of Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x99s intelligence; but I\\nforebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\\nforgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s days off.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\\nwas most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\\neverything in the kindest way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\\nanother day.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI told him about the letter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am sorry for that,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI always had hopes of that letter. But\\nno, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.â\\x80\\x9d\\nHe tapped his forehead. â\\x80\\x9cThese little grey cells. It is â\\x80\\x98up to themâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94as\\nyou say over here.â\\x80\\x9d Then, suddenly, he asked: â\\x80\\x9cAre you a judge of\\nfinger-marks, my friend?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I said, rather surprised, â\\x80\\x9cI know that there are no two\\nfinger-marks alike, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s as far as my science goes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\\nlaid on the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI studied the proofs attentively.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfinger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a ladyâ\\x80\\x99s; they are\\nmuch smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94I paused for\\nsome timeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthere seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\\nvery distinctly, are No. 1â\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOverlapping the others?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou recognize them beyond fail?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes; they are identical.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\\nagain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cthat as usual, you are not going to explain?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\\nNo. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\\nmerely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\\ncomplicated.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\\nblur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\\nspecial apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\\nwell-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\\nphotograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\\ntime. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marksâ\\x80\\x94it remains to\\ntell you the particular object on which they had been left.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo onâ\\x80\\x94I am really excited.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\\ntiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\\nCross Hospital at Tadminsterâ\\x80\\x94which sounds like the house that Jack\\nbuilt!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed. â\\x80\\x9cBut what were Lawrence Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfinger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\\nday we were there!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, he did!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible! We were all together the whole time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\\nThere was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\\nwould not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\\njoin you on the balcony.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d forgotten that,â\\x80\\x9d I admitted. â\\x80\\x9cBut it was only for a moment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLong enough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLong enough for what?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s smile became rather enigmatical.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLong enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\\nvery natural interest and curiosity.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur eyes met. Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\\nlittle tune. I watched him suspiciously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cwhat was in this particular little bottle?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot looked out of the window.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHydro-chloride of strychnine,â\\x80\\x9d he said, over his shoulder, continuing\\nto hum.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\\nexpected that answer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very littleâ\\x80\\x94only\\noccasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\\nHydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\\nfinger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you manage to take this photograph?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dropped my hat from the balcony,â\\x80\\x9d explained Poirot simply. â\\x80\\x9cVisitors\\nwere not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\\napologies, Mademoiselle Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s colleague had to go down and fetch it\\nfor me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you knew what you were going to find?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\\nstory, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\\npossibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cyour gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\\nimportant discovery.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not know,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cBut one thing does strike me. No doubt\\nit has struck you too.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\\nThis is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\\nMrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\\ncounter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\\nhandled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\\ndo not like confusion.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBefore I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\\nstuck his head in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA lady?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\\nwas standing in the doorway.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been visiting an old woman in the village,â\\x80\\x9d she explained, â\\x80\\x9cand\\nas Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\\ncall for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlas, madame,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cI thought you had come to honour me with\\na visit!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will some day, if you ask me,â\\x80\\x9d she promised him, smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is well. If you should need a father confessor, madameâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94she\\nstarted ever so slightlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cremember, Papa Poirot is always at your\\nservice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\\ndeeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEnchanted, madame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAll the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\\nthat in some way she was nervous of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\nThe weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\\nshrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\\ncoat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\\nsome great giant sighing.\\n\\nWe walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\\ncame to us that something was wrong.\\n\\nDorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\\nhands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\\nbackground, all eyes and ears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, mâ\\x80\\x99am! Oh, mâ\\x80\\x99am! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to tell youâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, Dorcas?â\\x80\\x9d I asked impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cTell us at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s those wicked detectives. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve arrested himâ\\x80\\x94theyâ\\x80\\x99ve arrested\\nMr. Cavendish!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArrested Lawrence?â\\x80\\x9d I gasped.\\n\\nI saw a strange look come into Dorcasâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir. Not Mr. Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x94Mr. John.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBehind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\\nas I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\\n\\nThe trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\\ntwo months later.\\n\\nOf the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\\nsympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\\npassionately on her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s side, scorning the mere idea of his\\nguilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\\n\\nI expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\\nbrings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\\njealousy haveâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJealousy?â\\x80\\x9d I queried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\\nI was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\\nof nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\\nhim.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\\nthat last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\\nspeak. With his tenderness for â\\x80\\x9ca womanâ\\x80\\x99s happiness,â\\x80\\x9d I felt glad that\\nthe decision had been taken out of his hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEven now,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cI can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\\nlast minute, I thought it was Lawrence!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot grinned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know you did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut John! My old friend John!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEvery murderer is probably somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s old friend,â\\x80\\x9d observed Poirot\\nphilosophically. â\\x80\\x9cYou cannot mix up sentiment and reason.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must say I think you might have given me a hint.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\\nfriend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\\non to John what I believed to be Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s views concerning Bauerstein.\\nHe, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\\nNevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\\nthe charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\\nwere pretty well clipped for the future.\\n\\nI asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\\nintense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\\nlikely to be acquitted.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, Poirotâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d I protested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\\nIt is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\\nmatter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\\nevidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\\nlack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\\nlinkâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d He shook his head gravely.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did you first suspect John Cavendish?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, after a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you not suspect him at all?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\\nCavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\\nat the inquest?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\\nAlfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wifeâ\\x80\\x94and you remember,\\nhe strenuously denied it at the inquestâ\\x80\\x94it must be either Lawrence or\\nJohn. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s conduct was just as\\ninexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\\nwas explained quite naturally.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo,â\\x80\\x9d I cried, a light breaking in upon me, â\\x80\\x9cit was John who quarrelled\\nwith his mother that afternoon?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you have known this all along?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly. Mrs. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour could only be explained that\\nway.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet you say he may be acquitted?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\\ncase for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\\nadvise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\\ntrial. Andâ\\x80\\x94ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\\nfriend. I must not appear in the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\\nlast link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\\nmust think I am working for her husband, not against him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say, thatâ\\x80\\x99s playing it a bit low down,â\\x80\\x9d I protested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\\nand we must use any means in our powerâ\\x80\\x94otherwise he will slip through\\nour fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\\nbackground. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\\ntake all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at allâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he\\nsmiled broadlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cit will probably be as a witness for the defence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could hardly believe my ears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is quite _en rÃ¨gle_,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cStrangely enough, I can\\ngive evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich one?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\\ndid not destroy that will.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\\ncourt proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\\nmerely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\\nduly committed for trial.\\n\\nSeptember found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\\nPoirot being included in the family party.\\n\\nI myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\\nthem continually.\\n\\nAs the weeks went by, the state of Poirotâ\\x80\\x99s nerves grew worse and\\nworse. That â\\x80\\x9clast linkâ\\x80\\x9d he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\\nhoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\\nif John were not acquitted?\\n\\nOn September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\\nBailey, charged with â\\x80\\x9cThe Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,â\\x80\\x9d and\\npleaded â\\x80\\x9cNot Guilty.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\\nhim.\\n\\nMr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\\n\\nThe murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\\nwas neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\\ntrusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\\nEver since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\\nlived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\\nattention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\\n\\nHe proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\\nand spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\\nalso been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\\nneighbouring farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife. This having come to his stepmotherâ\\x80\\x99s ears,\\nshe taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\\nensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\\nhad purchased strychnine at the village chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop, wearing a\\ndisguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\\nanother manâ\\x80\\x94to wit, Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s husband, of whom he had been\\nbitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\\nproduce an unimpeachable alibi.\\n\\nOn the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\\nquarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\\nfound destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\\nevidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\\nfavour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\\nbefore her marriage, butâ\\x80\\x94and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\\nforefingerâ\\x80\\x94the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\\ndeceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\\nnot say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\\nformer one; orâ\\x80\\x94this seemed to him more likelyâ\\x80\\x94she may have had an idea\\nthat it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\\nconversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\\nlegal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\\nfavour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\\nprisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\\nnight. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\\nwhich occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\\nwill which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\\nvalid.\\n\\nThe prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\\nroom, by Detective Inspector Jappâ\\x80\\x94a most brilliant officerâ\\x80\\x94of the\\nidentical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\\nchemistâ\\x80\\x99s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\\nIt would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\\nconstituted an overwhelming proof of the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s guilt.\\n\\nAnd, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\\nunthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\\n\\nThe first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\\ncalled at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\\nunscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\\nquestions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\\nto â\\x80\\x9cMr. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\\nInglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\\ncross-examined.\\n\\nAlfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\\nHe also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\\ntestified to the accuracy of these statements.\\n\\nThe gardenersâ\\x80\\x99 evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\\nand then Dorcas was called.\\n\\nDorcas, faithful to her â\\x80\\x9cyoung gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d denied strenuously that it\\ncould have been Johnâ\\x80\\x99s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\\nteeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\\nboudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\\nface of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\\ngallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\\ndeny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\\ngive evidence against her husband.\\n\\nAfter various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\\nLawrence Cavendish from Parksonâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDorcas shook her head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\\nfrom home part of June.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\\nwould be done with it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would either be put in his room or sent on after him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\\nwho would attend to anything like that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEvelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\\nquestioned as to the parcel.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t remember. Lots of parcels come. Canâ\\x80\\x99t remember one special one.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\\nor whether it was put in his room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\\nwas.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSupposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\\nafterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\\npaper?â\\x80\\x9d He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\\nin the morning-room at Styles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I did.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow did you come to look for it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\\nfor it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did you eventually discover it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn the top ofâ\\x80\\x94ofâ\\x80\\x94a wardrobe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn top of the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s wardrobe?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I believe so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you not find it yourself?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you must know where you found it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it was on the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s wardrobe.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is better.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAn assistant from Parksonâ\\x80\\x99s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\\nJune 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\\nrequested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\\nNo, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\\ntheir books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to â\\x80\\x9cL. Cavendish,\\nEsq., Styles Court.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere was the letter written from?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom Styles Court.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe same address to which you sent the parcel?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd the letter came from there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLike a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\\npostmark?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNoâ\\x80\\x94butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\\nconfidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\\npostmark?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYâ\\x80\\x94es.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\\nbeen posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\\nsignified that he was satisfied.\\n\\nElizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\\ngone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\\nof leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\\naccordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\\nslight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\\nhad seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s door.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\\nbullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\\nagain with a satisfied smile on his face.\\n\\nWith the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\\nas to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\\nproceedings were adjourned until the following day.\\n\\nAs we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\\ncounsel.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\\ntwisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said consolingly, â\\x80\\x9cit will be the other way about to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. â\\x80\\x9cMr.\\nHastings, you do not thinkâ\\x80\\x94surely it could not have been Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x94Oh,\\nno, that could not be!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\\nasked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot appreciatively. â\\x80\\x9cHe is a clever man, that Sir\\nErnest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you think he believes Lawrence guilty?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\\nfor is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\\ndivided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\\nto make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\\nagainst Johnâ\\x80\\x94and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nDetective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\\nwas reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\\nrelating the earlier events, he proceeded:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cActing on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\\nsearched the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s room, during his temporary absence from the\\nhouse. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\\nfound: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\\nMr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94these were exhibitedâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9csecondly, this phial.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe phial was that already recognized by the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s assistant, a\\ntiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\\ncrystalline powder, and labelled: â\\x80\\x9cStrychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\\ncourt proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\\nhad been found in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s cheque book, and on being reversed\\nat a mirror, showed clearly the words: â\\x80\\x9c. . . erything of which I die\\npossessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...â\\x80\\x9d This placed\\nbeyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\\nthe deceased ladyâ\\x80\\x99s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\\npaper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\\nbeard in the attic, completed his evidence.\\n\\nBut Sir Ernestâ\\x80\\x99s cross-examination was yet to come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat day was it when you searched the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTuesday, the 24th of July.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly a week after the tragedy?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\\ndrawer unlocked?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\\ncrime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\\nto find?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe might have stowed them there in a hurry.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\\nhave had ample time to remove them and destroy them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\\nplenty of time to remove and destroy them?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\\nor light?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeavyish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\\nwould not be likely to go to that drawer?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\\na hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\\nunderclothing. Yes, or no?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\\nhave been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\\nunaware of their presence?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should not think it likely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut it is possible?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMore evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\\nwhich the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\\nhis intrigue with Mrs. Raikesâ\\x80\\x94poor Mary, that must have been bitter\\nhearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\\nfacts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\\njump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\\n\\nLawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\\nto Mr. Philipsâ\\x80\\x99 questions, he denied having ordered anything from\\nParksonâ\\x80\\x99s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\\nWales.\\n\\nInstantly, Sir Ernestâ\\x80\\x99s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou deny having ordered a black beard from Parksonâ\\x80\\x99s on June 29th?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\\ninherit Styles Court?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrenceâ\\x80\\x99s pale face.\\nThe judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\\nprisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\\n\\nHeavywether cared nothing for his clientâ\\x80\\x99s anger.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnswer my question, if you please.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Lawrence quietly, â\\x80\\x9cthat I should.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by you â\\x80\\x98supposeâ\\x80\\x99? Your brother has no children. You\\n_would_ inherit it, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, thatâ\\x80\\x99s better,â\\x80\\x9d said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. â\\x80\\x9cAnd\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cReally, Sir Ernest,â\\x80\\x9d protested the judge, â\\x80\\x9cthese questions are not\\nrelevant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\\nvisit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid youâ\\x80\\x94while you happened to be alone for a few secondsâ\\x80\\x94unlock the\\npoison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94may have done so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI put it to you that you did do so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you examine one bottle in particular?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not think so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\\nHydro-chloride of Strychnine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNâ\\x80\\x94oâ\\x80\\x94I am sure I didnâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\\nimpress of your finger-prints on it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen why did you take it up?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! So poisons â\\x80\\x98naturally interestâ\\x80\\x99 you, do they? Still, you waited to\\nbe alone before gratifying that â\\x80\\x98interestâ\\x80\\x99 of yours?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\\njust the same.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStill, as it happens, the others were not there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\\nof minutes, and it happenedâ\\x80\\x94I say, it happenedâ\\x80\\x94to be during those two\\nminutes that you displayed your â\\x80\\x98natural interestâ\\x80\\x99 in Hydro-chloride of\\nStrychnine?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLawrence stammered pitiably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\\nheads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\\ntogether, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\\nthreatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\\nsilence.\\n\\nThere was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\\nupon for their opinion of the signature of â\\x80\\x9cAlfred Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x9d in the\\nchemistâ\\x80\\x99s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\\ncertainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\\nbe that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\\nit might be the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\\n\\nSir Ernest Heavywetherâ\\x80\\x99s speech in opening the case for the defence was\\nnot a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\\nmanner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\\nknown a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\\nentirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\\nunproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\\nimpartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\\nprisonerâ\\x80\\x99s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\\nout, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\\nthe prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\\nwicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\\nthe crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\\nshred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\\nprisoner who ordered the black beard from Parksonâ\\x80\\x99s. The quarrel which\\nhad taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\\nadmitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\\nexaggerated.\\n\\nHis learned friendâ\\x80\\x94Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philipsâ\\x80\\x94had\\nstated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\\nforward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\\nInglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\\nthe facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\\nThe prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\\nauthoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\\nand Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisonerâ\\x80\\x99s head that\\nanyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\\nInglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\\nquarrels.\\n\\nThe prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\\nentered the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\\nThe prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\\nMarstonâ\\x80\\x99s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\\ncouched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\\nmatters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\\nhad, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\\nvainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\\nwith no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\\nhis story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\\nas evidence.\\n\\nAs for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\\nprisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\\naware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\\nrevoked by his stepmotherâ\\x80\\x99s remarriage. He would call evidence to show\\nwho did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\\nquite a new view of the case.\\n\\nFinally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\\nother people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\\nthe fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\\nstrong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\\n\\nHe would now call the prisoner.\\n\\nJohn acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernestâ\\x80\\x99s\\nskilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\\nnote received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\\nThe readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\\nthe disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\\n\\nAt the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\\nof Sir Ernest Heavywetherâ\\x80\\x99s insinuations against my brother. My\\nbrother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that Johnâ\\x80\\x99s\\nprotest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\\n\\nThen the cross-examination began.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\\nwitnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\\nthat of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\\nmother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\\nnot really the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\\nconversationâ\\x80\\x94fragments which you must have recognized?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not recognize them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour memory must be unusually short!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\\npaid very little attention to my motherâ\\x80\\x99s actual words.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Philipsâ\\x80\\x99 incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\\npassed on to the subject of the note.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\\nnothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot that I know of.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\\nhand-writingâ\\x80\\x94carelessly disguised?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I do not think so.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\\nidea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\\nnote yourself in order to bear out your statement!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\\nabout at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\\nchemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\\nthe name of Alfred Inglethorp?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, that is a lie.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s clothes, with\\na black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were thereâ\\x80\\x94and signed the\\nregister in his name!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is absolutely untrue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\\nthe note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\\njury,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\\ndone his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\\nperjury.\\n\\nAfter this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\\n\\nPoirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\\nlittle frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, Poirot?â\\x80\\x9d I inquired.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\\na likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\\n\\nWhen we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Maryâ\\x80\\x99s offer of\\ntea.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\\na small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\\nand, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\\n\\nMy jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\\nthat is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\\nprecision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\\nneeded that more than now!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the trouble?â\\x80\\x9d I asked.\\n\\nWith a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\\nup edifice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\\nhigh, but I cannotâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94thumpâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cfindâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94thumpâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9c that last link of which I\\nspoke to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\\nslowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is doneâ\\x80\\x94so! By placingâ\\x80\\x94one cardâ\\x80\\x94on anotherâ\\x80\\x94with\\nmathematicalâ\\x80\\x94precision!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\\nnever hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\\ntrick.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a steady hand youâ\\x80\\x99ve got,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked. â\\x80\\x9cI believe Iâ\\x80\\x99ve only seen\\nyour hand shake once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,â\\x80\\x9d observed Poirot,\\nwith great placidity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\\nyou discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\\nthings on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\\nmust sayâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\\ncry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\\nover his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\\nkeenest agony.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens, Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d I cried. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter? Are you taken\\nill?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d he gasped. â\\x80\\x9cIt isâ\\x80\\x94it isâ\\x80\\x94that I have an idea!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, much relieved. â\\x80\\x9cOne of your â\\x80\\x98little ideasâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, _ma foi_, no!â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot frankly. â\\x80\\x9cThis time it is an idea\\ngigantic! Stupendous! And youâ\\x80\\x94_you_, my friend, have given it to me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\\nand before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\\n\\nMary Cavendish entered at that moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\\nout: â\\x80\\x98A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!â\\x80\\x99\\nAnd, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\\nstreet, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\\ngesture of despair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\\nround the corner!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOur eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat can be the matter?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\\nhad an idea, and rushed off as you saw.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Mary, â\\x80\\x9cI expect he will be back before dinner.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. THE LAST LINK\\n\\nPoirotâ\\x80\\x99s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\\nwore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three oâ\\x80\\x99clock a\\nferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\\nPoirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\\nlittle man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\\nwith exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadame, I have your permission to hold a little _rÃ©union_ in the\\n_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMary smiled sadly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\\nway.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are too amiable, madame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nStill beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\\nforward chairs as he did so.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howardâ\\x80\\x94here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\\nDorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\\nuntil Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMiss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf that man comes into the house, I leave it!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no!â\\x80\\x9d Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\\n\\nFinally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\\nlater Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\\n\\nThe company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\\npopular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\\nJohn Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\\nof the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\\nlocked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\\noccurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\\non the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\\nbromide powders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\\nbolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\\noccupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\\npolice who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\\nrecognize it for what it wasâ\\x80\\x94a piece torn from a green land armlet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThere was a little stir of excitement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow there was only one person at Styles who worked on the landâ\\x80\\x94Mrs.\\nCavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\\ndeceasedâ\\x80\\x99s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\\nCynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that door was bolted on the inside!â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\\nword for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\\nreported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\\nopportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\\nverifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\\nexactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\\nMrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\\nof the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\\nstatement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\\nthe building, just outside Mrs. Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s door. I myself, in company\\nwith the police, went to the deceasedâ\\x80\\x99s room, and whilst there I,\\napparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\\nthat, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\\nThis confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\\nwhen she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\\nthe tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\\nown room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceasedâ\\x80\\x99s room when the\\nalarm was given.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\\nmother-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\\nhas not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\\nwith an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\\ntable, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\\nstartled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\\npicks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room,\\nclosing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\\nservants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\\nfootsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\\nWhat can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girlâ\\x80\\x99s\\nroom, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\\ntrooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\\narrived with the rest, butâ\\x80\\x94and this is significantâ\\x80\\x94I can find no one\\nwho saw her come from the other wing.â\\x80\\x9d He looked at Mary Cavendish. â\\x80\\x9cAm\\nI right, madame?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe bowed her head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\\ndo my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\\nBut it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\\ninnocence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\\nmisconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\\nsignificance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe will!â\\x80\\x9d cried Lawrence. â\\x80\\x9cThen it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\\nwill?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nShe shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d he said quietly. â\\x80\\x9cThere is only one person who could possibly\\nhave destroyed that willâ\\x80\\x94Mrs. Inglethorp herself!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed. â\\x80\\x9cShe had only made it out that very\\nafternoon!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\\nway can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\\nthe year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\\nbeing incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\\nYet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\\nsomething, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\\nconsequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\\nwas thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\\ndocument such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\\nMrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\\ndestroy some important documentâ\\x80\\x94possibly a will. So the discovery of\\nthe charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\\ncourse, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\\nthis afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\\ninto a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndetermination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\\nquarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\\nplace after, and not before the making of the will.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\\nI faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Dorcas\\noverheard her mistress saying angrily: â\\x80\\x98You need not think that any\\nfear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.â\\x80\\x9d\\nI conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\\naddressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\\nstandpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to\\ndo; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.â\\x80\\x99 At four\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\\nshock.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLooking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\\nwas convinced was correct. The second â\\x80\\x98scandalâ\\x80\\x99 she spoke of was not\\nthe same as the firstâ\\x80\\x94and it concerned herself!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us reconstruct. At four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\\nson, and threatens to denounce him to his wifeâ\\x80\\x94who, by the way,\\noverheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\\nInglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\\nmakes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\\nAt five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\\nagitation, with a slip of paperâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98a letter,â\\x80\\x99 Dorcas thinksâ\\x80\\x94in her hand,\\nand it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\\nPresumably, then, between four-thirty and five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, something has\\noccurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\\nas anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\\nthat something?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\\nentered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\\nof sentiment?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\\nstood her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s deskâ\\x80\\x94locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\\nsearching for the stamps she came across something elseâ\\x80\\x94that slip of\\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\\nfor Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\\nthat the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\\nwas a written proof of her own husbandâ\\x80\\x99s infidelity. She demanded it\\nfrom Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\\nto do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\\njealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\\ncosts, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\\npick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s despatch-case, which had been lost\\nthat morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\\nimportant papers in this particular case.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\\ndesperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\\nshe unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room.\\nPossibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\\nquite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\\nearly hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\\naccustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\\ncompletely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\\nMademoiselle Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot if you were drugged, mademoiselle.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDrugged?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Mais, oui!_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou rememberâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94he addressed us collectively againâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cthat through all the\\ntumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\\ntwo possibilities. Either her sleep was feignedâ\\x80\\x94which I did not\\nbelieveâ\\x80\\x94or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\\ncarefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\\nMademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\\neach cup, and had them analysedâ\\x80\\x94with no result. I had counted the cups\\ncarefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\\ntaken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\\nmistaken.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\\nCoffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\\nBauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\\nwhole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\\nnothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\\nseven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\\nDorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\\nusualâ\\x80\\x94or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\\nfound broken in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\\nI had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\\ncups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\\nher coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\\nâ\\x80\\x98saltâ\\x80\\x99 on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\\nsent it to be analysed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,â\\x80\\x9d said Lawrence\\nquickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\\nwas, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\\nnarcotic.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor a narcotic?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Here is the analystâ\\x80\\x99s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\\nbut effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\\nCynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart dâ\\x80\\x99heure_ in\\nconsequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\\ntaken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word â\\x80\\x98Poisonâ\\x80\\x99!\\nShe has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\\nperfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\\nshe must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s death lay at her door. She\\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\\ndoing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\\nbeing so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\\nstrychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\\nawful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\\nI understand nowâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\\nPoirot, eh? But you would not trust me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see everything now,â\\x80\\x9d said Lawrence. â\\x80\\x9cThe drugged cocoa, taken on top\\nof the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\\nlittle difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat?â\\x80\\x9d The cry of surprise was universal.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\\nwas still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\\nthe nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\\nhappened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\\nlittle case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\\nhad deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\\nexactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\\non reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\\nplayed her the same trick.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\\ntable by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\\nheated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\\nwith a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\\ncoffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\\nbetween seven and nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock that evening. What third medium was\\nthereâ\\x80\\x94a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\\nit is extraordinary no one has thought of it?â\\x80\\x9d Poirot looked round the\\nroom, and then answered himself impressively. â\\x80\\x9cHer medicine!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\\ntonic?â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere was no need to introduce it. It was already thereâ\\x80\\x94in the\\nmixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\\nstrychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\\nread you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\\nDispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98The following prescription has become famous in text books:\\n\\n\\n          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\\n\\n          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\\n\\n          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\\n\\n          Fiat Mistura\\n\\n\\n_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\\nstrychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\\nin England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\\nstrychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\\nswallowed nearly all of it!_\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkinsâ\\x80\\x99 prescription, but\\nyou will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\\nor two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\\nwould effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\\nand cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\\nthe person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s medicine was always\\nextremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\\nthe bottom of it undisturbed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThroughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\\nintended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\\nInglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\\nMademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\\nInglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\\nshut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\\nprobability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\\nhurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\\nforgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\\nhome, so that the lastâ\\x80\\x94and fatalâ\\x80\\x94dose was actually taken twenty-four\\nhours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\\nto that delay that the final proofâ\\x80\\x94the last link of the chainâ\\x80\\x94is now in\\nmy hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAmid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA letter in the murdererâ\\x80\\x99s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\\nlittle clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\\nwarned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\\nbut not the manner of it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\\nclearing his throat, read:\\n\\nDearest Evelyn:\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x98You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all rightâ\\x80\\x94only it\\n    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\n    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\\n    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\\n    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\\n    circumspect. A false stepâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\\ninterrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\\nknow this hand-writing andâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou devil! How did you get it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\\non his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Messieurs, mesdames_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, with a flourish, â\\x80\\x9clet me\\nintroduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. POIROT EXPLAINS\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoirot, you old villain,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve half a mind to strangle you!\\nWhat do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWe were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\\nthe room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\\nInglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\\nto myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\\n\\nPoirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\\nnature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, thatâ\\x80\\x94_enfin_, to\\nconceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\\nvery first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\\nwould haveâ\\x80\\x94in your so expressive idiomâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x98smelt a ratâ\\x80\\x99! And then,\\n_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy friend,â\\x80\\x9d besought Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cI implore you, do not enrage yourself!\\nYour help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\\nbeautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I grumbled, a little mollified. â\\x80\\x9cI still think you might have\\ngiven me a hint.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\\nnow, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\\nnot, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\\nacquitted?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\\nbringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\\nspeaking of two entirely different persons?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cit was not plain to me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen again,â\\x80\\x9d continued Poirot, â\\x80\\x9cat the beginning, did I not repeat to\\nyou several times that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\\nThat should have conveyed something to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\\nfrom that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\\nidea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\\nMr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\\nconnect him with it. When I arrived at the chÃ¢teau, I realized at once\\nthat it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\\nway, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\\nyou the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d I said impatiently. â\\x80\\x9cGo on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s guilt were\\nvery much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\\nI was inclined to believe that he had not done it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did you change your mind?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\\nefforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\\nInglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\\nJohn Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSimply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\\nwith Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\\ndiscovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\\nwas attracted by the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\\ndifferent interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\\nof the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\\nattitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\\nthe conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\\nfrom that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\\narrested.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a minute. I donâ\\x80\\x99t see why he wished to be arrested?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\\nacquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\\nwas cleverâ\\x80\\x94his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\\nknew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\\nthe exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\\nagainst himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\\nirreproachable alibiâ\\x80\\x94and, hey presto, he was safe for life!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I still donâ\\x80\\x99t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\\nthe chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot stared at me in surprise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\\nMiss Howard who went to the chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Howard?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\\nheight, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\\nInglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\\nthem, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\\nThey are a clever pair!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\\ndone,â\\x80\\x9d I remarked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s large sized\\nbottle of medicine when it came from Cootâ\\x80\\x99s? The risk is practically\\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\\ncleverâ\\x80\\x94and that was their undoing.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPoirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\\nstrychnine at the village chemistâ\\x80\\x99s, and signing the register in his\\nhand-writing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOn Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\\nMonday, therefore, at six oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\\nseen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\\nHoward has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\\nRaikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\\nchemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\\nwrites the name of Alfred Inglethorp in Johnâ\\x80\\x99s handwriting, which she\\nhad previously studied carefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\\nhim an anonymous noteâ\\x80\\x94still copying his hand-writingâ\\x80\\x94which takes him to\\na remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\\nhim.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\\nInglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\\nin any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\\nafter all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\\nCavendish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\\nthat night. The broken bell, Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s absenceâ\\x80\\x94arranged by Inglethorp\\nthrough his wifeâ\\x80\\x94all these are wasted. And thenâ\\x80\\x94he makes his slip.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\\nwho, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\\nis probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\\nCaught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\\ndesk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\\nagain, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\\nhe could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\\ndreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\\nincriminating document.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\\nbecomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\\nunfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\\nher mind. She knows that she is in dangerâ\\x80\\x94but is ignorant of where the\\ndanger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\\nand writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\\nalso determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\\nmade. She keeps the fatal letter.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\\nof the despatch-case?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\\nrealized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\\nnothing to connect him with the crime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s only one thing I canâ\\x80\\x99t make out, why didnâ\\x80\\x99t he destroy it at\\nonce when he got hold of it?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause he did not dare take the biggest risk of allâ\\x80\\x94that of keeping\\nit on his own person.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\\nonly five short minutes in which he could have taken itâ\\x80\\x94the five\\nminutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\\nthat time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\\npassed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\\nthe room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeysâ\\x80\\x94they\\nwere all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-caseâ\\x80\\x94it is locked, and\\nthe keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\\nmeans that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\\nhoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\\nof that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\\npenknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\\nfor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\\non him. He may be seen leaving the roomâ\\x80\\x94he may be searched. If the\\npaper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\\ntoo, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\\nboudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\\npaper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\\nare sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\\ndare not keep it. He looks round, and he seesâ\\x80\\x94what do you think, _mon\\nami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\\nthem up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\\nspills in the vase on the mantle-piece.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI uttered an exclamation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo one would think of looking there,â\\x80\\x9d Poirot continued. â\\x80\\x9cAnd he will\\nbe able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\\nof evidence against him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorpâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbedroom, under our very noses?â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\n\\nPoirot nodded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my friend. That is where I discovered my â\\x80\\x98last link,â\\x80\\x99 and I owe\\nthat very fortunate discovery to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\\nstraightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t seeâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\\nthe morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\\nthe objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\\nthere would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\\nmeantime, someone else had touched them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me,â\\x80\\x9d I murmured, â\\x80\\x9cso that is the explanation of your\\nextraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\\nthere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, and it was a race for time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I still canâ\\x80\\x99t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\\nleave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\\nconfidence on the subject?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\\nif Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\\nwould not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\\nand by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\\nprevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\\nmaking the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\\ndetectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\\naware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\\nthe document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\\nit in the spill vase.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paperâ\\x80\\x99s existence. In\\naccordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\\nInglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\\nCavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\\nmeeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\\nsooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\\nclever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\\none had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\\nthey would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\\nhave been able to bring him to justice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\\nHoward?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\\nletter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, what was there to lie about?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x94more or less.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\\ndistinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\\nyou look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\\nâ\\x80\\x98July 17thâ\\x80\\x99 is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\\nmean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I confessed, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\\nthe 7thâ\\x80\\x94the day after Miss Howardâ\\x80\\x99s departure? The â\\x80\\x981â\\x80\\x99 was written in\\nbefore the â\\x80\\x987â\\x80\\x99 to turn it into the â\\x80\\x9817thâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\\nletter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\\nshe did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\\nonce a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\\nwas wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd yet,â\\x80\\x9d I cried indignantly, â\\x80\\x9cafter that, you gave me two reasons\\nwhy Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd very good reasons too,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cFor a long time they were\\na stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\\nthat she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\\ncommitted the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\\ndebar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\\nover-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\\nThere was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\\ncame to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plotâ\\x80\\x94that he\\nshould marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\\na will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\\ncleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\\nprobably have left England, and lived together on their poor victimâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmoney.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\\nbe directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\\nvery different _dÃ©nouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\\ncompromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\\nnotice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\\nstrychnine and glasses in Johnâ\\x80\\x99s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\\nShe will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,â\\x80\\x9d I\\nremarked. â\\x80\\x9cIt would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\\nhome to Lawrence.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\\nof pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\\nthe pair of schemers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHis manner was unfortunate,â\\x80\\x9d I observed thoughtfully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\\nthe crime?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I exclaimed, astonished. â\\x80\\x9cImpossible!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\\nI asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\\nthe bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\\nimpersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\\nevidence against her than anyone else.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are joking, Poirot!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\\nfirst entered his motherâ\\x80\\x99s room on the fatal night? It was because,\\nwhilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\\nshoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthiaâ\\x80\\x99s room was unbolted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he declared that he saw it bolted!â\\x80\\x9d I cried.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExactly,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot dryly. â\\x80\\x9cAnd that was just what confirmed my\\nsuspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why should he shield her?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause he is in love with her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI laughed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\\nfar from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho told you that, _mon ami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCynthia herself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe said that she did not mind at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen she certainly did mind very much,â\\x80\\x9d remarked Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cThey are\\nlike thatâ\\x80\\x94_les femmes!_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,â\\x80\\x9d I said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\\nface every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\\nbrother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\\nwas in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his motherâ\\x80\\x99s room, and\\nsaw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\\nMademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\\ndriven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\\nfeet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\\nbefore, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\\ncontents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\\nthe theory of â\\x80\\x98Death from natural causesâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what about the â\\x80\\x98extra coffee-cupâ\\x80\\x99?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\\nI had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\\nbut, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\\nextra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\\nAnd he was perfectly right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOne thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey were, of course, an accusation against her husband.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear me, Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said with a sigh, â\\x80\\x9cI think you have explained\\neverything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\\nwife are reconciled.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThanks to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you meanâ\\x80\\x94thanks to you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\\ntrial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\\nloved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\\nwith him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\\nmisunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\\nsensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\\ndid not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\\nboth unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\\ndrifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\\ncultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\\nJohn Cavendishâ\\x80\\x99s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\\ndecision?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I quite understood your distress.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\\nwas trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\\nonce. I could have cleared himâ\\x80\\x94though it might have meant a failure to\\nconvict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\\nreal attitude up to the very last momentâ\\x80\\x94which partly accounts for my\\nsuccess.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\\nbrought to trial?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of â\\x80\\x98a womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhappinessâ\\x80\\x99. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\\ncould have brought these two proud souls together again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\\nlittle man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\\nmurder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,â\\x80\\x9d said Poirot, smiling at me. â\\x80\\x9cNo\\none but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\\nwrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\\ngreatest thing in all the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHis words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\\nwhite and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\\nthe sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\\ndoor, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. â\\x80\\x9cYes, madame,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said. â\\x80\\x9cI have brought him back to you.â\\x80\\x9d He had stood aside, and as I\\nwent out I had seen the look in Maryâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, as John Cavendish had\\ncaught his wife in his arms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps you are right, Poirot,â\\x80\\x9d I said gently. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it is the\\ngreatest thing in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94I onlyâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in,â\\x80\\x9d I said, springing up.\\n\\nShe came in, but did not sit down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x94only wanted to tell you somethingâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nCynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\\nexclaiming: â\\x80\\x9cYou dears!â\\x80\\x9d kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\\nout of the room again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth does this mean?â\\x80\\x9d I asked, surprised.\\n\\nIt was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\\nsalute rather impaired the pleasure.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\\nher as much as she thought,â\\x80\\x9d replied Poirot philosophically.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cButâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere he is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLawrence at that moment passed the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh! Monsieur Lawrence,â\\x80\\x9d called Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cWe must congratulate you, is\\nit not so?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\\nspectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\\n\\nI sighed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, _mon ami?_â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing,â\\x80\\x9d I said sadly. â\\x80\\x9cThey are two delightful women!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd neither of them is for you?â\\x80\\x9d finished Poirot. â\\x80\\x9cNever mind. Console\\nyourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And thenâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s The Mysterious Affair at Styles, by Agatha Christie\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 863-0.txt or 863-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/6/863/\\n\\nProduced by Charles Keller\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

The\\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.

Time is precious, and Crito\\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\\nThessaly and other places.\\n\\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\\nwill say \\'the many can kill us,\\' that makes no difference; but a good life,\\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\\n\\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\\nhim:  they will ask \\'Why does he seek to overturn them?\\' and if he replies,\\n\\'they have injured him,\\' will not the Laws answer, \\'Yes, but was that the\\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\\nthan any other citizen.\\'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\\nwhether he is alive or dead?\\n\\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\\n\\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\\n\\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\\nopinion that Socrates \\'did well to die,\\' but not for the \\'sophistical\\'\\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  \\'A\\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.\\'  It may be\\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\\n\\'the world,\\' but the \\'one wise man,\\' is still the paradox of Socrates in\\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\\nevil; in his own words, \\'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.\\'\\n\\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\\n\\'common principle,\\' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\\noccur in Plato.\\n\\n\\nCRITO\\n\\nby\\n\\nPlato\\n\\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\\n\\n\\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\\n\\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\\n\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\\n\\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\\n\\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\\nhim a kindness.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\\n\\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\\nawakening me?\\n\\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\\nrepining at the approach of death.\\n\\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\\nage does not prevent them from repining.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\\nearly hour.\\n\\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\\nall to me.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\\nam to die?\\n\\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\\nyour life.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\\n\\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\\n\\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\\nthe ship?\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\\n\\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\\n\\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\\n\\n\\'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.\\'  (Homer, Il.)\\n\\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\\n\\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\\n\\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\\nthe result of chance.\\n\\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\\ndo as I say.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\\nthe only one.\\n\\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\\nas I say.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\\nunwise are evil?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\\n\\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\\none only, and not of the many?\\n\\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\\n\\nCRITO:  True.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\\nwill he not suffer evil?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\\nin the disobedient person?\\n\\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\\n\\nCRITO:  Far more.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--\\'Well,\\' some one will\\nsay, \\'but the many can kill us.\\'\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\\nchiefly valued?\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\\nholds also?\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one\\'s children, are, I\\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\\ncalculation.\\n\\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\\n\\nCRITO:  I will.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\\n\\nCRITO:  Yes.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\\n\\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\\n\\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\\n\\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\\nof the many--is that just or not?\\n\\nCRITO:  Not just.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\\n\\nCRITO:  Very true.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\\n\\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\\nhe to betray the right?\\n\\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\\n\\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  \\'Tell us,\\nSocrates,\\' they say; \\'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\\nindividuals?\\'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, \\'Yes; but\\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.\\'  Suppose I say\\nthat?\\n\\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  \\'And was that our agreement with you?\\' the law would answer; \\'or\\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?\\'  And if I were to express\\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  \\'Answer,\\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?\\'  None, I should reply.\\n\\'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\\nmusic and gymnastic?\\'  Right, I should reply.  \\'Well then, since you were\\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\\nhe do violence to his country.\\'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\\n\\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  \\'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\\ndoes neither.\\n\\n\\'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\\nother Athenians.\\'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\\nagreement.  \\'There is clear proof,\\' they will say, \\'Socrates, that we and\\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\\nnot?\\'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\\n\\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\\n\\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  \\'You, Socrates, are breaking the\\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\\n\\n\\'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\\nto Crito\\'s friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\\n\\n\\'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.\\'\\n\\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.

Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any\\nof these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nCREDIT\\n\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\\n\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.

The\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\n\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\n\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\n\\n\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

The Man in the Field\\n\\nWhen the Susquehanna stage came to the daily halt beneath the\\nblasted pine at the cross-roads, an elderly man, wearing a\\nflapping frock coat and a soft slouch hat, stepped gingerly over\\none of the muddy wheels, and threw a doubtful glance across the\\nlevel tobacco fields, where the young plants were drooping in the\\nJune sunshine.\\n\\n\"So this is my way, is it?\" he asked, with a jerk of his thumb\\ntoward a cloud of blue-and-yellow butterflies drifting over a\\nshining puddle--\"five miles as the crow flies, and through a\\nbog?\"\\n\\nFor a moment he hung suspended above the encrusted axle, peering\\nwith blinking pale-gray eyes over a pair of gold-rimmed\\nspectacles. In his appearance there was the hint of a scholarly\\nintention unfulfilled, and his dress, despite its general\\ncarelessness, bespoke a different standard of taste from that of\\nthe isolated dwellers in the surrounding fields. A casual\\nobserver might have classified him as one of the Virginian\\nlandowners impoverished by the war; in reality, he was a\\nsuccessful lawyer in a neighbouring town, who, amid the overthrow\\nof the slaveholding gentry some twenty years before, had risen\\ninto a provincial prominence.\\n\\nHis humour met with a slow response from the driver, who sat\\nplayfully flicking at a horsefly on the flank of a tall,\\nraw-boned sorrel. \"Wall, thar\\'s been a sight of rain lately,\" he\\nobserved, with goodnatured acquiescence, \"but I don\\'t reckon the\\nmud\\'s more\\'n waist deep, an\\' if you do happen to git clean down,\\nthar\\'s Sol Peterkin along to pull you out. Whar\\'re you hidin\\',\\nSol? Why, bless my boots, if he ain\\'t gone fast asleep!\"\\n\\nAt this a lean and high-featured matron, encased in the rigidity\\nof her Sunday bombazine, gave a prim poke with her umbrella in\\nthe ribs of a sparrow-like little man, with a discoloured,\\nscraggy beard, who nodded in one corner of the long seat.\\n\\n\"I\\'d wake up if I was you,\" she remarked in the voice her sex\\nassumes when virtue lapses into severity.\\n\\nStarting from his doze, the little man straightened his wiry,\\nsunburned neck and mechanically raised his hand to wipe away a\\nthin stream of tobacco juice which trickled from his half-open\\nmouth.\\n\\n\"Hi!we ain\\'t got here a\\'ready!\" he exclaimed, as he spat\\nenergetically into the mud. \"I d\\'clar if it don\\'t beat all--one\\nminute we\\'re thar an\\' the next we\\'re here. It\\'s a movin\\' world we\\nlive in, ain\\'t that so, mum?\" Then, as the severe matron still\\nstared unbendingly before her, he descended between the wheels,\\nand stood nervously scraping his feet in the long grass by the\\nroadside.\\n\\n\"This here\\'s Sol Peterkin, Mr. Carraway,\" said the driver, bowing\\nhis introduction as he leaned forward to disentangle the reins\\nfrom the sorrel\\'s tail, \"an\\' I reckon he kin pint out Blake Hall\\nto you as well as another, seem\\' as he was under-overseer thar\\nfor eighteen years befo\\' the war. Now you\\'d better climb in agin,\\nfolks; it\\'s time we were off.\"\\n\\nHe gave an insinuating cluck to the horses, while several\\npassengers, who had alighted to gather blackberries from the\\nditch, scrambled hurriedly into their places. With a single\\nclanking wrench the stage toiled on, plodding clumsily over the\\nmiry road.\\n\\nAs the spattering mud-drops fell round him, Carraway lifted his\\nhead and sniffed the air like a pointer that has been just turned\\nafield. For the moment his professional errand escaped him as his\\nchest expanded in the light wind which blew over the radiant\\nstillness of the Virginian June. From the cloudless sky to its\\npure reflection in the rain-washed roads there was barely a\\ndescending shade, and the tufts of dandelion blooming against the\\nrotting rail fence seemed but patches of the clearer sunshine.\\n\\n\"Bless my soul, it\\'s like a day out of Scripture!\" he exclaimed\\nin a tone that was half-apologetic; then raising his\\nwalking-stick he leisurely swept it into space. \"There\\'s hardly\\nanother crop, I reckon, between here and the Hall?\"\\n\\nSol Peterkin was busily cutting a fresh quid of tobacco from the\\nplug he carried in his pocket, and there was a brief pause before\\nhe answered. Then, as he carefully wiped the blade of his knife\\non the leg of his blue jean overalls, he looked up with a curious\\nfacial contortion.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'ll find a corn field or two somewhar along,\" he replied,\\n\"but it\\'s a lanky, slipshod kind of crop at best, for tobaccy\\'s\\nking down here, an\\' no mistake. We\\'ve a sayin\\' that the man that\\nain\\'t partial to the weed can\\'t sleep sound even in the\\nchurchyard, an\\' thar\\'s some as \\'ill swar to this day that Willie\\nMoreen never rested in his grave because he didn\\'t chaw, an\\' the\\nsoil smelt jest like a plug. Oh, it\\'s a great plant, I tell you,\\nsuh. Look over thar at them fields; they\\'ve all been set out\\nsence the spell o\\' rain.\"\\n\\nThe road they followed crawled like a leisurely river between the\\nfreshly ploughed ridges, where the earth was slowly settling\\naround the transplanted crop. In the distance, labourers were\\nstill at work, passing in dull-blue blotches between the rows of\\nbright-green leaves that hung limply on their slender stalks.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve lived at the Hall, I hear,\" said Carraway, suddenly\\nturning to look at his companion over his lowered glasses.\\n\\n\"When it was the Hall, suh,\" replied Sol, with a tinge of\\nbitterness in his chuckle. \"Why, in my day, an\\' that was up to\\nthe very close of the war, you might stand at the big gate an\\'\\nlook in any direction you pleased till yo\\' eyes bulged fit to\\nbust, but you couldn\\'t look past the Blake land for all yo\\'\\ntryin\\'. These same fields here we\\'re passin\\' through I\\'ve seen\\nset out in Blake tobaccy time an\\' agin, an\\' the farm I live on\\nthree miles beyond the Hall belonged to the old gentleman, God\\nbless him! up to the day he died. Lord save my soul! three\\nhunnard as likely niggers as you ever clap sight on, an\\' that not\\ncountin\\' a good fifty that was too far gone to work.\"\\n\\n\"All scattered now, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"See them little cabins over yonder?\" With a dirty forefinger he\\npointed to the tiny trails of smoke hanging low above the distant\\ntree-tops. \"The county\\'s right speckled with \\'em an\\' with thar\\nchildren--all named Blake arter old marster, as they called him,\\nor Corbin arter old miss. When leetle Mr. Christopher got turned\\nout of the Hall jest befo\\' his pa died, an\\' was shuffled into the\\nhouse of the overseer, whar Bill Fletcher used to live himself,\\nthe darkies all bought bits o\\'land here an\\' thar an\\' settled down\\nto do some farmin\\' on a free scale. Stuck up, suh! Why, Zebbadee\\nBlake passed me yestiddy drivin\\' his own mule-team, an\\' I heard\\nhim swar he wouldn\\'t turn out o\\' the road for anybody less\\'n God\\nA\\'mighty or Marse Christopher!\"\\n\\n\"A-ahem!\" exclaimed Carraway, with relish; \"and in the meantime,\\nthe heir to all this high-handed authority is no better than an\\nilliterate day-labourer.\"\\n\\nPeterkin snorted. \"Who? Mr. Christopher? Well, he warn\\'t more\\'n\\nten years old when his pa went doty an\\' died, an\\' I don\\'t reckon\\nhe\\'s had much larnin\\' sence. I\\'ve leant on the gate myself an\\'\\nwatched the nigger children traipsin\\' by to the Yankee woman\\'s\\nschool, an\\' he drivin\\' the plough when he didn\\'t reach much\\nhigher than the handle. He\\' used to be the darndest leetle brat,\\ntoo, till his sperits got all freezed out o\\' him. Lord! Lord!\\nthar\\'s such a sight of meanness in this here world that it makes\\na body b\\'lieve in Providence whether or no.\"\\n\\nCarraway meditatively twirled his walking-stick. \"Raises tobacco\\nnow like the rest, doesn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Not like the rest--bless you, no, suh. Why, the weed thrives\\nunder his very touch, though he can\\'t abide the smell of it, an\\'\\nthar\\'s not a farmer in the county that wouldn\\'t ruther have him\\nto plant, cut, or cure than any ten men round about. They do say\\nthat his pa went clean crazy about tobaccy jest befo\\' he died,\\nan\\' that Mr. Christopher gets dead sick when he smells it smokin\\'\\nin the barn, but he kin pick up a leaf blindfold an\\' tell you the\\nquality of it at his first touch.\"\\n\\nFor a moment the lawyer was silent, pondering a thought he\\nevidently did not care to utter. When at last he spoke it was in\\nthe measured tones of one who overcomes an impediment in his\\nspeech.\\n\\n\"Do you happen to have heard, I wonder, anything of his attitude\\ntoward the present owner of the Hall?\"\\n\\n\"Happen to have heard!\" Peterkin threw back his head and gasped.\\n\"Why, the whole county has happened to hear of it, I reckon. It\\'s\\nbeen common talk sence the day he got his first bird-gun, an\\' his\\nnigger, Uncle Boaz, found him hidin\\' in the bushes to shoot old\\nFletcher when he came in sight. I tell you, if Bill Fletcher lay\\ndyin\\' in the road, Mr. Christopher would sooner ride right over\\nhim than not. You ask some folks, suh, an\\' they\\'ll tell you a\\nBlake kin hate twice as long as most men kin love.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, is it so bad as that?\" muttered Carraway.\\n\\n\"Well, he ain\\'t much of a Christian, as the lights go,\" continued\\nSol, \"but I ain\\'t sartain, accordin\\' to my way of thinkin\\', that\\nhe ain\\'t got a better showin\\' on his side than a good many of \\'em\\nthat gits that befo\\' the preacher. He\\'s a Blake, skin an\\' bone,\\nanyhow, an\\' you ain\\'t goin\\' to git this here county to go agin\\nhim--not if he was to turn an\\' spit at Satan himself. Old Bill\\nFletcher stole his house an\\' his land an\\' his money, law or no\\nlaw--that\\'s how I look at it--but he couldn\\'t steal his name, an\\'\\nthat\\'s what counts among the niggers, an\\' the po\\' whites, too.\\nWhy, I\\'ve seen a whole parcel o\\' darkies stand stock still when\\nFletcher drove up to the bars with his spankin\\' pair of bays, an\\'\\nthen mos\\' break tha\\' necks lettin\\' \\'em down as soon as Mr.\\nChristopher comes along with his team of oxen. You kin fool the\\nquality \\'bout the quality, but I\\'ll be blamed if you kin fool the\\nniggers.\"\\n\\nAhead of them there was a scattered group of log cabins,\\nsurrounded by little whitewashed palings, and at their approach a\\ndecrepit old Negro, followed by a slinking black-and-tan\\nfoxhound, came beneath the straggling hopvine over one of the\\ndoors and through the open gate out into the road. His bent old\\nfigure was huddled within his carefully patched clothes of coarse\\nbrown homespun.\\n\\n\"Howdy, marsters,\" he muttered, in answer to the lawyer\\'s\\ngreeting, raising a trembling hand to his wrinkled forehead.\\n\"Y\\'all ain\\' seen nuttin\\' er ole miss\\'s yaller cat, Beulah, I\\nreckon?\"\\n\\nPeterkin, who had eyed him with the peculiar disfavour felt for\\nthe black man by the low-born white, evinced a sudden interest\\nout of all proportion to Carraway\\'s conception of the loss.\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t she done come back yet, Uncle Boaz?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Naw, suh, dat she ain\\', en ole miss she ain\\' gwine git a wink er\\nsleep dis blessed night. Me en Spy we is done been traipsin\\'\\nroun\\' atter dat ar low-lifeted Beulah sence befo\\' de\\ndinner-bell.\"\\n\\n\"When did you miss her first?\" asked Peterkin, with concern.\\n\\n\"I dunno, suh, dat I don\\'t, caze she ain\\' no better\\'n one er dese\\nyer wish-wishys,* an\\' I ain\\' mek out yit ef\\'n twuz her er her\\nhant. Las\\' night \\'bout sundown dar she wuz a-lappin\\' her sasser\\ner milk right at ole miss feet, en dis mawnin\\' at sunup dar she\\nwarn\\'t. Dat\\'s all I know, suh, ef\\'n you lay me out.\"\\n\\n* Will-o\\'-the-wisp.\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon she\\'ll turn up agin,\" said Peterkin consolingly.\\n\"Cats air jest like gals, anyway--they ain\\'t never happy unless\\nthey\\'re eternally gallyvantin\\'. Why, that big white Tom of mine\\nknows more about this here county than I do myself.\"\\n\\n\"Days so, suh; days de gospel trufe; but I\\'se kinder flustered\\n\\'bout dat yaller cat caze ole miss sutney do set a heap er sto\\'\\nby \\'er. She ain\\' never let de dawgs come in de \\'oom, nohow, caze\\nonce she done feel Beulah rar \\'er back at Spy. She\\'s des stone\\nblin\\', is ole miss, but I d\\'clar she kin smell pow\\'ful keen, an\\'\\n\\'taro\\' no use tryin\\' ter fool her wid one houn\\' er de hull pack.\\nLawd! Lawd! I wunner ef dat ar cat kin be layin\\' close over\\nyonder at Sis Daphne\\'s?\"\\n\\nHe branched off into a little path which ran like a white thread\\nacross the field, grumbling querulously to the black-and-tan\\nfoxhound that ambled at his heels.\\n\\n\"Dar\\'s a wallopin\\' ahaid er you, sho\\'s you bo\\'n,\" he muttered, as\\nhe limped on toward a small log hut from which floated an\\ninviting fragrance of bacon frying in fat. \"I reckon you lay dat\\nyou kin cut yo\\' mulatter capers wid me all you please, but you\\'d\\nbetter look out sharp \\'fo\\' you begin foolin\\' \\'long er Marse\\nChristopher. Dar you go agin, now. Ain\\' dat des like you? Wat you\\nwanter go sickin\\' atter dat ole hyar fer, anyhow?\"\\n\\n\"So that is one of young Blake\\'s hangers-on?\" observed Carraway,\\nwith a slight inflection of inquiry.\\n\\n\"Uncle Boaz, you mean? Oh, he was the old gentleman\\'s\\nbody-servant befo\\' the war. He used to wear his marster\\'s\\ncast-off ruffles an\\' high hat. A mighty likely nigger he was,\\ntoo,\\ntill he got all bent up with the rheumatics.\"\\n\\nThe lawyer had lifted his walking-stick and was pointing straight\\nahead to a group of old brick chimneys huddled in the sunset\\nabove a grove of giant oaks.\\n\\n\"That must be Blake Hall over there,\" he said; \"there\\'s not\\nanother house like it in the three counties.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll be at the big gate in a minute, suh,\" Peterkin returned.\\n\"This is the first view of the Hall you git, an\\' they say the old\\ngentleman used to raise his hat whenever he passed by it.\" Then\\nas they swung open the great iron gate, with its new coat of red,\\nhe touched Carraway\\'s sleeve and spoke in a hoarse whisper.\\n\"Thar\\'s Mr. Christopher himself over yonder,\" he said, \"an\\' Lord\\nbless my soul, if he ain\\'t settin\\' out old Fletcher\\'s plants.\\nThar! he\\'s standin\\' up now--the big young fellow with the basket.\\nThe old gentleman was the biggest man twixt here an\\'\\nFredericksburg, but I d\\'clar Mr. Christopher is a good half-head\\ntaller!\"\\n\\nAt his words Carraway stopped short in the road, raising his\\nuseless glasses upon his brow. The sun had just gone down in a\\nblaze of light, and the great bare field was slowly darkening\\nagainst the west.\\n\\nNearer at hand there were the long road, already in twilight, the\\nrail fence wrapped in creepers, and a solitary chestnut tree in\\nfull bloom. Farther away swept the freshly ploughed ground over\\nwhich passed the moving figures of the labourers transplanting\\nthe young crop. Of them all, Carraway saw but a single worker--in\\nreality, only one among the daily toilers in the field, moulded\\nphysically perhaps in a finer shape than they, and limned in the\\nlawyer\\'s mental vision against a century of the brilliant if\\ntragic history of his race. As he moved slowly along between the\\neven rows, dropping from time to time a plant into one of the\\nsmall holes dug before him, and pausing with the basket on his\\narm to settle the earth carefully with his foot, he seemed,\\nindeed, as much the product of the soil upon which he stood as\\ndid the great white chestnut growing beside the road. In his\\npose, in his walk, in the careless carriage of his head, there\\nwas something of the large freedom of the elements.\\n\\n\"A dangerous young giant,\" observed the lawyer slowly, letting\\nhis glasses fall before his eyes. \"A monumental Blake, as it\\nwere. Well, as I have remarked before upon occasions, blood will\\ntell, even at the dregs.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s the very spit of his pa, that\\'s so,\" replied Peterkin, \"an\\'\\nthough it\\'s no business of mine, I\\'m afeared he\\'s got the old\\ngentleman\\'s dry throat along with it. Lord! Lord! I\\'ve always\\nstood it out that it\\'s better to water yo\\' mouth with tobaccy\\nthan to burn it up with sperits.\" He checked himself and fell\\nback hastily, for young Blake, after a single glance at the west,\\nhad tossed his basket carelessly aside, and was striding\\nvigorously across the field.\\n\\n\"Not another plant will I set out, and that\\'s an end of it!\" he\\nwas saying angrily. \"I agreed to do a day\\'s work and I\\'ve been at\\nit steadily since sunrise. Is it any concern of mine, I\\'d like to\\nknow, if he can\\'t put in his crop to-night? Do you think I care\\nwhether his tobacco rots in the ground or out of it?\"\\n\\nAs he came on, Carraway measured him coolly, with an appreciation\\ntempered by his native sense of humour. He perceived at once a\\ncertain coarseness of finish which, despite the deep-rooted\\nveneration for an idle ancestry, is found most often in the\\ndescendants of a long line of generous livers. A moment later he\\nweighed the keen gray flash of the eyes beneath the thick fair\\nhair, the coating of dust and sweat over the high-bred curve from\\nbrow to nose, and the fullness of the jaw which bore with a\\nsuggestion of sheer brutality upon the general impression of a\\nfine racial type. Taken from the mouth up, the face might have\\npassed as a pure, fleshly copy of the antique idea; seen\\ndownward, it became almost repelling in its massive power.\\n\\nStooping beside the fence for a common harvest hat, the young man\\nplaced it on his head, and gave a careless nod to Peterkin. He\\nhad thrown one leg over the rails, and was about to swing himself\\ninto the road, when Sol spoke a little timidly.\\n\\n\"I hear yo\\' ma\\'s done lost her yaller cat, Mr. Christopher.\"\\n\\nFor an instant Christopher hung midway of the fence.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the beast back yet?\" he asked irritably, scraping the mud\\nfrom his boot upon the rail. \"I\\'ve had Uncle Boaz scouring the\\ncounty half the day.\"\\n\\nA pack of hounds that had been sleeping under the sassafras\\nbushes across the road came fawning to his feet, and he pushed\\nthem impatiently aside.\\n\\n\"I was thinkin\\',\" began Peterkin, with an uncertain cough, \"that\\nI might manage to send over my big white Tom, an\\', bein\\' blind,\\nmaybe she wouldn\\'t know the difference.\"\\n\\nChristopher shook his head.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s no use,\" he replied, speaking with an air of\\nsuperiority. \"She could pick out that cat among a million, I\\nbelieve, with a single touch. Well, there\\'s no help for it. Down,\\nSpot--down, I say, Sir!\"\\n\\nWith a leisurely movement he swung himself from the fence,\\nstopping to wipe his brow with his blue cotton sleeve. Then he\\nwent whistling defiantly down the way to the Hall, turning at\\nlast into a sunken road that trailed by an abandoned ice-pond\\nwhere bullfrogs were croaking hoarsely in the rushes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. The Owner of Blake Hall\\n\\nAs they followed the descending road between flowering chestnuts,\\nBlake Hall rose gradually into fuller view, its great oaks\\nbrowned by the approaching twilight and the fading after-glow\\nreflected in a single visible pane. Seen close at hand, the house\\npresented a cheerful spaciousness of front--a surety of light and\\nair--produced in part by the clean white, Doric columns of the\\nportico and in part by the ample slope of shaven lawn studded\\nwith reds of brightly blooming flowers. From the smoking chimneys\\npresiding over the ancient roof to the hospitable steps leading\\nfrom the box-bordered walk below, the outward form of the\\ndwelling spoke to the imaginative mind of that inner spirit which\\nhad moulded it into a lasting expression of a racial sentiment,\\nas if the Virginia creeper covering the old brick walls had\\nwreathed them in memories as tenacious as itself.\\n\\nFor more than two hundred years Blake Hall had stood as the one\\ngreat house in the county--a manifestation in brick and mortar of\\nthe hereditary greatness of the Blakes. To Carraway, impersonal\\nas his interest was, the acknowledgment brought a sudden vague\\nresentment, and for an instant he bit his lip and hung\\nirresolute, as if more than half-inclined to retrace his steps. A\\nslight thing decided him--the gaiety of a boy\\'s laugh that\\nfloated from one of the lower rooms and swinging his stick\\nbriskly to add weight to his determination, he ascended the broad\\nsteps and lifted the old brass knocker. A moment later the door\\nwas opened by a large mulatto woman, in a soiled apron, who took\\nhis small hand-bag from him and, when he asked for Mr. Fletcher,\\nled him across the great hall into the unused drawing-room.\\n\\nThe shutters were closed, and as she flung them back on their\\nrusty hinges the pale June twilight entered with the breath of\\nmycrophylla roses. In the scented dusk Carraway stared about the\\ndesolate, crudely furnished room, which gave back to his troubled\\nfancy the face of a pitiable, dishonoured corpse. The soul of it\\nwas gone forever--that peculiar spirit of place which makes every\\nold house the guardian of an inner life--the keeper of a family\\'s\\nghost. What remained was but the outer husk, the disfigured\\nframe, upon which the newer imprint seemed only a passing insult.\\n\\nOn the high wainscoted walls he could still trace the vacant\\ndust-marked squares where the Blake portraits had once\\nhung--lines that the successive scrubbings of fifteen years had\\nnot utterly effaced. A massive mahogany sofa, carved to represent\\na horn of plenty, had been purchased, perhaps at a general sale\\nof the old furniture, with several quaint rosewood chairs and a\\nrare cabinet of inlaid woods. For the rest, the later additions\\nwere uniformly cheap and ill-chosen--a blue plush \"set,\" bought,\\npossibly, at a village store, a walnut table with a sallow marble\\ntop, and several hard engravings of historic subjects.\\n\\nWhen the lawyer turned from a curious inspection of these works\\nof art, he saw that only a curtain of flimsy chintz, stretched\\nbetween a pair of fluted columns, separated him from the\\nadjoining room, where a lamp, with lowered wick, was burning\\nunder a bright red shade. After a moment\\'s hesitation he drew the\\ncurtain aside and entered what he took at once to be the common\\nliving-room of the Fletcher family.\\n\\nHere the effect was less depressing, though equally\\nuninteresting--a paper novel or two on the big Bible upon the\\ntable combined, indeed, with a costly piano in one corner, to\\nstrike a note that was entirely modern. The white crocheted\\ntidies on the chair-backs, elaborated with endless patience out\\nof innumerable spools of darning cotton, lent a feminine touch to\\nthe furniture, which for an instant distracted Carraway\\'s mental\\nvision from the impending personality of Fletcher himself. He\\nremembered now that there was a sister whom he had heard vaguely\\ndescribed by the women of his family as \"quite too hopeless,\" and\\na granddaughter of whom he knew merely that she had for years\\nattended an expensive school somewhere in the North. The grandson\\nhe recalled, after a moment, more distinctly, as a pretty,\\nundeveloped boy in white pinafores, who had once accompanied\\nFletcher upon a hurried visit to the town. The gay laugh had\\nawakened the incident in his mind, and he saw again the little\\ncleanly clad figure perched upon his desk, nibbling bakers\\' buns,\\nwhile he transacted a tedious piece of business with the vulgar\\ngrandfather.\\n\\nHe was toying impatiently with these recollections when his\\nattention was momentarily attracted by the sound of Fletcher\\'s\\nburly tones on the rear porch just beyond the open window.\\n\\n\"I tell you, you\\'ve set all the niggers agin me, and I can\\'t get\\nhands to work the crops.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s your lookout, of course,\" replied a voice, which he\\nassociated at once with young Blake. \"I told you I\\'d work three\\ndays because I wanted the ready money; I\\'ve got it, and my time\\nis my own again.\"\\n\\n\"But I say my tobacco\\'s got to get into the ground this\\nweek--it\\'s too big for the plant-bed a\\'ready, and with three days\\nof this sun the earth\\'ll be dried as hard as a rock.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no doubt of it, I think.\"\\n\\n\"And it\\'s all your blamed fault,\" burst out the other angrily;\\n\"you\\'ve gone and turned them all agin me--white and black alike.\\nWhy, it\\'s as much as I can do to get a stroke of honest labour in\\nthis nigger-ridden country.\"\\n\\nChristopher laughed shortly.\\n\\n\"There is no use blaming the Negroes,\" he said, and his\\npronunciation of the single word would have stamped him in\\nVirginia as of a different class from Fletcher; \"they\\'re usually\\nready enough to work if you treat them decently.\"\\n\\n\"Treat them!\" began Fletcher, and Carraway was about to fling\\nopen the shutters, when light steps passed quickly along the hall\\nand he heard the rustle of a woman\\'s silk dress against the\\nwainscoting.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a stranger to see you, grandfather,\" called a girl\\'s\\neven voice from the house; \"finish paying off the hands and come\\nin at once.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of all the impudence!\" exclaimed the young man, with a\\nsaving dash of humour. Then, without so much as a parting word,\\nhe ran quickly down the steps and started rapidly in the\\ndirection of the darkening road, while the silk dress rustled\\nupon the porch and at the garden gate as the latch was lifted.\\n\\n\"Go in, grandfather!\" called the girl\\'s voice from the garden, to\\nwhich Fletcher responded as decisively.\\n\\n\"For Heaven\\'s sake, let me manage my own affairs, Maria. You seem\\nto have inherited your poor mother\\'s pesky habit of meddling.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I told you a gentleman was waiting,\" returned the girl\\nstubbornly. \"You didn\\'t let us know he was coming, either, and\\nLindy says there isn\\'t a thing fit to eat for supper.\"\\n\\nFletcher snorted, and then, before entering the house, stopped to\\nhaggle with an old Negro woman for a pair of spring chickens\\nhanging dejectedly from her outstretched hand, their feet tied\\ntogether with a strip of faded calico.\\n\\n\"How much you gwine gimme fer dese, marster?\" she inquired\\nanxiously, deftly twirling them about until they swung with heads\\naloft.\\n\\nRising to the huckster\\'s instinct, Fletcher poked the offerings\\nsuspiciously beneath their flapping wings.\\n\\n\"Thirty cents for the pair--not a copper more,\" he responded\\npromptly; \"they\\'re as poor as Job\\'s turkey, both of \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Lawdy, marster, you know better\\'n dat.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re skin and bones, I tell you; feel \\'em yourself. Well,\\ntake it or leave it, thirty cents is all I\\'ll give.\"\\n\\n\"Go \\'way f\\'om yere, suh; dese yer chickings ain\\' no po\\' w\\'ite\\ntrash--dey\\'s been riz on de bes\\' er de lan\\', dey is--en de aigs\\ndey wuz hatched right dar in de middle er de baid whar me en my\\nole man en de chillun sleep.

You ain\\'t fergot how peart I use\\nter wuk w\\'en you wuz over me in ole marster\\'s day. You know you\\nain\\' fergot Mehitable, suh. Ain\\'t you recollect de time ole\\nmarster gimme a dollar wid his own han\\' caze I foun\\' de biggest\\nwum in de hull \\'baccy patch? Lawd! dey wuz times, sho\\'s you bo\\'n.\\nI kin see ole marster now es plain es ef twuz yestiddy, so big en\\nshiny like satin, wid his skin des es tight es a watermillion\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Shut up, confound you!\" cut in Fletcher sharply.\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t stop your chatter I\\'ll set the dogs on you. Shut\\nup, I say!\"\\n\\nHe strode into the house, slamming the heavy door behind him, and\\na moment afterward Carraway heard him scolding brutally at the\\nservants across the hall.\\n\\nThe old Negress had gone muttering from the porch with her unsold\\nchickens, when the door softly opened again, and the girl, who\\nhad entered through the front with her basket of flowers, came\\nout into the growing moonlight.\\n\\n\"Wait a moment, Aunt Mehitable,\" she said. \"I want to speak to\\nyou.\"\\n\\nAunt Mehitable turned slowly, putting a feeble hand to her dazed\\neyes. \"You ain\\' ole miss come back agin, is you, honey?\" she\\nquestioned doubtfully.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who your old miss was,\" replied the girl, \"but I am\\nnot she, whoever she may have been. I am Maria Fletcher. You\\ndon\\'t remember me--yet you used to bake me ash-cakes when I was a\\nlittle girl.\"\\n\\nThe old woman shook her head. \"You ain\\' Marse Fletcher\\'s chile?\"\\n\\n\"His granddaughter--but I must go in to supper. Here is the money\\nfor your chickens--grandpa was only joking; you know he loves to\\njoke. Take the chickens to the hen-house and get something hot to\\neat in the kitchen before you start out again.\"\\n\\nShe ran hurriedly up the steps and entered the hall just as\\nFletcher was shaking hands with his guest.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. Showing that a Little Culture Entails Great Care\\n\\nCarraway had risen to meet his host in a flutter that was almost\\none of dread. In the eight years since their last interview it\\nseemed to him that his mental image of his great client had\\nmagnified in proportions--that Fletcher had \"out-Fletchered\"\\nhimself, as he felt inclined to put it. The old betrayal of his\\nemployer\\'s dependence, which at first had been merely a suspicion\\nin the lawyer\\'s mind, had begun gradually, as time went on, to\\nbristle with the points of significant details. In looking back,\\nhalf-hinted things became clear to him at last, and he gathered,\\nbit by bit, the whole clever, hopeless villainy of the\\nscheme--the crime hedged about by law with all the prating\\nprotection of a virtue. He knew now that Fletcher--the old\\noverseer of the Blake slaves--had defrauded the innocent as\\nsurely as if he had plunged his great red fist into the little\\npocket of a child, had defrauded, indeed, with so strong a blow\\nthat the very consciousness of his victim had been stunned. There\\nhad been about his act all the damning hypocrisy of a great\\ntheft--all the air of stern morality which makes for the popular\\ntriumph of the heroic swindler.\\n\\nThese things Carraway understood, yet as the man strode into the\\nroom with open palm and a general air of bluff hospitality--as if\\nhe had just been blown by some fresh strong wind across his\\ntobacco fields--the lawyer experienced a relief so great that the\\nbreath he drew seemed a fit measure of his earlier foreboding.\\nFor Fletcher outwardly was but the common type of farmer, after\\nall, with a trifle more intelligence, perhaps, than is met with\\nin the average Southerner of his class. \"A plain man but honest,\\nsir,\" was what one expected him to utter at every turn. It was\\nwritten in the coarse open lines of his face, half-hidden by a\\nbushy gray beard; in his small sparkling eyes, now blue, now\\nbrown; in his looselimbed, shambling movements as he crossed the\\nroom. His very clothes spoke, to an acute observer, of a\\nmasculine sincerity naked and unashamed--as if his large\\ncoffee-spotted cravat would not alter the smallest fold to\\nconceal the stains it bore. Hale, hairy, vehement, not without a\\nquality of Rabelaisian humour, he appeared the last of all men\\nwith whom one would associate the burden of a troubled\\nconscience.\\n\\n\"Sorry to have kept you--on my word I am,\" he began heartily;\\n\"but to tell the truth, I thought thar\\'d be somebody in the house\\nwith sense enough to show you to a bedroom. Like to run up now\\nfor a wash before supper?\"\\n\\nIt was what one expected of him, such a speech blurted in so\\noffhand a manner, and the lawyer could barely suppress a\\nthreatening laugh.\\n\\n\"Oh, it was a short trip,\" he returned, \"and a walk of five miles\\non a day like this is one of the most delightful things in life.\\nI\\'ve been looking out at your garden, by the way, and--I may as\\nwell confess it--overhearing a little of your conversation.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" chuckled Fletcher, his great eyebrows overhanging\\nhis eyes like a mustache grown out of place. \"Well, you didn\\'t\\nhear anything to tickle your ears, I reckon. I\\'ve been having a\\nrow with that cantankerous fool, Blake. The queer thing about\\nthese people is that they seem to think I\\'m to blame every time\\nthey see a spot on their tablecloths. Mark my words, it ain\\'t\\nbeen two years since I found that nigger Boaz digging in my\\nasparagus bed, and he told me he was looking for some shoots for\\nole miss\\'s dinner.\"\\n\\n\"The property idea is very strong in these rural counties, you\\nsee,\" remarked the lawyer gravely. \"They feel that every year\\nadds a value to the hereditary possession of land, and that when\\nan estate has borne a single name for a century there has been a\\nveritable impress placed upon it. Your asparagus bed is merely an\\nitem; you find, I fancy, other instances.\"\\n\\nFletcher turned in his chair.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the whole blamed rotten truth,\" he admitted, waving his\\ngreat red hand toward the door; \"but let\\'s have supper first and\\nsettle down to talk on a full stomach. Thar\\'s no hurry with all\\nnight before us, and that, to come to facts, is why I sent for\\nyou. No lawyer\\'s office for me when I want to talk business, but\\nan easy-chair by my own table and a cup of coffee beforehand.\"\\n\\nAs he finished, a bell jangled in the hall, and the door opened\\nto admit the girl whom Carraway had seen a little earlier upon\\nthe porch.\\n\\n\"Supper\\'s a good hour late, Maria,\" grumbled Fletcher, looking at\\nhis heavy silver watch, \"and I smelt the bacon frying at six\\no\\'clock.\"\\n\\nFor an instant the girl looked as if she had more than half an\\nintention to slap his face; then quickly recovering her\\nself-possession, she smiled at Carraway and held out a small\\nwhite hand with an air of quiet elegance which was the most\\nnoticeable thing in her appearance.\\n\\n\"I am quite a stranger to you, Mr. Carraway,\" she said, with a\\nlaugh, \"but if you had only known it, I had a doll named after\\nyou when I was very small. Guy Carraway!--it seemed to me all\\nthat was needed to make a fairy tale.\"\\n\\nThe lawyer joined in her laugh, which never rose above a\\ncarefully modulated minor. \"I confess that I once took the same\\nview of it, my dear young lady,\" he returned, \"so I ended by\\ndropping the name and keeping only the initial. Your grandfather\\nwill tell you that I am now G. Carraway and nothing more. I\\ncouldn\\'t afford, as things were, to make a fairy tale of my life,\\nyou see.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, if one only could!\" said the girl, lowering her full dark\\neyes, which gave a piteous lie to her sullen mouth.\\n\\nShe was artificial, Carraway told himself with emphasis, and yet\\nthe distinction of manner--the elegance--was certainly the point\\nat which her training had not failed. He felt it in her tall,\\nstraight figure, absurdly overdressed for a granddaughter of\\nFletcher\\'s; in her smooth white hands, with their finely polished\\nnails; in her pale, repressed face, which he called plain while\\nadmitting that it might become interesting; in her shapely head\\neven with its heavy cable of coal-black hair.\\n\\nWhat she was her education had made of her--the look of serene\\ndistinction, the repose of her thin-featured, colourless face,\\nrefined beyond the point of prettiness--these things her training\\nhad given her, and these were the things which Carraway, with his\\nold-fashioned loyalty to a strong class prejudice, found himself\\nalmost resenting. Bill Fletcher\\'s granddaughter had, he felt, no\\nright to this rare security of breeding which revealed itself in\\nevery graceful fold of the dress she wore, for with Fletcher an\\nhonest man she would have been, perhaps, but one of the sallow,\\nover-driven drudges who stare like helpless effigies from the\\nlittle tumbledown cabins along country roadsides.\\n\\nFletcher, meanwhile, had filled in the pause with one of his\\nsudden burly dashes into speech.\\n\\n\"Maria has been so long at her high-and-mighty boarding-school,\"\\nhe said, \"that I reckon her head\\'s as full of fancies as a cheese\\nis of maggots. She\\'s even got a notion that she wants to turn out\\nall this new stuff--to haul the old rubbish back again but I say\\nwait till the boy comes on--then we\\'ll see, we\\'ll see.\"\\n\\n\"And in the meantime we\\'ll go in to supper,\" put in the girl with\\na kind of hopeless patience, though Carraway could see that she\\nsmarted as from a blow. \"This is Will, Mr. Carraway,\" she added\\nalmost gaily, skillfully sweeping her train from about the feet\\nof\\na pretty, undersized boy of fourteen years, who had burst into\\nthe room with his mouth full of bread and jam. \"He\\'s quite the\\npride of the family, you know, because he\\'s just taken all the\\nhonours of his school.\"\\n\\n\"History, \\'rithmatic, Latin--all the languages,\" rolled out\\nFletcher in a voice that sounded like a tattoo. \"I can\\'t keep up\\nwith \\'em, but they\\'re all thar, ain\\'t they, sonny?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you could never say \\'em off straight, grandpa,\" retorted the\\nboy, with the pertness of a spoiled girl, at which, to Carraway\\'s\\nsurprise, Fletcher fairly chuckled with delight.\\n\\n\"That\\'s so; I\\'m a plain man, the Lord knows,\" he admitted, his\\ncoarse face crinkling like a sundried leaf of tobacco.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got chickens for supper--broiled,\" the boy chattered on,\\nputting out his tongue at his sister; \"that\\'s why Lindy\\'s havin\\'\\nit an hour late she\\'s been picking \\'em, with Aunt Mehitable\\nhelping her for the feathers. Now don\\'t shake your head at me,\\nMaria, because it\\'s no use pretending we have \\'em every night,\\nlike old Mrs. Blake.\"\\n\\n\"Bless my soul!\" gasped Fletcher, nettled by the last remark. \"Do\\nyou mean to tell me those Blakes are fools enough to eat spring\\nchicken when they could get forty cents apiece for \\'em in the\\nopen market?\"\\n\\n\"The old lady does,\" corrected the boy glibly. \"The one who wears\\nthe queer lace cap and sits in the big chair by the hearth all\\nday--and all night, too, Tommy Spade says, \\'cause he peeped\\nthrough once at midnight and she was still there, sitting so\\nstiff that it scared him and he ran away. Well, Aunt Mehitable\\nsold her a dozen, and she got a side of bacon and a bag of meal.\"\\n\\n\"Grandfather, you\\'ve forgotten Aunt Saidie,\" broke in Maria, as\\nFletcher was about to begin his grace without waiting for a dumpy\\nlittle woman, in purple calico, who waddled with an embarrassed\\nair from her hasty preparations in the pantry. At first Carraway\\nhad mistaken her for an upper servant, but as she came forward\\nMaria laid her hand playfully upon her arm and introduced her\\nwith a sad little gaiety of manner. \"I believe she has met one of\\nyour sisters in Fredericksburg,\" she added, after a moment.\\nClearly she had determined to accept the family in the lump, with\\na resolution that--had it borne less resemblance to a passive\\nrage could not have failed to glorify a nobler martyrdom. It was\\nnot affection that fortified her--beyond her first gently\\ntolerant glance at the boy there had been only indifference in\\nher pale, composed face--and the lawyer was at last brought to\\nthe surprising conclusion that Fletcher\\'s granddaughter was\\nseeking to build herself a fetish of the mere idle bond of blood.\\nThe hopeless gallantry of the girl moved him to a vague feeling\\nof pity, and he spoke presently with a chivalrous desire of\\nmaking her failure easy.\\n\\n\"It was Susan, I think,\" he said pleasantly, shaking hands with\\nthe squat little figure in front of him, \"I remember her speaking\\nof it afterward.\"\\n\\n\"I met her at a church festival one Christmas Eve,\" responded\\nAunt Saidie, in a high-pitched, rasping voice. \"The same evening\\nthat I got this pink crocheted nuby.\" She touched a small pointed\\nshawl about her shoulders. \"Miss Belinda Beale worked it and it\\nwas raffled off for ten cents a chance.\"\\n\\nHer large, plump face, overflushed about the nose, had a natural\\nkindliness of expression which Carraway found almost appealing;\\nand he concluded that as a girl she might have possessed a common\\nprettiness of feature. Above her clear blue eyes a widening\\nparting divided her tightly crimped bands of hair, which still\\nshowed a bright chestnut tint in the gray ripples.\\n\\n\"Thar, thar, Saidie,\" Fletcher interrupted with a frank\\nbrutality, which the lawyer found more repelling than the memory\\nof his stolen fortune. \"Mr. Carraway doesn\\'t want to hear about\\nyour fascinator. He\\'d a long ways rather have you make his\\ncoffee.\"\\n\\nThe little woman flushed purple and drew back her chair with an\\nugly noise from the head of the lavishly spread table.\\n\\n\"Set down right thar, suh,\" she stammered, her poor little\\npretense of ease gone from her, \"right thar between Brother Bill\\nand me.\"\\n\\n\"You did say it, Aunt Saidie, I told you you would,\" screamed the\\npert boy, beginning an assault upon an enormous dish of\\nbatterbread.\\n\\nMaria flinched visibly. \"Be silent, Will,\" she ordered.\\n\"Grandfather, you must really make Will learn to be polite.\"\\n\\n\"Now, now, Maria, you\\'re too hard on us,\" protested Fletcher,\\nflinging himself bodily into the breach, \"boys will be boys, you\\nknow--they warn\\'t born gals.\"\\n\\n\"But she did say it, Maria,\" insisted the boy, \"and she bet me a\\nwhole dish of doughnuts she wouldn\\'t. She did say \\'set\\'; I heard\\nher.\" Maria bit her lip, and her flashing eyes filled with angry\\ntears, while Carraway, as he began talking hurriedly about the\\npromise of tobacco, resisted valiantly an impulse to kick the\\npretty boy beneath the table. As his eyes traveled about the\\nfine old room, marking its mellow wainscoting and the whitened\\nsilver handles on the heavy doors, he found himself wondering\\nwith implacable approval if this might not be the beginning of a\\ngreat atonement.\\n\\nThe boy\\'s mood had varied at the sight of his sister\\'s tears, and\\nhe fell to patting penitently the hand that quivered on the\\ntable. \"You needn\\'t give me the doughnuts, Aunt Saidie; I\\'ll make\\nbelieve you didn\\'t say it,\" he whispered at last.\\n\\n\"Do you take sugar, Mr. Carraway?\" asked Miss Saidie, flushed and\\ntremulous at the head of the overcrowded table, with its massive\\nmodern silver service. Poor little woman, thought the lawyer,\\nwith his first positive feeling of sympathy, she would have been\\nhappier frying her own bacon amid bouncing children in a\\nlabourer\\'s cabin. He leaned toward her, speaking with a grave\\ncourtesy, which she met with the frightened, questioning eyes of\\na child. She was \"quite too hopeless,\" he reluctantly admitted\\n--yet, despite himself, he felt a sudden stir of honest human\\ntenderness--the tenderness he had certainly not felt for\\nFletcher, nor for the pretty, pert boy, nor even for the elegant\\nMaria herself.\\n\\n\"I was looking out at the dear old garden awhile ago,\" he said,\\n\"and I gathered from it that you must be fond of flowers--since\\nyour niece tells me she has been away so long.\"\\n\\nShe brightened into animation, her broad, capable hands fumbling\\nwith the big green-and-gold teacups.\\n\\n\"Yes, I raise \\'em,\" she answered. \"Did you happen to notice the\\nbed of heartsease? I worked every inch of that myself last\\nspring--and now I\\'m planting zinnias, and touch-me-nots, and\\nsweet-williams they\\'ll all come along later.\"\\n\\n\"And prince\\'s-feather,\" added the lawyer, reminiscently; \"that\\nused to be a favourite of mine, I remember, when I was a country\\nlad.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got a whole border of \\'em out at the back large, fine\\nplants, too--but Maria wants to root \\'em up. She says they\\'re\\nvulgar because they grow in all the niggers\\' yards.\"\\n\\n\"Vulgar!\" So this was the measure of Maria, Carraway told\\nhimself, as he fell into his pleasant ridicule. \"Why, if God\\nAlmighty ever created a vulgar flower, my dear young lady, I have\\nyet to see it.\"\\n\\n\"But don\\'t you think it just a little gaudy for a lawn,\"\\nsuggested the girl, easily stung to the defensive.\\n\\n\"It looks cheerful and I like it,\" insisted Aunt Saidie,\\nemboldened by a rare feeling of support. \"Ma used to have two big\\ngreen tubs of it on either side the front door when we were\\nchildren, and we used to stick it in our hats and play we was\\nreal fine folks. Don\\'t you recollect it, Brother Bill?\"\\n\\n\"Good Lord, Saidie, the things you do recollect!\" exclaimed\\nFletcher, who, beneath the agonised eyes of Maria, was drinking\\nhis coffee from his saucer in great spluttering gulps.\\n\\nThe girl was in absolute torture: this Carraway saw in the white,\\nstrained, nervous intensity of her look; yet the knowledge served\\nonly to irritate him, so futile appeared any attempt to soften\\nthe effect of Fletcher\\'s grossness. Before the man\\'s colossal\\nvulgarity of soul, mere brutishness of manner seemed but a\\ntrifling phase.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. Of Human Nature in the Raw State\\n\\nWhen at last the pickles and preserved watermelon rind had been\\npresented with a finishing flourish, and Carraway had\\nsuccessfully resisted Miss Saidie\\'s final passionate insistence\\nin the matter of the big blackberry roll before her, Fletcher\\nnoisily pushed back his chair, and, with a careless jerk of his\\nthumb in the direction of his guest, stamped across the hall into\\nthe family sitting-room.\\n\\n\"Now we\\'ll make ourselves easy and fall to threshing things out,\"\\nhe remarked, filling a blackened brier-root pipe, into the bowl\\nof which he packed the tobacco with his stubby forefinger. \"Yes,\\nI\\'m a lover of the weed, you see--don\\'t you smoke or chaw, suh?\"\\n\\nCarraway shook his head. \"When I was young and wanted to I\\ncouldn\\'t,\" he explained, \"and now that I am old and can I have\\nunfortunately ceased to want to. I\\'ve passed the time of life\\nwhen a man begins a habit merely for the sake of its being a\\nhabit.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon you\\'re wise as things go, though for my part I\\nbelieve I took to the weed before I did to my mother\\'s breast. I\\ncut my first tooth on a plug, she used to say.\"\\n\\nHe threw himself into a capacious cretonne-covered chair, and,\\nkicking his carpet slippers from him, sat swinging one massive\\nfoot in its gray yarn sock. Through the thickening smoke Carraway\\nwatched the complacency settle over his great hairy face.\\n\\n\"And now, to begin with the beginning, what do you think of my\\ngrandchildren?\" he demanded abruptly, taking his pipe from his\\nmouth after a long, sucking breath, and leaning forward with his\\nelbow on the arm of his chair.\\n\\nThe other hesitated. \"You\\'ve done well by them, I should say.\"\\n\\n\"A fine pair, eh?\"\\n\\n\"The admission is easy.\"\\n\\n\"Look at the gal, now,\" burst out Fletcher impulsively. \"Would\\nyou fancy, to see her stepping by, that her grandfather used to\\ncrack the whip over a lot of dirty niggers?\" He drove the fact in\\nsquarely with big, sure blows of his fist, surveying it with an\\nenthusiasm the other found amazing. \"Would you fancy, even,\" he\\ncontinued after a moment, \"that her father warn\\'t as good as I\\nam--that he left overseeing to jine the army, and came out to\\nturn blacksmith if I hadn\\'t kept him till he drank himself to\\ndeath? His wife? Why, the woman couldn\\'t read her own name unless\\nyou printed it in letters as long as your finger--and now jest\\nturn and look at Maria!\" he wound up in a puff of smoke.\\n\\n\"The girl\\'s wonderful,\" admitted Carraway. \"She\\'s like a\\ndressed-up doll-baby, too; all the natural thing has been\\nsqueezed out of her, and she\\'s stuffed with sawdust.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity she ain\\'t a little better looking in the face,\"\\npursued Fletcher, waving the criticism aside. \"She\\'s a plagued\\nsight too pale and squinched-up for my taste--for all her fine\\nair. I like \\'em red and juicy, and though you won\\'t believe me,\\nmost likely she can\\'t hold a tallow candle to what Saidie was\\nwhen she was young. But then, Saidie never had her chance, and\\nMaria\\'s had \\'em doubled over. Why, she left home as soon as she\\'d\\ndone sucking, and she hasn\\'t spent a single summer here since she\\nwas eight years old. Small thanks I\\'ll get for it, I reckon, but\\nI\\'ve done a fair turn by Maria.\"\\n\\n\"The boy comes next, I suppose?\" Carraway broke in, watching the\\nother\\'s face broaden into a big, purple smile.\\n\\n\"Ah, thar you\\'re right--it\\'s the boy I\\'ve got my eye on now. His\\nname\\'s the same as mine, you know, and I reckon one day William\\nFletcher\\'ll make his mark among the quality. He\\'ll have it all,\\ntoo--the house, the land, everything, except a share of the money\\nwhich goes to the gal. It\\'ll make her childbearing easier, I\\nreckon, and for my part, that\\'s the only thing a woman\\'s fit for.\\nDon\\'t talk to me about a childless woman! Why, I\\'d as soon keep a\\ncow that wouldn\\'t calve.\\n\\n\"You were speaking of the boy, I believe,\" coolly interrupted\\nCarraway. To a man of his old-fashioned chivalric ideal the\\nbrutal allusion to the girl was like a deliberate blow in the\\nface.\\n\\n\"So I was--so I was. Well, he\\'s to have it all, I say--every\\nmite, and welcome. I\\'ve had a pretty tough life in my time--you\\ncan tell it from my hands, suh--but I ain\\'t begrudging it if it\\nleaves the boy a bit better off. Lord, thar\\'s many and many a\\nnight,when I was little and my stepfather kicked me out of doors\\nwithout a bite, that I used to steal into somebody or other\\'s\\ncow-shed and snuggle for warmth into the straw--yes, and suck the\\nudders of the cows for food, too. Oh, I\\'ve had a hard enough\\nlife, for all the way it looks now--and I\\'m not saying that if\\nthe choice was mine I\\'d go over it agin even as it stands to-day.\\nWe\\'re set here for better or for worse, that\\'s my way of\\nthinking, and if thar\\'s any harm comes of it Providence has got\\nto take a share of the blame.\"\\n\\n\"Hardly the preacher\\'s view of the matter, is it?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe not; and I ain\\'t got a quarrel with \\'em, the Lord knows. I\\ngo to church like clockwork, and pay my pew-rent, too, which is\\nmore than some do that gabble the most about salvation. If I pay\\nfor the preacher\\'s keep it\\'s only fair that I should get some of\\nthe good that comes to him hereafter; that\\'s how it looks to me;\\nso I don\\'t trouble my head much about the ins and the outs of\\ngetting saved or damned. I\\'ve never puled in this world, thank\\nGod, and let come what will, I ain\\'t going to begin puling in the\\nnext. But to go back to whar I started from, it all makes in the\\nend for that pretty little chap over yonder in the dining-room.\\nRather puny for his years now, but as sound as a nut, and he\\'ll\\ngrow, he\\'ll grow. When his mother--poor, worthless drab--gave\\nbirth to him and died, I told her it was the best day\\'s work\\nshe\\'d ever done.\"\\n\\nCarraway\\'s humour rippled over. \"It\\'s easy to imagine what her\\nanswer must have been to such a pleasantry,\" he observed.\\n\\n\"Oh, she was a fool, that woman--a born fool!\\n\\nHer answer was that it would be the best day for her only when I\\ncame to call it the worst. She hated me a long sight more than\\nshe hated the devil, and if she was to rise out of her grave\\nto-day she\\'d probably start right in scrubbing for those darned\\nBlakes.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Carraway.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the plain truth, but I don\\'t visit it on the little lad.\\nWhy should I? He\\'s got my name--I saw to that--and mark my word,\\nhe\\'ll grow up yet to marry among the quality.\"\\n\\nThe secret was out at last--Fletcher\\'s purpose was disclosed, and\\neven in the strong light of his past misdeeds it showed not\\nwithout a hint of pathos. The very renouncement of any personal\\nambition served to invest the racial one with a kind of grandeur.\\n\\n\"There\\'s evidently an enviable career before him,\" said the\\nlawyer at the end of a long pause, \"and this brings me, by the\\nway, to the question I wish to as--had your desire to see me any\\nconnection with the prospects of your grandson?\"\\n\\n\"In a way, yes; though, to tell the truth, it has more to do with\\nthat young Blake\\'s. He\\'s been bothering me a good deal of late,\\nand I mean to have it square with him before Bill Fletcher\\'s a\\nyear older.\"\\n\\n\"No difficulty about your title to the estate, I presume?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Lord, no; that\\'s all fair and square, suh. I bought the\\nplace, you know, when it went at auction jest a few years after\\nthe war. I bought and paid for it right down, and that settled\\nthings for good and all.\"\\n\\nCarraway considered the fact for a moment. \"If I remember\\ncorrectly--I mean unless gossip went very far afield--the place\\nbrought exactly seven thousand dollars.\" His gaze plunged into\\nthe moonlight beyond the open window and followed the clear sweep\\nof the distant fields. \"Seven thousand dollars,\" he added softly;\\n\"and there\\'s not a finer in Virginia.\"\\n\\n\"Thar was nobody to bid agin me, you see,\" explained Fletcher\\neasily. \"The old gentleman was as poor as Job\\'s turkey then,\\nbesides going doty mighty fast.\"\\n\\n\"The common report was, I believe,\" pursued the lawyer, \"that the\\nold man himself did not know of the place being for sale until he\\nheard the auctioneer\\'s hammer on the lawn, and that his mind left\\nhim from the moment--this was, of course, mere idle talk.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'ll hear anything,\" snorted Fletcher. \"The old gentleman\\nhadn\\'t a red copper to his name, and if he couldn\\'t pay the\\nmortgages, how under heaven could he have bought in the place? As\\na plain man I put the question.\"\\n\\n\"But his friends? Where were his friends, I wonder? In his youth\\nhe was one of the most popular men in the State--a high liver and\\ngood toaster, you remember--and later on he stood well in the\\nConfederate Government. That he should have fallen into abject\\npoverty seems really incomprehensible.\"\\n\\nFletcher twisted in his chair. \"Why, that was jest three years\\nafter the war, I tell you,\" he said with irritable emphasis; \"he\\nhadn\\'t a friend this side of Jordan, I reckon, who could have\\nraised fifty cents to save his soul. The quality were as bad off\\nas thar own niggers.\\n\\n\"True--true,\" admitted Carraway; \"but the surprising thing is--I\\ndon\\'t hesitate to say--that you who had been overseer to the\\nBlakes for twenty years should have been able in those destitute\\ntimes and on the spot, as it were, to put down seven thousand\\ndollars.\"\\n\\nHe faced the fact unflinchingly, dragging it from the long\\nobscurity full into the red glare of the lamplight. Here was the\\nmain thing, he knew, in Fletcher\\'s history--here was the supreme\\noffense. For twenty years the man had been the trusted servant of\\nhis feeble employer, and when the final crash came he had risen\\nwith full hands from the wreck. The prodigal Blakes--burning the\\ncandle at both ends, people said--had squandered a double fortune\\nbefore the war, and in an equally stupendous fashion Fletcher had\\namassed one.\\n\\n\"Oh, thar\\'re ways and ways of putting by a penny,\" he now\\nprotested, \"and I turned over a bit during the war, I may as well\\nown up, though folks had only black looks for speculators then.\"\\n\\n\"We used to call them \\'bloodsuckers,\\' I remember.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s neither here nor thar, suh. When the place went for\\nseven thousand I paid it down, and I\\'ve managed one way and\\nanother--and in spite of the pesky niggers--to make a pretty bit\\nout of the tobacco crop, hard as times have been. The Hall is\\nmine now, thar\\'s no going agin that, and, so help me God, it\\'ll\\nbelong to a William Fletcher long after I am dead.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that brings us directly to the point.\"\\n\\nFletcher squared himself about in his chair while his pipe went\\nout slowly.\\n\\n\"The point, if you\\'ll have it straight,\" he said, \"is jest\\nthis--I want the whole place--every inch of it--and I\\'ll die or\\ngit it, as sure\\'s my name\\'s my own. Thar\\'s still that old frame\\nhouse and the piece of land tacked to it, whar the overseers used\\nto live, cutting straight into the heart of my tobacco fields--in\\nclear view of the Hall, too--right in the middle of my land, I\\ntell you!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see--I see,\" muttered Carraway; \"that\\'s the little farm in\\nthe midst of the estate which the old gentleman--bless his weak\\nhead and strong heart gave his wife\\'s brother, Colonel Corbin,\\nwho came back crippled from the war. Yes, I remember now, there\\nwas a joke at the time about his saying that land was the\\ncheapest present he could give.\"\\n\\n\"It was all his besotted foolishness, you know to think of a sane\\nman deeding away seventy acres right in the heart of his tract of\\ntwo thousand. He meant it for a joke, of course. Mr. Tucker or\\nColonel Corbin, if you choose, was like one of the family, but he\\nwas as sensitive as a kid about his wounds, and he wanted to live\\noff somewhar, shut up by himself. Well, he\\'s got enough folks\\nabout him now, the Lord knows. Thar\\'s the old lady, and the two\\ngals, and Mr. Christopher, to say nothing of Uncle Boaz and a\\nwhole troop of worthless niggers that are eating him out of house\\nand home. Tom Spade has a deed of trust on the place for three\\nhundred dollars; he told me so himself.\"\\n\\n\"So I understand; and all this is a serious inconvenience to you,\\nI may suppose.\"\\n\\n\"Inconvenience! Blood and thunder! It takes the heart right out\\nof my land, I tell you. Why, the very road I cut to save myself\\nhalf a mile of mudholes came to a dead stop because Mr.\\nChristopher wouldn\\'t let it cross his blamed pasture.\"\\n\\nCarraway thoughtfully regarded his finger nails. \"Then, bless my\\nsoul!--seeing it\\'s your private affair--what are you going to do\\nabout it?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Git it. The devil knows how--I don\\'t; but git it I will. I\\nbrought you down here to talk those fools over, and I mean you to\\ndo it. It\\'s all spite, pure, rotten spite; that\\'s what it is.\\nLook here, I\\'ll gladly give \\'em three thousand dollars for that\\nstrip of land, and it wouldn\\'t bring nine hundred, on my oath!\"\\n\\n\"Have you made the offer?\"\\n\\n\"Made it? Why, if I set foot on the tip edge of that land I\\'d\\nhave every lean hound in the pack snapping at my heels. As for\\nthat young rascal, he\\'d knock me down if I so much as scented the\\nmatter.\"\\n\\nHe rapped his pipe sharply on the wood of his chair and a little\\npile of ashes settled upon the floor. With a laugh, the other\\nwaved his hand in protest.\\n\\n\"So you prefer to make the proposition by proxy. My dear sir--I\\'m\\nnot a rubber ball.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he won\\'t hurt you. It would spoil the sport to punch\\nanybody\\'s head but mine, you know. Come, now, isn\\'t it a fair\\noffer I\\'m making?\"\\n\\n\"It appears so, certainly--and I really do not see why he should\\nwish to hold the place. It isn\\'t worth much, I fancy, to anybody\\nbut the owner of the Hall, and with the three thousand clear he\\ncould probably get a much better one at a little distance--with\\nthe additional value of putting a few square miles between\\nhimself and you--whom, I may presume, he doesn\\'t love.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you may presume he hates me if you\\'ll only work it,\" snorted\\nFletcher. \"Go over thar boldly--no slinking, mind you--to-morrow\\nmorning, and talk them into reason. Lord, man, you ought to be\\nable to do it--don\\'t you know Greek?\"\\n\\nCarraway nodded. \"Not that it ever availed me much in an\\nargument,\" he confessed frankly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good thing to stop a mouth with, anyway. Thar\\'s many and\\nmany a time, I tell you, I\\'ve lost a bargain for the lack of a\\nfew rags of Latin or Greek. Drag it in; stuff it down \\'em; gag\\nthar mouths--it\\'s better than all the swearing under heaven. Why,\\ntaking the Lord\\'s name in vain ain\\'t nothing to a line of poetry\\nspurted of a sudden in one of them dead-and-gone languages. It\\'s\\nbeen done at me, suh, and I know how it works--that\\'s why I\\'ve\\nput the boy upstairs on \\'em from the start. \\'Tain\\'t much matter\\nwhether he goes far in his own tongue or not, that\\'s what I said,\\nbut dose him well with something his neighbours haven\\'t learnt.\"\\n\\nHe rose with a lurch, laid his pipe on the mantel, and drew out\\nhis big silver watch.\\n\\n\"Great Jehosaphat! it\\'s eleven and after,\" he exclaimed. \"Well,\\nit\\'s time for us to turn in, I reckon, and dream of breakfast. If\\nyou\\'ll hold the lamp while I bolt up, I\\'ll show you to your\\nroom.\"\\n\\nCarraway picked up the lamp, and, cautiously following his host\\ninto the darkened hall, waited until he had fastened the\\nnight-chains and shot the heavy bolts.\\n\\n\"If you want a drink of water thar\\'s a bucket in the porch,\" said\\nFletcher, as he opened the back door and reached out into the\\nmoonlight. \"Wait thar a second and I\\'ll hand you the dipper.\"\\n\\nHe stepped out upon the porch, and a moment later Carraway heard\\na heavy stumble followed by a muttered oath.\\n\\n\"Why, blast the varmints! I\\'ve upset the boy\\'s cage of white mice\\nand they\\'re skedaddling about my legs. Here! hold the lamp, will\\nyou--I\\'m squashing a couple of \\'em under each of my hands.\"\\n\\nCarraway, leaning out with the lamp, which drew a brilliant\\ncircle on the porch, saw Fletcher floundering helplessly upon his\\nhands and knees in the midst of the fleeing family of mice.\\n\\n\"They\\'re a plagued mess of beasts, that\\'s what they are,\" he\\nexclaimed, \"but the little lad sets a heap of store by \\'em, and\\nwhen he comes down tomorrow he\\'ll find that I got some of \\'em\\nback, anyway.\"\\n\\nHe fastened the cage and placed it carefully beneath the bench.\\nThen, closing and bolting the door, he took the lamp from\\nCarraway and motioned him up the dusky staircase to the spare\\nchamber at the top.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. The Wreck of the Blakes\\n\\nWhen Christopher left Blake Hall, he swung vigorously in the\\ntwilight across the newly ploughed fields, until, at the end of a\\nfew minutes\\' walk, he reached the sunken road that branched off\\nby the abandoned ice-pond. Here the bullfrogs were still croaking\\nhoarsely, and far away over the gray-green rushes a dim moon was\\nmounting the steep slope of bluish sky.\\n\\nThe air was fresh with the scent of the upturned earth, and the\\nclosing day refined into a tranquil beauty; but the young man, as\\nhe passed briskly, did not so much as draw a lengthened breath,\\nand when presently the cry of a whip-poor-will floated from the\\nold rail fence, he fell into a whistling mockery of the plaintive\\nnotes. The dogs at his heels started a rabbit once from the close\\ncover of the underbrush, and he called them to order in a sharp,\\nperemptory tone. Not until he reached the long, whitewashed gate\\nopening before the frame house of the former overseers did he\\nbreak the easy swing of his accustomed stride.\\n\\nThe house, a common country dwelling of the sort used by the\\npoorer class of farmers, lost something of its angularity beneath\\nthe moonlight, and even the half-dried garments, spread after the\\nday\\'s washing on the bent old rose-bushes, shone in soft white\\npatches amid the grass, which looked thick and fine under the\\nheavy dew. In one corner of the yard there was a spreading\\npeach-tree, on which the shriveled little peaches ripened out of\\nseason, and against the narrow porch sprawled a gray and crippled\\naspen, where a flock of turkeys had settled to roost along its\\ntwisted boughs.\\n\\nIn one of the lower rooms a lamp was burning, and as Christopher\\ncrunched heavily along the pebbled path, a woman with a piece of\\nsewing in her hand came into the hall and spoke his name.\\n\\n\"Christopher, you are late.\"\\n\\nHer voice was deep and musical, with a richness of volume which\\nraised deluding hopes of an impassioned beauty in the\\nspeaker--who, as she crossed the illumined square of the\\nwindow-frame, showed as a tall, thin woman of forty years, with\\nsquinting eyes, and a face whose misshapen features stood out\\nlike the hasty drawing for a grotesque. When she reached him\\nChristopher turned from the porch, and they walked together\\nslowly out into the moonlight, passing under the aspen where the\\nturkeys stirred and fluttered in their sleep.\\n\\n\"Has her cat come home, Cynthia?\" were the young man\\'s first\\nanxious words.\\n\\n\"About sunset. Uncle Boaz found her over at Aunt Daphne\\'s,\\nhunting mice under the joists. Mother had fretted terribly over\\nthe loss.\"\\n\\n\"Is she easier now?\"\\n\\n\"Much more so, but she still asks for the port. We pretend that\\nUncle Boaz has mislaid the key of the wine-cellar. She upbraided\\nhim, and he bore it so patiently, poor old soul!\"\\n\\nChristopher quickly reached into the deep pocket of his overalls\\nand drew out the scanty wages of his last three days\\' labour.\\n\\n\"Send this by somebody down to Tompkins,\" he said, \"and get the\\nwine he ordered. He refuses to sell on credit any longer, so I\\nhad to find the money.\"\\n\\nShe looked up, startled.\\n\\n\"Oh, Christopher, you have worked for Fletcher?\"\\n\\nTears shone in her eyes and her mouth quivered. \"Oh,\\nChristopher!\" she repeated, and the emotional quality in her\\nvoice rang strong and true. He fell back, angered, while the hand\\nshe had stretched out dropped limply to her side.\\n\\n\"For God\\'s sake, don\\'t snivel,\" he retorted harshly. \"Send the\\nmoney and give her the wine, but dole it out like a miser, for\\nwhere the next will come from is more than I can tell.\"\\n\\n\"The pay for my sewing is due in three days,\" said Cynthia,\\nraising her roughened hand on which the needle-scars showed even\\nin the moonlight. \"Mother has worried so to-day that I couldn\\'t\\nwork except at odd moments, but I can easily manage to sit up\\nto-night and get it done. She thinks I\\'m embroidering an ottoman,\\nyou see, and this evening she asked to feel the silks.\"\\n\\nHe uttered a savage exclamation.\\n\\n\"Oh, I gave her some ravellings from an old tidy,\" she hastened\\nto assure him. \"She played with them awhile and knew no better,\\nas I told her the colours one by one. Afterward she planned all\\nkinds of samplers and fire-screens that I might work. Her own\\nknitting has wearied her of late, so we haven\\'t been obliged to\\nbuy the yarn.\"\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t suspect, you think?\"\\n\\nCynthia shook her head. \"After fifteen years of deception there\\'s\\nno danger of my telling the truth to-day. I only wish I could,\"\\nshe added, with that patient dignity which is the outward\\nexpression of complete renouncement. When she lifted her tragic\\nface the tears on her cheeks softened the painful hollows, as the\\nmoonbeams, playing over her gown of patched and faded silk,\\nrevived for a moment the freshness of its discoloured flowers.\\n\\n\"The truth would be the death of her,\" said the young man, in a\\nbitter passion of anxiety. \"Tell her that Fletcher owns the Hall,\\nand that for fifteen years she has lived, blind and paralysed, in\\nthe overseer\\'s house! Why, I\\'d rather stick a knife into her\\nheart myself!\"\\n\\n\"Her terrible pride would kill her--yes, you\\'re right. We\\'ll keep\\nit up to the end at any cost.\"\\n\\nHe turned to her with a sudden terror in his face. \"She isn\\'t\\nworse, is she?\"\\n\\n\"Worse? Oh, no; I only meant the cost to us, the cost of never\\nspeaking the truth within the house.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not afraid of lying, God knows,\" he answered, in the\\ntone of one from whom a burden has been removed. \"I\\'m only\\nwondering how much longer I\\'ll be able to afford the luxury.\"\\n\\n\"But we\\'re no worse off than usual, that\\'s one comfort. Mother is\\nquite happy now since Beulah has been found, and the only added\\nworry is that Aunt Dinah is laid up in her cabin and we\\'ve had to\\nsend her soup. Uncle Isam has come to see you, by the way. I\\nbelieve he wants you to give him some advice about his little hut\\nup in the woods, and to look up his birth in the servants\\'\\nage-book, too. He lives five miles away, you know, and works\\nacross the river at Farrar\\'s Mills.\"\\n\\n\"Uncle Isam!\" exclaimed Christopher, wonderingly; \"why, what do I\\nknow about the man? I haven\\'t laid eyes on him for the last ten\\nyears.\"\\n\\n\"But he wants help now, so of course he\\'s come to you, and as\\nhe\\'s walked all the distance--equally of course--he\\'ll stay to\\nsupper. Mother has her young chicken, and there\\'s bacon and\\ncornbread for the rest of us, so I hope the poor man won\\'t go\\nback hungry. Ever since Aunt Polly\\'s chimney blew down she has\\nhad to fry the middling in the kitchen, and mother complains so\\nof the smell. She can\\'t understand why we have it three times a\\nday, and when I told her that Uncle Tucker acquired the habit in\\nthe army, she remarked that it was very inconsiderate of him to\\ninsist upon gratifying so extraordinary a taste.\"\\n\\nChristopher laughed shortly.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a muck of a world,\" he declared cheerfully, taking\\noff his coarse harvest hat and running his hand through his\\nclustering fair hair. In the mellow light the almost brutal\\nstrength of his jaw was softened, and his sunburned face paled to\\nthe beauty of some ancient ivory carving. Cynthia, gazing up at\\nhim, caught her breath with a sob.\\n\\n\"How big you are, and strong! How fit for any life in the world\\nbut this!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t whimper,\" he responded roughly, adding, after a moment,\\n\"Precious fit for anything but the stable or the tobacco field!\\nWhy, I couldn\\'t so much as write a decently spelled letter to\\nsave my soul. A darky asked me yesterday to read a postbill for\\nhim down at the store, and I had to skip a big word in the first\\nline.\"\\n\\nHe made his confession defiantly, with a certain boorish pride in\\nhis ignorance and his degradation.\\n\\n\"My dear, my dear, I wanted to teach you--I will teach you now.\\nWe will read together.\"\\n\\n\"And let mother and Uncle Tucker plough the field, and plant the\\ncrop, and cut the wood. No, it won\\'t answer; your learning would\\ndo me no good, and I don\\'t want it--I told you that when you\\nfirst took me from my study and put me to do all the chores upon\\nthe place.\"\\n\\n\"I take you! Oh, Christopher, what could we do? Uncle Tucker was\\na hopeless cripple, there wasn\\'t a servant strong enough to spade\\nthe garden, and there were only Lila and you and I.\"\\n\\n\"And I was ten. Well, I\\'m not blaming you, and I\\'ve done what I\\nwas forced to--but keep your confounded books out of my sight,\\nthat\\'s all I ask. Is that mother calling?\"\\n\\nCynthia bent her ear. \"I thought Lila was with her, but I\\'ll go\\nat once. Be sure to change your clothes, dear, before she touches\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t I better chop a little kindling-wood before supper?\"\\n\\n\"No--no, not to-night. Go and dress, while I send Uncle Boaz for\\nthe wine.\"\\n\\nShe entered the house with a hurried step, and Christopher, after\\nan instant\\'s hesitation, passed to the back, and, taking off his\\nclumsy boots, crept softly up the creaking staircase to his\\nlittle garret room in the loft.\\n\\nTen minutes later he came down again, wearing a decent suit of\\ncountry-made clothes, with the dust washed from his face, and his\\nhair smoothly brushed across his forehead. In the front hall he\\ntook a white rosebud from a little vase of Bohemian glass and\\npinned it carefully in the lapel of his coat. Then, before\\nentering, he stood for a moment silent upon the threshold of the\\nlamplighted room.\\n\\nIn a massive Elizabethan chair of blackened oak a stately old\\nlady was sitting straight and stiff, with her useless legs\\nstretched out upon an elaborately embroidered ottoman. She wore a\\ndress of rich black brocade, made very full in the skirt, and\\nsleeves after an earlier fashion, and her beautiful snow-white\\nhair was piled over a high cushion and ornamented by a cap of\\nfine thread lace. In her face, which she turned at the first\\nfootstep with a pitiable, blind look, there were the faint traces\\nof a proud, though almost extinguished, beauty--traces which were\\nvisible in the impetuous flash of her sightless eyes, in the\\nnoble arch of her brows, and in the transparent quality of her\\nnow yellowed skin, which still kept the look of rare porcelain\\nheld against the sunlight. On a dainty, rose-decked tray beside\\nher chair there were the half of a broiled chicken, a thin glass\\nof port, and a plate of buttered waffles; and near her high\\nfootstool a big yellow cat was busily lapping a saucer of new\\nmilk.\\n\\nAs Christopher went up to her, she stretched out her hand and\\ntouched his face with her sensitive fingers. \"Oh, if I could only\\nsee you,\" she said, a little peevishly. \"It is twenty years since\\nI looked at you, and now you are taller than your father was, you\\nsay. I can feel that your hair is light, like his and like\\nLila\\'s, too, since you are twins.\"\\n\\nA pretty, fragile woman, who was wrapping a shawl about the old\\nlady\\'s feet, rose to her full height and passed behind the\\nElizabethan chair.\" Just a shade lighter than mine, mother,\" she\\nresponded; \"the sun makes a difference, you know; he is in the\\nsun so much without a hat.\" As she stood with her delicate hands\\nclasped above the fancifully carved grotesques upon the\\nchair-back, her beauty shone like a lamp against the\\nsmoke-stained walls.\\n\\n\"Ah, if you could but have seen his father when he was young,\\nLila,\" sighed her mother, falling into one of the easy reveries\\nof old age. \"I met him at a fancy ball, you know, where he went\\nas Achilles in full Grecian dress. Oh! the sight he was, my dear,\\none of the few fair men among us, and taller even than old\\nColonel Fitzhugh, who was considered one of the finest figures of\\nhis time. That was a wild night for me, Christopher, as I\\'ve told\\nyou often before--it was love at first sight on both sides, and\\nso marked were your father\\'s attentions that they were the talk\\nof the ball. Edward Morris--the greatest wit of his day, you\\nknow--remarked at supper that the weak point of Achilles was\\nproved at last to be not his heel, but his heart.\"\\n\\nShe laughed with pleasure at the memory, and returned in a\\nhalf-hearted fashion to her plate of buttered waffles. \"Have you\\nbeen riding again, Christopher?\" she asked after a moment, as if\\nremembering a grievance. \"I haven\\'t had so much as a word from\\nyou to-day, but when one is chained to a chair like this it is\\nuseless to ask even to be thought of amid your pleasures.\"\\n\\n\"I always think of you, mother.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad to hear it, my dear, though I\\'m sure I should\\nnever imagine that you do. Have you heard, by the way, that Boaz\\nlost the key of the winecellar, and that I had to go two whole\\ndays without my port? I declare, he is getting so careless that\\nI\\'m afraid we\\'ll have to put another butler over him.\"\\n\\n\"Lawd, ole miss, you ain\\' gwine do dat, is you?\" anxiously\\nquestioned Uncle Boaz as he filled her glass.\\n\\nShe lifted the wine to her lips, her stern face softening. Like\\nmany a high-spirited woman doomed to perpetual inaction, her\\ndominion over her servants had grown to represent the larger\\nshare of life.\\n\\n\"Then be more careful in future, Boaz,\" she cautioned. \"Tell me,\\nLila, what has become of Nathan, the son of Phyllis? He used to\\nbe a very bright little darkey twenty years ago, and I always\\nintended putting him in the dining-room, but things escape me so.\\nHis mother, Phyllis, I remember, got some ridiculous idea about\\nfreedom in her head, and ran away with the Yankee soldiers before\\nwe whipped them.\"\\n\\nLila\\'s face flushed, for since the war Nathan had grown into one\\nof the most respectable of freedmen, but Uncle Boaz, with a glib\\ntongue, started valiantly to her support.\\n\\n\"Go \\'way, ole miss; dat ar Natan is de mos\\' ornery un er de hull\\nbunch,\" he declared. \"Wen he comes inter my dinin\\'-\\'oom, out I\\'se\\ngwine, an\\' days sho.\"\\n\\nThe old lady passed a hand slowly across her brow. \"I can\\'t\\nremember--I can\\'t remember,\" she murmured; \"but I dare say you\\'re\\nright, Boaz--and that reminds me that this bottle of port is not\\nso good as the last. Have you tried it, Christopher?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet, mother. Where did you find it, Uncle Boaz?\"\\n\\n\"Hit\\'s des de same, suh,\" protested Uncle Boaz. \"Dey wuz bofe un\\num layin\\' right side by side, des like dey \\'uz bo\\'n blood kin, en\\nI done dus\\' de cobwebs off\\'n um wid de same duster, dat I is.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well, that will do. Now go in to supper, children, and\\nsend Docia to take my tray. Dear me, I do wish that Tucker could\\nbe persuaded to give up that vulgar bacon. I\\'m not so\\nunreasonable, I hope, as to expect a man to make any sacrifices\\nin this world--that\\'s the woman\\'s part, and I\\'ve tried to take my\\nshare of it--but to conceive of a passion for a thing like\\nbacon--I declare is quite beyond me.\"\\n\\n\"Come, now, Lucy, don\\'t begin to meddle with my whims,\" protested\\nthe cheerful tones of Tucker, as he entered on his crutches, one\\nof which was strapped to the stump of his right arm. \"Allow me my\\ndissipations, my dear, and I\\'ll not interfere with yours.\"\\n\\n\"Dissipations!\" promptly took up the old lady, from the hearth.\\n\"Why, if it were such a gentlemanly thing as a dissipation,\\nTucker, I shouldn\\'t say a word--not a single word. A taste for\\nwine is entirely proper, I\\'m sure, and even a little intoxication\\nis permissible on occasions--such as christenings, weddings, and\\nChristmas Eve gatherings. Your father used to say, Christopher,\\nthat the proof of a gentleman was in the way he held his wine.\\nBut to fall a deliberate victim to so low-born a vice as a love\\nof bacon is something that no member of our family has ever done\\nbefore.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, Lucy,\" pleasantly assented Tucker; \"but then, you\\nsee, no member of our family had ever fought three years for his\\nState--to say nothing of losing a leg and an arm in her service.\"\\n\\nHis fine face was ploughed with the marks of suffering, but the\\nheartiness had not left his voice, and his smile still shone\\nbright and strong. From a proud position as the straightest shot\\nand the gayest liver of his day, he had been reduced at a single\\nblow to the couch of a hopeless cripple. Poverty had come a\\nlittle later, but the second shock had only served to steady his\\nnerves from the vibration of the first, and the courage which had\\ndrooped within him for a time was revived in the form of a rare\\nand gentle humour. Nothing was so terrible but Tucker could get a\\nlaugh out of it, people said--not knowing that since he had\\nlearned to smile at his own ghastly failure it was an easy matter\\nto turn the jest on universal joy or woe.\\n\\nThe old lady\\'s humour melted at his words, and she hastened to\\noffer proof of her contrition. \"You\\'re perfectly right, brother,\"\\nshe said; \"and I know I\\'m an ungrateful creature, so you needn\\'t\\ntake the trouble to tell me. As long as you do me the honour to\\nlive beneath my roof, you shall eat the whole hog or none to your\\nheart\\'s content.\"\\n\\nThen, as Docia, a large black woman, with brass hoops in her\\nears, appeared to bear away the supper tray, Mrs. Blake folded\\nher hands and settled herself for a nap upon her cushions, while\\nthe yellow cat purred blissfully on her knees.\\n\\nBeyond the adjoining bedroom, through which Christopher passed, a\\nrude plank platform led to a long, unceiled room which served as\\nkitchen and dining-room in one. Here a cheerful blaze made merry\\nabout an ancient crane, on which a coffeeboiler swung slowly back\\nand forth with a bubbling noise. In the red firelight a plain\\npine table was spread with a scant supper of cornbread and bacon\\nand a cracked Wedgewood pitcher filled with buttermilk. There was\\nno silver; the china consisted of some odd, broken pieces of old\\nwillow-ware; and beyond a bunch of damask roses stuck in a quaint\\nglass vase, there was no visible attempt to lighten the effect of\\nextreme poverty. An aged Negress, in a dress of linsey-woolsey\\nwhich resembled a patchwork quilt, was pouring hot, thin coffee\\ninto a row of cups with chipped or missing saucers.\\n\\nCynthia was already at the table, and when Christopher came in\\nshe served him with an anxious haste like that of a stricken\\nmother. To Tucker and herself the coarse fare was unbearable even\\nafter the custom of fifteen years, and time had not lessened the\\nsurprise with which they watched the young man\\'s healthful\\nenjoyment of his food. Even Lila, whose glowing face in its\\nnimbus of curls lent an almost festive air to her end of the\\nwhite pine board, ate with a heartiness which Cynthia, with her\\noutgrown standard for her sex, could not but find a trifle\\nvulgar. The elder sister had been born to a different heritage\\n--to one of restricted views and mincing manners for a\\nwoman--and, despite herself, she could but drift aimlessly on the\\nwidening current of the times.\\n\\n\"Christopher, will you have some coffee--it is stronger now?\" she\\nasked presently, reaching for his emptied cup.\\n\\n\"Dis yer stuff ain\\' no cawfy,\" grumbled Aunt Pony, taking the\\nboiler from the crane; \"hit ain\\' nuttin\\' but dishwater, I don\\'\\ncyar who done made hit.\" Then, as the door opened to admit Uncle\\nIsam with a bucket from the spring, she divided her scorn equally\\nbetween him and the coffee-pot.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t be a-castin\\' er you nets into dese yer pains,\" she\\nobserved cynically.\\n\\nUncle Isam, a dried old Negro of seventy years, shambled in\\npatiently and placed the bucket carefully upon the stones, to be\\nshrilly scolded by Aunt Polly for spilling a few drops on the\\nfloor. \"I reckon you is steddyin\\' ter outdo Marse Noah,\" she\\nremarked with scorn.\\n\\n\"Howdy, Marse Christopher? Howdy, Marse Tuck?\" Uncle Isam\\ninquired politely, as he seated himself in a low chair on the\\nhearth and dropped his clasped hands between his open knees.\\n\\nChristopher nodded carelessly. \"Glad to see you, Isam,\" Tucker\\ncordially responded. \"Times have changed since you used to live\\nover here.\"\\n\\n\"Days so, suh, dot\\'s so. Times dey\\'s done change, but I\\nain\\'t--I\\'se des de same. Dat\\'s de tribble wid dis yer worl\\'; w\\'en\\nhit change yo\\' fortune hit don\\' look ter changin\\' yo\\' skin es\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s true; but you\\'re doing all right, I hope?\"\\n\\n\"I dunno, Marse Tuck,\" replied Uncle Isam, coughing as a sudden\\nspurt of smoke issued from the old stone chimney. \"I dunno \\'bout\\ndat. Times dey\\'s right peart, but I ain\\'t. De vittles dey\\'s ready\\nter do dar tu\\'n, but de belly, hit ain\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"What--are you sick?\" asked Cynthia, with interest, rising from\\nthe table.\\n\\nUncle Isam sighed. \"I\\'se got a tur\\'able peskey feelin\\', Miss\\nCynthy, days de gospel trufe,\" he returned. \"I dunno whur hit\\'s\\nde lungs er de liver, but one un um done got moughty sassy ter de\\nyuther \\'en he done flung de reins right loose. Hit looks pow\\'ful\\nlike dey wuz gwine ter run twel dey bofe drap down daid, so I\\ndone come all dis way atter a dose er dem bitters ole miss use\\nter gin us befo\\' de wah.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never!\" said Cynthia, laughing. \"I believe he means the\\nbrown bitters mother used to make for chills and fever. I\\'m very\\nsorry, Uncle Isam, but we haven\\'t any. We don\\'t keep it any\\nlonger.\"\\n\\nLeaning over his gnarled palms, the old man shook his head in\\nsober reverie.\\n\\n\"Dar ain\\' nuttin\\' like dem bitters in dese yer days,\" he\\nreflected sadly, \"\\'caze de smell er dem use ter mos\\' knock you\\nflat \\'fo\\' you done taste \\'em, en all de way ter de belly dey use\\nter keep a-wukin\\' fur dey livin\\'. Lawd! Lawd!

Dar\\nain\\' no Eve. She\\'s done gone.\"\\n\\n\"Gone! Is she dead?\"\\n\\n\"Naw\\'m, she aint daid dat I knows--she\\'s des gone.\\n\\nHit all come along er dem highfalutin\\' notions days struttin\\'\\nroun\\' dese days \\'bout prancin\\' up de chu\\'ch aisle en bein\\' mah\\'ed\\nby de preacher, stedder des totin\\' all yo\\' belongin\\'s f\\'om one\\ncabin ter anurr, en roas\\'in\\' yo\\' ash-cake in de same pile er\\nashes.

Here, draw\\nup to the table and eat your supper, while I get down the\\nage-book and find your birth.\"\\n\\nShe reached for a dusty account book on one of the kitchen\\nshelves, and, bringing it to the table, began slowly turning the\\nyellowed leaves. For more than two hundred years the births of\\nall the Blake slaves had been entered in the big volume.\\n\\n\"You des wait, Miss Cynthy, you des wait twel I git dar,\"\\nremonstrated Uncle Isam, as he stirred his coffee. \"I ain\\' got no\\nuse fur dese yer newfangle fashions, dot\\'s wat I tell de chillun\\nw\\'en dey begin a-pesterin\\' me ter mah\\'y Eve--I ain\\' got no use\\nfur dem no way hit\\'s put--I ain\\' got no use fur dis yer struttin\\'\\nup de aisle bus\\'ness, ner fur dis yer w\\'arin\\' er sto\\'-made shoes,\\nner fur dis yer leavin\\' er de hyar unwropped, needer.

Carraway Plays Courtier\\n\\nAt twelve o\\'clock the next day, Carraway, walking in the June\\nbrightness along the road to the Blake cottage, came suddenly, at\\nthe bend of the old icepond, upon Maria Fletcher returning from a\\nmorning ride. The glow of summer was in her eyes, and though her\\nface was still pale, she seemed to him a different creature from\\nthe grave, repressed girl of the night before. He noticed at once\\nthat she sat her horse superbly, and in her long black habit all\\nthe sinuous lines of her figure moved in rhythm with the rapid\\npace.\\n\\nAs she neared him, and apparently before she had noticed his\\napproach, he saw her draw rein quickly, and, screened by the\\noverhanging boughs of a blossoming chestnut, send her glance like\\na hooded falcon across the neighbouring field. Following the aim\\nof her look, he saw Christopher Blake walking idly among the\\nheavy furrows, watching, with the interest of a born\\nagriculturist, the busy transplanting of Fletcher\\'s crop. He\\nstill wore his jean clothes, which, hanging loosely upon his\\nimpressive figure, blended harmoniously with the dull-purple\\ntones of the upturned soil. Beyond him there was a background of\\ndistant wood, still young in leaf, and his bared head, with the\\nstrong, sunburned line of his profile, stood out as distinctly as\\na portrait done in early Roman gold.\\n\\nThat Maria had seen in him some higher possibility than that of a\\nfield labourer was soon evident to Carraway, for her horse was\\nstill standing on the slight incline, and as he reached her side\\nshe turned with a frank question on her lips.\\n\\n\"Is that one of the labourers--the young giant by the fence?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I dare say he labours, if that\\'s what you mean. He\\'s young\\nBlake, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Young Blake?\" She bent her brows, and it was clear that the name\\nsuggested only a trivial recollection to her mind. \"There used to\\nbe some Blake children in the old overseer\\'s house--is this one\\nof them.\"\\n\\n\"Possibly; they live in the overseer\\'s house.\"\\n\\nShe leaned over, fastening her heavy gauntlet. \"They wouldn\\'t\\nplay with me, I remember; I couldn\\'t understand why. Once I\\ncarried my dolls over to their yard, and the boy set a pack of\\nhounds on me. I screamed so that an old Negro ran out and drove\\nthem off, and all the time the boy stood by, laughing and calling\\nme names. Is that he, do you think?\"\\n\\n\"I dare say. It sounds like him.\"\\n\\n\"Is he so cruel?\" she asked a little wistfully.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know about that--but he doesn\\'t like your people. Your\\ngrandfather had some trouble with him a long time ago.\"\\n\\n\"And he wanted to punish me?--how cowardly.\"\\n\\n\"It does sound rather savage, but it isn\\'t an ordinary case, you\\nknow. He\\'s the kind of person to curse \\'root and branch,\\' from\\nall I hear, in the good old Biblical fashion.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, he\\'s certainly very large, isn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s superb,\" said Carraway, with conviction.\\n\\n\"At a distance--so is that great pine over there,\" she lifted her\\nwhip and pointed across the field; then as Carraway made no\\nanswer, she smiled slightly and rode rapidly toward the Hall.\\n\\nFor a few minutes the lawyer stood where she had left him,\\nwatching in puzzled thought her swaying figure on the handsome\\nhorse. The girl fretted him, and yet he felt that he liked her\\nalmost in spite of himself--liked something fine and fearless he\\nfound in her dark eyes; liked, too, even while he sneered, her\\npeculiar grace of manner. There was the making of a woman in her\\nafter all, he told himself, as he turned into the sunken road,\\nwhere he saw Christopher already moving homeward. He had meant to\\ncatch up with him and join company on the way, but the young man\\ncovered ground so quickly with his great strides that at last\\nCarraway, losing sight of him entirely, resigned himself to going\\nleisurely about his errand.\\n\\nWhen, a little later, he opened the unhinged whitewashed gate\\nbefore the cottage, the place, as he found it, seemed to be\\ntenanted solely by a family of young turkeys scratching beneath\\nthe damask rose-bushes in the yard. From a rear chimney a dark\\nstreak of smoke was rising, but the front of the house gave no\\noutward sign of life, and as there came no answer to his\\ninsistent knocks he at last ventured to open the door and pass\\ninto the narrow hall. From the first room on the right a voice\\nspoke at his entrance, and following the sound he found himself\\nface to face with Mrs. Blake in her massive Elizabethan chair.\\n\\n\"There is a stranger in the room,\" she said rigidly, turning her\\nsightless eyes; \"speak at once.\"\\n\\n\"I beg pardon most humbly for my intrusion,\" replied Carraway,\\nconscious of stammering like an offending schoolboy, \"but as no\\none answered my knock, I committed the indiscretion of opening a\\nclosed door.\"\\n\\nAwed as much by the stricken pallor of her appearance as by the\\ninappropriate grandeur of her black brocade and her thread lace\\ncap, he advanced slowly and stood awaiting his dismissal.\\n\\n\"What door?\" she demanded sharply, much to his surprise.\\n\\n\"Yours, madam.\"\\n\\n\"Not answer your knock?\" she pursued, with indignation. \"So that\\nwas the noise I heard, and no wonder that you entered. Why, what\\nis the matter with the place? Where are the servants?\"\\n\\nHe humbly replied that he had seen none, to be taken up with her\\naccustomed quickness of touch.\\n\\n\"Seen none! Why, there are three hundred of them, sir. Well,\\nwell, this is really too much. I shall put a butler over Boaz\\nthis very day.\"\\n\\nFor an instant Carraway felt strangely tempted to turn and run as\\nfast as he could along the sunken road--remembering, as he\\nstruggled with the impulse, that he had once been caught at the\\nage of ten and whipped for stealing apples. Recovering with an\\neffort his sense of dignity, he offered the suggestion that Boaz,\\ninstead of being seriously in fault, might merely have been\\nengaged in useful occupations \"somewhere at the back.\"\\n\\n\"What on earth can he have to do at the back, sir?\" inquired the\\nirrepressible old lady; \"but since you were so kind as to\\noverlook our inhospitable reception, will you not be equally good\\nand tell me your name?\"\\n\\n\"I fear it won\\'t enlighten you much,\" replied the lawyer\\nmodestly, \"but my name happens to be Guy Carraway.\"\\n\\n\"Guy--Guy Carraway,\" repeated Mrs. Blake, as if weighing each\\nseparate letter in some remote social scales. \" I\\'ve known many a\\nGuy in my day--and that part, at least, of your name is quite\\nfamiliar. There was Guy Nelson, and Guy Blair, and Guy Marshall,\\nthe greatest beau of his time--but I don\\'t think I ever had the\\npleasure of meeting a Carraway before.\"\\n\\n\"That is more than probable, ma\\'am, but I have the advantage of\\nyou, since, as a child, I was once taken out upon the street\\ncorner merely to see you go by on your way to a fancy ball, where\\nyou appeared as Diana.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blake yielded gracefully to the skilful thrust.\\n\\n\"Ah, I was Lucy Corbin then,\" she sighed. \"You find few traces of\\nher in me now, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, your mirror cannot speak for me.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a flatterer--a sad flatterer, I see,\" she returned, a\\nlittle wistfully; \"but it does no harm, as I tell my son, to\\nflatter the old. It is well to strew the passage to the grave\\nwith flowers.\"\\n\\n\"How well I remember that day, \" said Carraway, speaking softly.\\n\"There was a crowd about the door, waiting to see you come out,\\nand a carpenter lifted me upon his shoulder. Your hair was as\\nblack as night, and there was a circle round your head.\"\\n\\n\"A silver fillet,\" she corrected, with a smile in which there was\\na gentle archness.\\n\\n\"A fillet, yes; and you carried a bow and a quiver full of\\narrows. I declare, it seems but yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"It was more than fifty years ago,\" murmured the old lady. Well,\\nwell, I\\'ve had my day, sir, and it was a merry one. I am almost\\nseventy years old, I\\'m half dead, and stone blind into the\\nbargain, but I can say to you that this is a cheerful world in\\nspite of the darkness in which I linger on. I\\'d take it over\\nagain and gladly any day--the pleasure and the pain, the light\\nand the darkness. Why, I sometimes think that my present\\nblindness was given me in order that I might view the past more\\nclearly. There\\'s not a ball of my youth, nor a face I knew, nor\\neven a dress I wore, that I don\\'t see more distinctly every day.\\nThe present is a very little part of life, sir; it\\'s the past in\\nwhich we store our treasures.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right, you\\'re right,\" replied Carraway, drawing his chair\\nnearer the embroidered ottoman and leaning over to stroke the\\nyellow cat; \"and I\\'m glad to hear so cheerful a philosophy from\\nyour lips.\"\\n\\n\"It is based on a cheerful experience--I\\'ve been as you see me\\nnow only twenty years.\"\\n\\nOnly twenty years! He looked mutely round the soiled whitewashed\\nwalls, where hung a noble gathering of Blake portraits in massive\\nold gilt frames. Among them he saw the remembered face of Lucy\\nCorbin herself, painted under a rose-garland held by smiling\\nLoves.\\n\\n\"Life has its trials, of course, \" pursued Mrs. Blake, as if\\nspeaking to herself. \"I can\\'t look out upon the June flowers, you\\nknow, and though the pink crape-myrtle at my window is in full\\nbloom I cannot see it.\"\\n\\nFollowing her gesture, Carraway glanced out into the little yard;\\nno myrtle was there, but he remembered vaguely that he had seen\\none in blossom at the Hall.\\n\\n\"You keep flowers about you, though,\" he said, alluding to the\\nscattered vases of June roses.\\n\\n\"Not my crape-myrtle. I planted it myself when I first came home\\nwith Mr. Blake, and I have never allowed so much as a spray of it\\nto be plucked.\"\\n\\nForgetting his presence, she lapsed for a time into one of the\\npathetic day-dreams of old age. Then recalling herself suddenly,\\nher tone took on a sprightliness like that of youth.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not often that we have the pleasure of entertaining a\\nstranger in our out-of-the-way house, sir so may I ask where you\\nare staying--or perhaps you will do us the honour to sleep\\nbeneath our roof. It has had the privilege of sheltering General\\nWashington.\"\\n\\n\"You are very kind,\" replied Carraway, with a gratitude that was\\nfrom his heart, \"but to tell the truth, I feel that I am sailing\\nunder false colours. The real object of my visit is to ask a\\nbusiness interview with your son. I bring what seems to me a very\\nfair offer for the place.\"\\n\\nGrasping the carved arms of her chair, Mrs. Blake turned the\\nwonder in her blind eyes upon him.\\n\\n\"An offer for the place! Why, you must be dreaming, sir! A Blake\\nowned it more than a hundred years before the Revolution.\"\\n\\nAt the instant, understanding broke upon Carraway like a\\nthundercloud, and as he rose from his seat it seemed to him that\\nhe had missed by a single step the yawning gulf before him. Blind\\nterror gripped him for the moment, and when his brain steadied he\\nlooked up to meet, from the threshold of the adjoining room, the\\nenraged flash of Christopher\\'s eyes. So tempestuous was the\\nglance that Carraway, impulsively falling back, squared himself\\nto receive a physical blow; but the young man, without so much as\\nthe expected oath, came in quietly and took his stand behind the\\nElizabethan chair.\\n\\n\"Why, what a joke, mother,\" he said, laughing; \"he means the old\\nWeatherby farm, of course. The one I wanted to sell last year,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d sold it to the Weatherbys, Christopher.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit of it--they backed out at the last; but don\\'t begin to\\nbother your head about such things; they aren\\'t worth it. And\\nnow, sir,\" he turned upon Carraway, \"since your business is with\\nme, perhaps you will have the goodness to step outside.\"\\n\\nWith the feeling that he was asked out for a beating, Carraway\\nturned for a farewell with Mrs. Blake, but the imperious old lady\\nwas not to be so lightly defrauded of a listener.\\n\\n\"Business may come later, my son,\" she said, detaining them by a\\ngesture of her heavily ringed hand. \"After dinner you may take\\nMr. Carraway with you into the library and discuss your affairs\\nover a bottle of burgundy, as was your grandfather\\'s custom\\nbefore you; meanwhile, he and I will resume our very pleasant\\ntalk which you interrupted. He remembers seeing me in the old\\ndays when we were all in the United States, my dear.\"\\n\\nChristopher\\'s brow grew black, and he threw a sharp and malignant\\nglance of sullen suspicion at Carraway, who summoned to meet it\\nhis most frank and open look.\\n\\n\"I saw your mother in the height of her fame,\" he said, smiling,\\n\"so I may count myself one of her oldest admirers, I believe. You\\nmay assure yourself,\" he added softly, \"that I have her welfare\\nvery decidedly at heart.\"\\n\\nAt this Christopher smiled back at him, and there was something\\nof the June brightness in his look.\\n\\n\"Well, take care, sir,\" he answered, and went out, closing the\\ndoor carefully behind him, while Carraway applied himself to a\\ndetermined entertaining of Mrs. Blake.\\n\\nTo accomplish this he found that he had only to leave her free,\\nguiding her thoughts with his lightest touch into newer channels.\\nThe talk had grown merrier now, and he soon discovered that she\\npossessed a sharpened wit as well as a ready tongue. From subject\\nto subject she passed with amazing swiftness, bearing down upon\\nher favourite themes with the delightful audacity of the talker\\nwho is born, not made. She spoke of her own youth, of historic\\nflirtations in the early twenties, of great beaux she had known,\\nand of famous recipes that had been handed down for generations.\\nEverywhere he felt her wonderful keenness of perception, that\\nintuitive understanding of men and manners which had kept her for\\nso long the reigning belle among her younger rivals.\\n\\nAs she went on he found that her world was as different from his\\nown as if she dwelt upon some undiscovered planet--a world\\npeopled with shades and governed by an ideal group of abstract\\nlaws. She lived upon lies, he saw, and thrived upon the sweetness\\nshe extracted from them. For her the Confederacy had never\\nfallen, the quiet of her dreamland had been disturbed by no\\ninvading army, and the three hundred slaves, who had in reality\\nscattered like chaff before the wind, she still saw in her\\ncheerful visions tilling her familiar fields. It was as if she\\nhad fallen asleep with the great blow that bad wrecked her body,\\nand had dreamed on steadily throughout the years. Of real changes\\nshe was as ignorant as a new-born child. Events had shaken the\\nworld to its centre, and she, by her obscure hearth, had not felt\\nso much as a sympathetic tremor. In her memory there was no\\nAppomattox, news of the death of Lincoln had never reached her\\nears, and president had peacefully succeeded president in the\\nsecure Confederacy in which she lived. Wonderful as it all was,\\nto Carraway the most wonderful thing was the intricate tissue of\\nlies woven around her chair. Lies--lies--there had been nothing\\nbut lies spoken within her hearing for twenty years.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. In Which a Stand is Made\\n\\nDim wonder was still upon him when Docia appeared bearing her\\nmistress\\'s dinner-tray, and a moment later Cynthia came in and\\npaused uncertainly near the threshold.\\n\\n\"Do you wish anything, mother?\"\\n\\n\"Only to present Mr. Carraway, my child. He will be with us at\\ndinner.\"\\n\\nCynthia came forward smiling and held out her hand with the\\ncordial hospitality which she had inherited with the family\\nportraits and the good old name. She wore this morning a dress of\\ncheap black calico, shrunken from many washings, and beneath the\\nscant sleeves Carraway saw her thin red wrists, which looked as\\nif they had been soaking in harsh soapsuds. Except for a certain\\nease of manner which she had not lost in the drudgery of her\\nlife, she might have been sister to the toilworn slattern he had\\nnoticed in one of the hovels across the country.\\n\\n\"We shall be very glad to have you,\" she said, with quiet\\ndignity.\\n\\n\"It is ready now, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Be sure to make him try the port, Cynthia,\" called Mrs. Blake,\\nas Carraway followed the daughter across the threshold.\\n\\nIn the kitchen they found Tucker and Lila and a strange young man\\nin overalls, who was introduced as \"one of the Weatherbys who\\nlive just up the road.\" He was evidently one of their plainer\\nneighbours for Carraway detected a constraint in Cynthia\\'s manner\\nwhich Lila did not appear to share. The girl, dressed daintily in\\na faded muslin, with an organdy kerchief crossed over her\\nswelling bosom, flashed upon Carraway\\'s delighted vision like one\\nof the maidens hanging, gilt-framed, in the old lady\\'s parlour.\\nThat she was the particular pride of the family--the one luxury\\nthey allowed themselves besides their costly mother--the lawyer\\nrealised upon the instant. Her small white hands were unsoiled by\\nany work, and her beautiful, kindly face had none of the nervous\\ndread which seemed always lying behind Cynthia\\'s tired eyes. With\\nthe high devotion of a martyr, the elder sister must have offered\\nherself a willing sacrifice, winning for the younger an existence\\nwhich, despite its gray monotony, showed fairly rose-coloured in\\ncomparison with her own. She herself had sunk to the level of a\\nservant, but through it all Lila had remained \"the lady,\"\\npreserving an equable loveliness to which Jim Weatherby hardly\\ndared lift his wistful gaze.\\n\\nAs for the young man himself, he had a blithe, open look which\\nCarraway found singularly attractive, the kind of look it warms\\none\\'s heart to meet in the long road on a winter\\'s day. Leaning\\nidly against the lintel of the door, and fingering a bright axe\\nwhich he was apparently anxious that they should retain, he\\npresented a pleasant enough picture to the attentive eyes within\\nthe kitchen.\\n\\n\"You\\'d as well keep this axe as long as you want it,\" he\\nprotested earnestly. \" It\\'s an old one, anyway, that I sharpened\\nwhen you asked for it, and we\\'ve another at home; that\\'s all we\\nneed.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very kind of you, Jim, but ours is mended now,\" replied\\nCynthia, a trifle stiffly.\\n\\n\"If we need one again, we\\'ll certainly borrow yours, \"added Lila,\\nsmiling as she looked up from the glasses she was filling with\\nfresh buttermilk.\\n\\n\"Sit down, Jim, and have dinner with us; there\\'s no hurry,\" urged\\nTucker hospitably, with a genial wave toward the meagerly spread\\ntable. \"Jim\\'s a great fellow, Mr. Carraway; you ought to know\\nhim. He can manage anything from a Sunday-school to the digging\\nof a well. I\\'ve always said that if he\\'d had charge of the\\nchildren of Israel\\'s journey to the promised land he\\'d have had\\nthem there, flesh-pots and all, before the week was up.\"\\n\\n\"I can see he is a useful neighbour,\" observed Carraway, glancing\\nat the axe.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad I come handy, \" replied Jim in his hearty way;\\n\"and are you sure you don\\'t want me to split up that big oak log\\nat the woodpile? I can do it in a twinkling.\"\\n\\nCynthia declined his knightly offer, to be overruled again by\\nLila\\'s smiling lips.\\n\\n\"Christopher will have to do it when he comes in, \" she said;\\n\"poor Christopher, he never has a single moment of his own.\"\\n\\nJim Weatherby looked at her eagerly, his blue eyes full of\\nsparkle. \"Why, I can do it in no time,\" he declared, shouldering\\nhis axe, and a moment afterward they heard his merry strokes from\\nthe woodpile.\\n\\n\"Are you interested in tobacco, Mr. Carraway?\" inquired Tucker,\\nas they seated themselves at the pine table without so much as an\\napology for the coarseness of the fare or an allusion to their\\nfallen fortunes. \"If so, you\\'ve struck us at the time when every\\nman about here is setting out his next winter\\'s chew. Sol\\nPeterkin, by the way, has planted every square inch of his land\\nin tobacco, and when I asked him what market he expected to send\\nit to he answered that he only raised a little for his own use.\"\\n\\n\"Is that the Peterkin who has the pretty daughter?\" asked\\nCynthia, slicing a piece of bacon. \"May I help you to turnip\\nsalad, Mr. Carraway?\" Uncle Boaz, hobbling with rheumatism, held\\nout a quaint old tray of inlaid woods; and the lawyer, as he\\nplaced his plate upon it, heaved a sigh of gratitude for the\\nutter absence of vulgarity. He could fancy dear old Miss Saidie\\npuffing apologies over the fat bacon, and Fletcher profanely\\ndeploring the sloppy coffee.\\n\\n\"The half-grown girl with the bunch of flaxen curls tied with a\\nblue ribbon?\" returned Tucker, while Lila cut up his food as if\\nhe were a child. \"Yes, that\\'s Molly Peterkin, though it\\'s hard to\\nbelieve she\\'s any kin to Sol. I shouldn\\'t wonder if she turned\\ninto a bouncing beauty a few years further on.\"\\n\\n\"It was her father, then, that I walked over with from the\\ncross-roads,\" said Carraway. \"He struck me as a shrewd man of his\\nsort.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s shrewd enough,\" rejoined Tucker, \"and the proof of it\\nis that he\\'s outlived three wives and is likely to outlive a\\nfourth. I met him in the road yesterday, and he told me that he\\nhad just been off again to get married. \\'Good luck to you this\\ntime, Sol\\', said I. \\'Wal, it ought to be, sir,\\' said he, \\'seeing\\nas marrying has got to be so costly in these days. Why, my first\\nwife didn\\'t come to more than ten dollars, counting the stovepipe\\nhat and all, and this last one\\'s mounted up to \\'most a hundred.\\'\\n\\'Try and take good care of her, then,\\' I cautioned; \"they come\\ntoo high to throw away.\" \"That\\'s true, sir,\" he answered, with a\\nsorrowful shake of his head. \"But the trouble is that as the\\nprice goes up the quality gets poorer. My first one lasted near\\non to thirty years, and did all the chores about the house, to\\nsay nothing of the hog-pen; and if you\\'ll believe me, sir, the\\none before this stuck at the hog-feeding on her wedding day, and\\nthen wore out before twelve months were up.\\'\"\\n\\nHe finished with his humorous chuckle and lifted his fork\\nskilfully in his left hand.\\n\\n\"I dare say he overvalues himself as a husband,\" remarked\\nCarraway, joining in the laugh, \"but he has at least the merit of\\nbeing loyal to your family.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I believe he has; but then, he doesn\\'t like new folks or\\nnew things, I reckon. There\\'s a saying that his hatred of changes\\nkeeps him from ever changing his clothes.\"\\n\\nChristopher came in at the moment, and with a slight bow to\\nCarraway, slipped into his place.\\n\\n\"What\\'s Jim Weatherby chopping up that log for?\" he asked,\\nglancing in the direction of the ringing strokes.\\n\\nCynthia looked at him almost grimly, and there was a contraction\\nof the muscles about her determined mouth.\\n\\n\"Ask Lila,\" she responded quietly. As Christopher\\'s questioning\\ngaze turned to her, Lila flushed rose-pink and played nervously\\nwith the breadcrumbs on the table.\\n\\n\"He said he had nothing else to do,\" she answered, with an\\neffort, \"and he knew you were so busy--that was all.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s a first rate fellow,\" commented Christopher, as he\\nreached for the pitcher of buttermilk, \"but I don\\'t see what\\nmakes him so anxious to do my work.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s Jim\\'s way, you know,\" put in Tucker with his offhand\\nkindliness. \"He\\'s the sort of old maid who would undertake to\\nstraighten the wilderness if he could get the job. Why, I\\nactually found him once chopping off dead boughs in the woods,\\nand when I laughed he excused himself by saying that he couldn\\'t\\nbear to see trees look so scraggy.\"\\n\\nAs he talked, his pleasant pale blue eyes twinkled with humour,\\nand his full double chin shook over his shirt of common calico.\\nHe had grown very large from his long inaction, and it was with a\\nperceptible effort that he moved himself upon his slender\\ncrutches. Yet despite his maimed and suffering body he was\\ndressed with a scrupulous neatness which was almost like an air\\nof elegance. As he chatted on easily, Carraway forgot, in\\nlistening to him, the harrowing details in the midst of which he\\nsat--forgot the overheated, smoky kitchen, the common pine table\\nwith its broken china, and the sullen young savage whom he faced.\\n\\nFor Christopher was eating his dinner hurriedly, staring at his\\nplate in a moodiness which he did not take the trouble to\\nconceal. With all the youthful beauty of his face, there was a\\nboorishness in his ill-humour which in a less commanding figure\\nwould have been repellent--an evident pride in the sincerity of\\nthe scowl upon his brow. When his meal was over he rose with a\\nmuttered excuse and went out into the yard, where a few minutes\\nafterward Carraway was bold enough to follow him.\\n\\nThe afternoon was golden with sunshine, and every green leaf on\\nthe trees seemed to stand out clearly against the bright blue\\nsky. In the rear of the house there was a lack of the careful\\ncleanliness he had noticed at the front, and rotting chips from\\nthe woodpile strewed the short grass before the door, where a\\nclump of riotous ailanthus shoots was waging a desperate battle\\nfor existence. Beside the sunken wooden step a bare brown patch\\nshowed where the daily splashes of hot soapsuds had stripped the\\nground of even the modest covering that it wore. Within a stone\\'s\\nthrow of the threshold the half of a broken wheelbarrow, white\\nwith mould, was fast crumbling into earth, and a little farther\\noff stood a disorderly group of chicken coops before which lay a\\ncouple of dead nestlings. On the soaking plank ledge around the\\nwell-brink, where fresh water was slopping from the overturned\\nbucket, several bedraggled ducks were paddling with evident\\nenjoyment. The one pleasant sight about the place was the sturdy\\nfigure of Jim Weatherby, still at work upon the giant body of a\\ndead oak tree.\\n\\nWhen Carraway came out, Christopher was feeding a pack of hounds\\nfrom a tin pan of coarse corn bread, and to the lawyer\\'s surprise\\nhe was speaking to them in a tone that sounded almost jocular.\\nThough born of a cringing breed, the dogs looked contented and\\nwell fed, and among them Carraway recognised his friend Spy, who\\nhad followed at the heels of Uncle Boaz.\\n\\n\"Here, Miser, this is yours,\" the young man was saying. \"There,\\nyou needn\\'t turn up your nose; it\\'s as big as Blister\\'s. Down,\\nSpy, I tell you; you\\'ve had twice your share; you think because\\nyou\\'re the best looking you\\'re to be the best fed, too.\"\\n\\nAs Carraway left the steps the dogs made an angry rush at him, to\\nbe promptly checked by Christopher.\\n\\n\"Back, you fools; back, I say. You\\'d better be careful how you\\nwalk about here, sir,\" he added; \"they\\'d bite as soon as not--all\\nof them except Spy.\\n\\n\"Good fellow, Spy,\" returned Carraway, a little nervously, and\\nthe hound came fawning to his feet. \"I assure you I have no\\nintention of treading upon their preserves,\" he hastened to\\nexplain; \"but I should like a word with you, and this seems to be\\nthe only opportunity I\\'ll have, as I return to town to-morrow.\"\\n\\nChristopher threw the remaining pieces of corn bread into the\\nwriggling pack, set the pan in the doorway, and wiped his hands\\ncarelessly upon his overalls.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t see what you\\'ve got to say to me,\" he replied,\\nwalking rapidly in the direction of the well, where he waited for\\nthe other to join him.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about the place, of course,\" returned the lawyer, with an\\nattempt to shatter the awkward rustic reserve. \"I understand that\\nit has passed into your possession.\"\\n\\nThe young man nodded, and, drawing out his clasp-knife, fell to\\nwhittling a splinter which he had broken from the well-brink.\\n\\n\"In that case,\" pursued Carraway, feeling as if he were dashing\\nhis head against a wall, \"I shall address myself to you in the\\nbriefest terms. The place, I suppose, as it stands, is not worth\\nmuch to-day. Even good land is cheap, and this is poor.\"\\n\\nAgain Christopher nodded, intent upon his whittling. \"I reckon it\\nwouldn\\'t bring more than nine hundred,\" he responded coolly.\\n\\n\"Then my position is easy, for I am sure you will consider\\nfavourably the chance to sell at treble its actual value. I am\\nauthorised to offer you three thousand dollars for the farm.\"\\n\\nFor a moment Christopher stared at him in silence, then, \"What in\\nthe devil do you want with it?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\"I am not acting for myself in the matter,\" returned the lawyer,\\nafter a short hesitation. \"The offer is made through me by\\nanother. That it is to your advantage to accept it is my honest\\nconviction.\"\\n\\nChristopher tossed the bit of wood at a bedraggled drake that\\nwaddled off, quacking angrily.\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s Fletcher behind you,\" he said in the same cool tones.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that is neither here nor there. Naturally Mr.\\nFletcher is very anxious to secure the land. As it stands, it is\\na serious inconvenience to him, of course.\"\\n\\nLaughing, Christopher snapped the blade of his knife.\\n\\n\"Well, you may tell him from me,\" he retorted, \"that just as long\\nas it is \\'a serious inconvenience to him\\' it shall stand as it\\nis. Why, man, if Fletcher wanted that broken wheelbarrow enough\\nto offer me three thousand dollars for it, I wouldn\\'t let him\\nhave it. The only thing I\\'d leave him free to take, if I could\\nhelp it, is the straight road to damnation!\"\\n\\nHis voice, for all the laughter, sounded brutal, and Carraway,\\ngazing at him in wonder, saw his face grow suddenly lustful like\\nthat of an evil deity. The beauty was still there, blackened and\\ndistorted, a beauty that he felt to be more sinister than\\nugliness. The lawyer was in the presence of a great naked\\npassion, and involuntarily he lowered his eyes.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think he understands your attitude,\" he said quietly;\\n\"it seems to him--and to me also, I honestly affirm--that you\\nwould reap an advantage as decided as his own.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is to my advantage, I tell you, that isn\\'t harm to him.\\nHe knows it if he isn\\'t as big a fool as he is a rascal.\"\\n\\n\"Then I may presume that you are entirely convinced in your own\\nmind that you have a just cause for the stand you take?\"\\n\\n\"Cause!\" the word rapped out like an oath. \"He stole my home, I\\ntell you; he stole every inch of land I owned, and every penny.\\nWhere did he get the money to buy the place--he a slave-overseer?\\nWhere did he get it, I ask, unless he had been stealing for\\ntwenty years?\"\\n\\n\"It looks ugly, I confess,\" admitted Carraway; \"but were there no\\nbooks--no accounts kept?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he settled that, of course. When my father died, and we\\nasked for the books, where were they?\\n\\nBurned, he said--burned in the old office that the Yankees fired.\\nHe\\'s a scoundrel, I tell you, sir, and I know him to the core.\\nHe\\'s a rotten scoundrel!\"\\n\\nCarraway caught his breath quickly and drew back as if he had\\ntouched unwittingly a throbbing canker. To his oversensitive\\nnature these primal emotions had a crudeness that was vulgar in\\nits unrestraint. He beheld it all--the old wrong and the new\\nhatred--in a horrid glare of light, a disgraceful blaze of\\ntrumpets. Here there was no cultured evasion of the conspicuous\\nvice--none of the refinements even of the Christian ethics--it\\nwas all raw and palpitating humanity.\\n\\n\"Then my mission is quite useless,\" he confessed. \"I can only add\\nthat I am sorrier than I can say sorry for the whole thing, too.\\nIf my services could be of any use to you I should not hesitate\\nto offer them, but so far as I see there is absolutely nothing to\\nbe done. An old crime, as you know, very often conforms to an\\nappearance of virtue.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand, Christopher shook it, and then the lawyer\\nwent back into the house to bid good-by to Mrs. Blake. When he\\ncame out a few moments later, and passed through the whitewashed\\ngate into the sunken road, he saw that Christopher was still\\nstanding where he had left him, the golden afternoon around him,\\nand the bedraggled ducks paddling at his feet.\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII. Treats of a Passion that is Not Love\\n\\nOver a distant meadow fluted the silver whistle of a partridge,\\nand Christopher, lifting his head, noted involuntarily the\\ndirection of the sound. A covey was hatching down by the meadow\\nbrook, he knew--for not a summer mating nor a hidden nest had\\nescaped his eyes--and he wondered vaguely if the young birds were\\nroaming into Fletcher\\'s wheatfield. Then, with a single vigorous\\nmovement as if he were settling his thoughts upon him, he crossed\\nthe yard, leaped the fence by the barnyard, and started briskly\\nalong the edge of a little cattle pasture, where a strange bull\\nbellowed in the shadow of a walnut-tree. At the bottom of the\\npasture a crumbling rail fence divided his land from Fletcher\\'s,\\nand as he looked over the festoons of poisonous ivy he saw\\nFletcher himself overseeing the last planting of his tobacco. For\\na time Christopher watched them as through a mist--watched the\\nwhite and the black labourers, the brown furrows in which the\\nsmall holes were bored, the wilted plants thrown carelessly in\\nplace and planted with two quick pressures of a bare,\\nearth-begrimed foot. He smelled the keen odours released by the\\nsunshine from the broken soil; he saw the standing beads of sweat\\non the faces of the planters--Negroes with swollen lips and\\npleasant eyes like those of kindly animals--and he heard the\\ncoarse, hectoring voice of Fletcher, who stood midway of the\\nnaked ground. To regard the man as a mere usurper of his land had\\nbeen an article in the religious creed the child had learned, and\\nas he watched him now, bearded, noisy, assured of his\\npossessions, the sight lashed him like the strokes of a whip on\\nbleeding flesh. In the twenty-five years of his life he had grown\\nfairly gluttonous of hate--had tended it with a passion that was\\nlike that of love. Now he felt that he had never really had\\nenough of it--had never feasted on the fruit of it till he was\\nsatisfied--had never known the delight of wallowing in it until\\nto-day. Deep-rooted like an instinct as the feeling was, he knew\\nnow that there had been hours when, for very weakness of his\\nnature, he had almost forgotten that he meant to pay back\\nFletcher in the end, when it seemed, after all, easier merely to\\nendure and forget and have it done. Still keeping upon his own\\nland, he turned presently and followed a little brook that\\ncrossed a meadow where mixed wild flowers were strewn loosely in\\nthe grass. The bull still bellowed in the shadow of the\\nwalnut-tree, and he found himself listening with pure delight to\\nthe savage cries. Reaching at last a point where the brook turned\\nwestward at the foot of a low green hill, he threw himself over\\nthe dividing rail fence, and came, at the end of a minute\\'s\\nhurried walk, to the old Blake graveyard, midway of one of\\nFletcher\\'s fallow fields. The gate was bricked up, after the\\nsuperstitious custom of many country burial places, but he\\nclimbed the old moss-grown wall, where poisonous ivy grew rank\\nand venomous, and landing deep in the periwinkle that carpeted\\nthe ground, made his way rapidly to the flat oblong slab beneath\\nwhich his father lay. The marble was discoloured by long rains\\nand stained with bruised periwinkle, and the shallow lettering\\nwas hidden under a fall of dried needles from a little stunted\\nfir-tree; but, leaning over, he carefully swept the dust away and\\nloosened the imprisoned name which seemed to hover like a\\nspiritual presence upon the air.\\n\\n\"HERE LIES ALL THAT IS MORTAL OF CHRISTOPHER BLAKE, WHO DIED IN\\nTHE HOPE OF A JOYFUL RESURRECTION, APRIL 12, 1786, AGED 70 YEARS.\\nINTO THY HANDS, O LORD, I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.\"\\n\\nAround him there were other graves--graves of all dead Blakes for\\ntwo hundred years, and the flat tombstones were crowded so\\nthickly together that it seemed as if the dead must lie beneath\\nthem row on row. It was all in deep shadow, fallen slabs, rank\\nperiwinkle, dust and mould--no cheerful sunshine had ever\\npenetrated through the spreading cedars overhead. Life was here,\\nbut it was the shy life of wild creatures, approaching man only\\nwhen he had returned to earth. A mocking-bird purled a love note\\nin the twilight of a great black cedar, a lizard glided like a\\ngray shadow along one of the overturned slabs, and at his\\nentrance a rabbit had started from the ivy on his father\\'s grave.\\nTo climb the overgrown wall and lie upon the periwinkle was like\\nentering, for a time, the world of shades--a world far removed\\nfrom the sunny meadow and the low green hill.\\n\\nWith his head pillowed upon his father\\'s grave, Christopher\\nstretched himself at full length on the ground and stared\\nstraight upward at the darkbrowed cedars. It was such an hour as\\nhe allowed himself at long intervals when his inheritance was\\nheavy upon him and his disordered mind needed to retreat into a\\ncity of refuge. As a child he had often come to this same spot to\\ndream hopefully of the future, unboylike dreams in which the\\nspirit of revenge wore the face of happiness. Then, with the\\ninconsequence of childhood, he had pictured Fletcher gasping\\nbeneath his feet--trampled out like a worm, when he was big\\nenough to take his vengeance and come again into his own. Mere\\nphysical strength seemed to him at that age the sole thing\\nneeded--he wanted then only the brawny arm and the heart bound by\\ntriple brass.\\n\\nNow, as he stretched out his square, sunburned hand, with its\\nmisshapen nails, he laughed aloud at the absurdity of those\\nblunted hopes. To-day he stood six feet three inches from the\\nground, with muscles hard as steel and a chest that rang sound as\\na bell, yet how much nearer his purpose had he been as a little\\nchild! He remembered the day that he had hidden in the bushes\\nwith his squirrel gun and waited with fluttering breath for the\\nsound of Fletcher\\'s footsteps along the road. On that day it had\\nseemed to him that the hand of the Lord was in his own Godlike\\nvengeance nerving his little wrist. He had meant to shoot--for\\nthat he had saved every stray penny from his sales of hogs and\\ncider, of watermelons and chinkapins; for that he had bought the\\ngun and rammed the powder home. Even when the thud of footsteps\\nbeat down the sunny road strewn with brown honeyshucks, he had\\nfelt neither fear nor hesitation as he crouched amid the\\nunderbrush. Rather there was a rare exhilaration, warm blood in\\nhis brain and a sharp taste in his mouth like that of unripe\\nfruit--as if he had gorged himself upon the fallen honeyshucks.\\nIt was the happiest moment of his life, he knew, the one moment\\nwhen he seemed to measure himself inch by inch with fate; and\\nlike all such supreme instants, it fell suddenly flat among the\\npassing hours. For even as the gun was lifted, at the very second\\nthat Fletcher\\'s heavy body swung into view, he heard a crackling\\nin the dead bushes at his back, and Uncle Boaz struck up his arm\\nwith a palsied hand.\\n\\n\"Gawd alive, honey, you don\\' wanter be tucken out an\\' hunged?\"\\nthe old man cried in terror.\\n\\nThe boy rose in a passion and flung his useless gun aside. \"Oh,\\nyou\\'ve spoiled it! you\\'ve spoiled it!\" he sobbed, and shed bitter\\ntears upon the ground.\\n\\nTo this hour, lying on his father\\'s grave, he knew that he\\nregretted that wasted powder--that will to slay which had blazed\\nup and died down so soon. Strangely enough, it soothed him now to\\nremember how near to murder he had been, and as he drank the\\nsummer air in deep drafts he felt the old desire rekindle from\\nits embers. While he lived it was still possible--the one chance\\nthat awaits the ready hand, the final answer of a sympathetic\\nheaven that deals out justice. His god was a pagan god, terrible\\nrather than tender, and there had always been within him the old\\npagan scorn of everlasting mercy. There were moods even when he\\nfelt the kinship with his savage forefathers working in his\\nblood, and at such times he liked to fit heroic tortures to\\nheroic crimes to imagine the lighted stake and his enemy amid the\\nflames. Over him as he lay at full length the ancient cedars,\\ntouched here and there with a younger green, reared a dusky tent\\nthat screened him alike from the hot sunshine and the bright June\\nsky. Somewhere in the deepest shadow the mocking-bird purled over\\nits single note, and across the lettering on the marble slab\\nbeside him a small brown lizard was gliding back and forth. The\\nclean, fresh smell of the cedars filled his nostrils like a balm.\\n\\nFor a moment the physical pleasure in his surroundings possessed\\nhis thoughts; then gradually, in a state between waking and\\nsleeping, the curious boughs above took fantastic shapes and were\\ninterwoven before his eyes with his earlier memories. There was a\\ngreat tester bed, with carved posts and curtains of silvery\\ndamask, that he had slept in as a child, and it was here that he\\nhad once had a terrible dream--a dream which he had remembered to\\nthis day because it was so like a story of Aunt Delisha\\'s, in\\nwhich the devil comes with a red-hot scuttle to carry off a\\nlittle boy. On that night he had been the little boy, and he had\\nseen the scuttle with its leaping flames so plainly that in his\\nterror he had struggled up and screamed aloud. A moment later he\\nhad awakened fully, to find a lighted candle in his face and his\\nfather in a flowered dressing-gown sitting beside the bed and\\nlooking at him with his sad, bloodshot eyes. \"Is the devil gone,\\nfather, and did you drive him away?\" he asked; and then the tall,\\nwhite-haired old man, whose mind was fast decaying, did a strange\\nand a pitiable thing, for he fell upon his knees beside the bed\\nand cried out upon Christopher for forgiveness for the\\nselfishness\\nof his long life. \"You came too late, my son,\" he said; \"you came\\ntwenty years too late. I had given you up long ago and grown\\nhopeless. You came like Isaac to Abraham, but too late--too\\nlate!\" The boy sat up in bed, huddling in the bedclothes, for the\\nnight was chilly. He grew suddenly afraid of his father, the big,\\nbeautiful old man in the flowered dressing-gown, and he wished\\nthat his mother would come in and take him away. \"But I came\\ntwins with Lila, father,\" he replied, trying to speak bravely.\\n\"With Lila! Oh, my poor children! my poor children!\" cried the\\nold man, and, taking up his candle, tottered to the door. Then\\nChristopher stopped his ears in the pillows, for he heard him\\nmoaning to himself as he went back along the hall. He felt all at\\nonce terribly frightened, and at last, slipping down the tall\\nbed-steps, he stole on his bare feet to Cynthia\\'s door and crept\\nin beside her. After this, dim years went by when he did not see\\nhis father, and the great closed rooms on the north side of the\\nhouse were as silent as if a corpse lay there awaiting burial.\\nHis beautiful, stately mother, who, in spite of her gray hair,\\nhad always seemed but little older than himself, vanished as\\nmysteriously from his sight--on a thrilling morning when there\\nwere many waving red flags and much hurried marching by of\\ngray-clad troops. Young as he was, he was already beginning to\\nplay his boy\\'s share in a war which was then fighting slowly to a\\nfinish; and in the wild flutter of events he forgot, for a time,\\nto do more than tip softly when he crossed the hall. She was ill,\\nthey told him--too ill to care even about the battles that were\\nfought across the river. The sound of the big guns sent no\\ndelicious shivers through her limbs, and there was only Lila to\\ncome with him when he laid his ear to the ground and thrilled\\nwith the strong shock which seemed to run around the earth. When\\nat last her door was opened again and he went timidly in, holding\\nhands with Lila, he found his mother sitting stiffly erect among\\nher cushions as she would sit for the remainder of her days,\\nblind and half dead, in her Elizabethan chair. His beautiful,\\nproud mother, with the smiling Loves painted above her head!\\n\\nFor an instant he shut his eyes beneath the cedars, seeing her on\\nthat morning as a man sees in his dreams the face of his first\\nlove. Then another day dawned slowly to his consciousness--a day\\nwhich stood out clear-cut as a cameo from all the others of his\\nlife. For weeks Cynthia\\'s eyes had been red and swollen, and he\\ncommented querulously upon them, for they made her homelier than\\nusual. When he had finished, she looked at him a moment without\\nreplying, then, putting her arm about him, she drew him out upon\\nthe lawn and told him why she wept. It was a mellow autumn day,\\nand they passed over gold and russet leaves strewn deep along the\\npath. A light wind was blowing in the tree-tops, and the leaves\\nwere still falling, falling, falling! He saw Cynthia\\'s haggard\\nface in a flame of glowing colours. Through the drumming in his\\nears, which seemed to come from the clear sky, he heard the\\nceaseless rustle beneath his feet; and to this day he could not\\nwalk along a leaf-strewn road in autumn without seeing again the\\nblur of red-and-gold and the gray misery in Cynthia\\'s face.\\n\\n\"It will kill mother!\" he said angrily. \"It will kill mother!\\nWhy, she almost died when Docia broke her Bohemian bowl.\"\\n\\n\"She must never know,\" answered Cynthia, while the tears streamed\\nunheeded down her cheeks. \"When she is carried out one day for\\nher airing, she shall go back into the other house. It is a short\\ntime now at best--she may die at any moment from any shock--but\\nshe must die without knowing this. There must be quiet at the\\nend, at least. Oh, poor mother! poor mother!\"\\n\\nShe raised her hands to her convulsed face, and Christopher saw\\nthe tears trickle through her thin fingers,\\n\\n\"She must never know,\" repeated the boy. \"She must never know if\\nwe can help it.\"\\n\\n\"We must help it,\" cried Cynthia passionately. \"We must work our\\nfingers to the bone to help it, you and I.\"\\n\\n\"And Lila?\" asked the boy, curiously just even in the intensity\\nof his emotion. \"Mustn\\'t Lila work, too?\"\\n\\nCynthia sobbed--hard, strangling sobs that rattled like stones\\nwithin her bosom.\\n\\n\"Lila is only a girl,\" she said, \"and so pretty, so pretty.\"\\n\\nThe boy nodded.\\n\\n\"Then don\\'t let\\'s make Lila work,\" he responded sturdily.\\n\\nSelfish in her supreme unselfishness, the woman turned and kissed\\nhis brow, while he struggled, irritated, to keep her off.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let\\'s, dear,\" she said, and that was all.\\n\\n\\n\\nIX. Cynthia\\n\\nAs soon as Christopher had passed out of sight, Cynthia came from\\nthe kitchen with an armful of wet linen and began spreading it\\nupon some scrubby lilac bushes in a corner of the yard. After\\nfifteen years it still made her uncomfortable to have Christopher\\naround when she did the family washing, and when it was possible\\nshe waited to dry the clothes until he had gone back to the\\nfield. In her scant calico dress, with the furrows of age already\\nsettling about her mouth, and her pale brown hair strained in\\nthin peaks back from her forehead, she might have stood as the\\nworld-type of toil-worn womanhood, for she was of the stuff of\\nmartyrs, and the dignity of their high resolve was her one\\noutward grace. Life had been revealed to her as something to be\\nendured rather than enjoyed, and the softer adornments of her sex\\nhad not withstood the daily splashes of harsh soapsuds--they had\\nfaded like colours too delicate to stand the strain of ordinary\\nuse.\\n\\nAs she lifted one of her mother\\'s full white petticoats and\\nturned to wring it dry with her red and blistered hands, a look\\nthat was perilously near disgust was on her face--for though she\\nhad done her duty heroically and meant to do it until the end,\\nthere were brief moments when it sickened her to desperation. She\\nwas the kind of woman whose hands perform the more thoroughly\\nbecause the heart revolts against the task.\\n\\nLila, in her faded muslin which had taken the colours of November\\nleaves, came to the kitchen doorway and stood watching her with a\\ncheerful face.\\n\\n\"Has Jim Weatherby gone, Cynthia?\"\\n\\nCynthia nodded grimly, turning her squinting gaze upon her. \"Do\\nyou think I\\'d let him see me hanging out the clothes?\" she\\nsnapped. Supreme as her unselfishness was, there were times when\\nshe appeared to begrudge the least of her services; and after the\\nmanner of all affection that comes as a bounty, the unwilling\\nspirit was more impressive than the ready hand.\\n\\n\"I do wish you would make Docia help you,\" said Lila, in a voice\\nthat sounded as if she were speaking in her own defense.\\n\\nCynthia wrung out a blue jean shirt of Christopher\\'s, spread it\\non an old lilac-bush, and pushed a stray lock of hair back with\\nher wrist.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no use talking like that when you know Docia has heart\\ndisease and can\\'t scrub the clothes clean,\" she responded. \"If\\nshe\\'d drop down dead I\\'d like to know what we\\'d do with mother.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d help you if you\\'d only let me,\" protested Lila, on the\\npoint of tears. \"I\\'ve darned your lavender silk the best I could,\\nand I\\'d just as soon iron as not.\"\\n\\n\"And get your hands like mine in a week. No, I reckon it\\'s as\\nwell for one of us to keep decent. My hands are so knotted I had\\nto tell mother it was gout in the joints, and she said I must\\nhave been drinking too much port.\" She laughed, but her eyes\\nfilled with tears, and she wiped them with hard rubs on a twisted\\ngarment, which she afterward shook in the air to dry.\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re a saint, Cynthia, and I wish you weren\\'t,\" declared\\nLila almost impatiently. \"It makes me feel uncomfortable, as if\\nit were somehow my fault that you had to be so good.\"\\n\\n\"Being a saint is a good deal like being a woman, I reckon,\"\\nreturned Cynthia dryly. \"There\\'s a heap in having been born to\\nit. Aunt Polly, have you put the irons on the fire? The first\\nbatch of clothes is almost dry.\"\\n\\nAunt Polly, an aged crone, already stumbling into her dotage,\\nhobbled from the kitchen and gathered up an armful of resinous\\npine from a pile beside the steps. \"Dey\\'s \\'mos\\' es hot es de\\ndebbil\\'s wood en iron shovel,\" she replied, with one foot on the\\nstep; adding in a piercing whisper: \"I know dat ar shovel, honey,\\n\\'caze de debbil he done come fur me in de daid er de night,\\nlookin\\' moughty peart, too; but I tole \\'im he des better bide\\naw\\'ile \\'caze I \\'uz leanin\\' sorter favo\\'bly to\\'ad de Lawd.\"\\n\\n\"Aunt Polly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Take those\\nirons off and let them cool.\"\\n\\n\"Dat\\'s so, Miss Cynthy, en I\\'se right down \\'shamed er myse\\'f,\\nsho\\' \\'nough, but de shame er hit cyarn tu\\'n de heart er \\'ooman.\\n\\nDe debbil he sutnev did look young en peart, dat he did--en de\\nLawd He knows, Miss Cynthy, I allers did like \\'em young!

Lila was busily preparing a bowl of gruel for one of the\\nsick old Negroes who still lived upon the meager charity of the\\nBlakes.\\n\\n\"Mother wants you, Cynthia,\" she said. \"I won\\'t do at all, for\\nshe can\\'t be persuaded that I\\'m really grown up, you know. Here,\\ngive me some of those clothes. It won\\'t hurt my hands a bit.\"\\n\\nCynthia piled the clothes upon the board, and moistening her\\nfinger, applied it to the bottom of the iron. Then she handed it\\nto Lila with a funny little air of anxiety. \"This is just right,\"\\nshe said; \"be careful not to get your fingers burned, and\\nremember to sprinkle the clothes well. Do you know what mother\\nwants?\"\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s about taking something to Aunt Dinah. Docia told\\nher she was sick.\"\\n\\n\"Then I wish Docia would learn to hold her tongue,\" commented\\nCynthia, as she left the kitchen.\\n\\nShe found Mrs. Blake looking slightly irritated as she wound a\\nball of white yarn from a skein that Docia was holding between\\nher outstretched hands.\\n\\n\"I hear Dinah is laid up with a stitch in her chest, Cynthia,\"\\nshe said. \"You must look in the medicine closet and give her ten\\ngrains of quinine and a drink of whisky. Tell her to keep well\\ncovered up, and see that Polly makes her hot flaxseed tea every\\ntwo hours.\"\\n\\n\"Lila is fixing her some gruel now, mother.\"\\n\\n\"I said flaxseed tea, my dear. I am almost seventy years old, and\\nI have treated three hundred servants and seen sixty laid in\\ntheir graves, but if you think you are a better doctor than I am,\\nof course there\\'s nothing to be said. Docia, hold the yarn a\\nlittle tighter.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll make the flaxseed tea at once, and I\\'ll carry it right\\nover--a breath of air will do me good.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blake sighed. \"You mustn\\'t stay too closely with me,\" she\\nsaid; \"you will grow old before your time, I fear. As it is you\\nhave given up your young life to my poor old one.\"\\n\\n\"I had nothing to give up, mother,\" replied Cynthia quietly, and\\nin the few words her heart\\'s tragedy was written--since of all\\nlives, the saddest is the one that can find nothing worthy of\\nrenouncement. There were hours when she felt that any bitter\\npersonal past--that the recollection of a single despairing kiss\\nor a blighted love would have filled her days with happiness.\\nWhat she craved was the conscious dignity of a broken heart--some\\nlofty memory that she might rest upon in her hours of weakness.\\n\\n\"Well, you might have had, my child,\" returned her mother.\\n\\nCynthia\\'s only answer was to smooth gently the pillows in the old\\nlady\\'s chair. \"If you could learn to lean back, dearest, it would\\nrest you so,\" she said.\\n\\n\"I have never slouched in my life,\" replied Mrs. Blake\\ndecisively, \"and I do not care to fall into the habit in my\\nseventieth year. When my last hour comes, I hope at least to meet\\nmy God in the attitude becoming a lady, and in my day it would\\nhave been considered the height of impropriety to loll in a chair\\nor even to rock in the presence of gentlemen. Your Greataunt\\nSusannah, one of the most modest women of her time, has often\\ntold me that once, having unfortunately crossed her knees in the\\nparlour after supper, she suffered untold tortures from \"budges\"\\nfor three mortal hours rather than be seen to do anything so\\nindelicate as to uncross them. Well, well, ladies were ladies in\\nthose days, and now Lila tells me it is quite customary for them\\nto sit like men. My blindness has spared me many painful sights,\\nI haven\\'t a doubt.\"\\n\\n\"Things have changed, dear. I wish they hadn\\'t. I liked the old\\ndays, too.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad at least to hear you say so. Your Aunt Susannah--and\\nshe was the one who danced a minuet with General Lafayette, you\\nknow--used to say that patience and humility became a gentlewoman\\nbetter than satin and fine lace. She was a lady of fashion and a\\ngreat beauty, so I suppose her opinion counts for something--\\nespecially as she was noted for being the proudest woman of her\\nday, and it was said that she never danced with a gentleman who\\nhadn\\'t fought a duel on her account. When she went to a ball it\\ntook six small darkies to carry her train, and her escort was\\nalways obliged to ride on top of the coach to keep from rumpling\\nthe flounces of her petticoat. They always said that I had\\ninherited something of her face and step.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure she was never so beautiful as you, mother.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well, every one to his taste, my child; and I have heard\\nthat she wore a larger shoe. However, this is foolish chatter,\\nand a waste of time. Go and carry Dinah the medicine, and let me\\nsee Christopher as soon as he comes in. By the way, Cynthia, have\\nyou noticed whether he seeks the society of ladies? Do you think\\nit likely that his affections are engaged?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, not at all. He doesn\\'t care for girls; I\\'m sure of it.\"\\n\\n\"That seems very strange. Why, at his age, his father had been\\nthe object of a dozen love affairs, and been jilted twice, report\\nwent, though I had my suspicion from the first that it was the\\nother way. Certainly Miss Peggie Stuart (and he had once been\\nengaged to her) went into a decline immediately after our\\nmarriage--but in affairs of the heart, as I have mentioned often\\nbefore, the only reliable witnesses are those who never tell what\\nthey know. Now, as for Christopher, are you quite sure he is as\\nhandsome as you say?\" \"Quite, quite, he\\'s splendid--like the\\npicture of the young David in the Bible.\" \"Then there\\'s something\\nwrong. Does he cough?\" \"His health seems perfect.\" \"Which proves\\nconclusively that he cherishes a secret feeling. For a man to go\\ntwenty-six years without falling in love means that he\\'s either a\\nsaint or an imbecile, my dear; and for my part, I declare I don\\'t\\nknow which character sits worse upon a gentleman. Can it be one\\nof the Morrisons, do you think? The youngest girl used to be\\nconsidered something of a beauty by the family; though she was\\nalways too namby-pamby for my taste.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s fifty by now, if she\\'s a day, mother, and the only thing I\\never saw Christopher do for her was to drive a strange bull out\\nof her road.\" \"Well, that sounds romantic; but I fear, as you\\nsay, she\\'s really too old for him. How time does fly.\" Cynthia\\nstooped and carefully arranged the old lady\\'s feet upon the\\nottoman. \"There, now--I\\'ll carry the medicine to Aunt Dinah,\" she\\nsaid, \"and be back in plenty of time to dress for supper.\" She\\nfound the quinine in an old medicine chest in the adjoining room,\\nand went with it to one of the crumbling cabins which had formed\\npart of the \"quarters\" in the prosperous days of slavery. Aunt\\nDinah insisted upon detaining her for a chat, and it was half an\\nhour afterward that she came out again and walked slowly back\\nalong the little falling path. The mild June breeze freshened her\\nhot cheeks, and as she passed thoughtfully between the coarse\\nsprays of yarrow blooming along the ragged edges of the fields\\nshe felt her spirit freed from the day\\'s burden of unrest. What\\nshe wanted just then was to lie for an hour close upon the\\nground, to renew the vital forces within her by contact with the\\ninvigorating earth--to feel Nature at friendly touch with her\\nlips and hands. She would have liked to run like a wild thing\\nthrough the golden sunshine lying upon the yarrow, following the\\nshy cries of the partridges that scattered at her approach--but\\nthere was work for her inside the house, so she went back\\npatiently to take it up. As she entered the little yard, she saw\\nTucker basking in the sunshine on an old bench beside one of the\\ndamask rose-bushes, and she crossed over and stood for a moment\\nin the tall grass before him. \"You look so happy, Uncle Tucker.\\nHow do you manage it?\" \"By keeping so, I reckon, my dear. I tell\\nyou, this sun feels precious good on the back.\" She dropped\\nlimply on the bench beside him. \"Yes, it is pleasant, but I\\nhadn\\'t thought of it.\" \" Well, you\\'d think of it often enough if\\nyou were in my place,\" pursued Tucker, always garrulous, and\\ngrateful for a listener. \"I didn\\'t notice things much myself when\\nI was young. The only sights that seemed to count, somehow, were\\nthose I saw inside my head, and if you\\'ll believe me, I used to\\nbe moody and out of sorts half the time, just like Christopher.\\nTimes have changed now, you\\'ll say, and it\\'s true. Why, I\\'ve got\\nnothing to do these days but to take a look at things, and I tell\\nyou I see a lot now where all was a blank before. You just glance\\nover that old field and tell me what you find,\" Cynthia followed\\nthe sweep of his left arm. \"There\\'s first the road, and then a\\npiece of fallow land that ought to be ploughed,\" she said. \"Bless\\nmy soul, is that all you see? Why, there is every shade of green\\non earth in that old field, and almost every one of blue, except\\nazure, which you\\'ll find up in the sky. That little bit of white\\ncloud, no bigger than my hand, is shaped exactly like an eagle\\'s\\nwing. I\\'ve watched it for an hour, and I never saw one like it.\\nAs for that old pine on top the little knoll, if you look at it\\nlong enough you\\'ll see that it\\'s a great big green cross raised\\nagainst the sky.\" \"So it is, \" said Cynthia, in surprise; \"so it\\nis.\"\\n\\n\"Then to come nearer, look at that spray of turtlehead growing by\\nthat gray stone--the shadow it throws is as fine as thread lace,\\nand it waves in the breeze just like the flower.\"\\n\\n\" Oh, it is beautiful, and I never should have seen it.\"\\n\\n\"And best of all,\" resumed Tucker, as if avoiding an\\ninterruption, \"is that I\\'ve watched a nestful of young wrens take\\nflight from under the eaves. There\\'s not a play of Shakespeare\\'s\\ngreater than that, I tell you.\" \"And it makes you happy--just\\nthis?\" asked Cynthia wistfully, as the pathos of his maimed\\nfigure drove to her heart. \"Well, I reckon happiness is not so\\nmuch in what comes as in the way you take it,\" he returned,\\nsmiling. \"There was a time, you must remember, when I was the\\nstraightest shot of my day, and something of a lady-killer as\\nwell, if I do say it who shouldn\\'t. I\\'ve done my part in a war\\nand I\\'m not ashamed of it. I\\'ve taken the enemy\\'s cannon under a\\nfire hot enough to roast an ox, and I\\'ve sent more men to\\neternity than I like to think of; but I tell you honestly there\\'s\\nno battle-field under heaven worth an hour of this old bench. If\\nI had my choice to-day, I\\'d rather see the flitting of those\\nwrens than kill the biggest Yankee that ever lived. The time was\\nwhen I didn\\'t think so, but I know now that there\\'s as much life\\nout there in that old field as in the tightest-packed city street\\nI ever saw--purer life, praise God, and sweeter to the taste.\\nWhy, look at this poplar leaf that blew across the road; I\\'ve\\nstudied the pattern of it for half an hour, and I\\'ve found out\\nthat such a wonder is worth going ten miles to see.\" \"Oh, I can\\'t\\nunderstand you,\" sighed Cynthia hopelessly. \"I wish I could, but\\nI can\\'t--I was born different--so different.\" \"Bless your heart,\\nhoney, I was born different myself, and if I\\'d kept my leg and my\\narm I dare say I\\'d be strutting round on one and shaking the\\nother in the face of God Almighty just as I used to do. A\\ntwo-legged man is so busy getting about the world that he never\\nhas time to sit down and take a look around him. I tell you I see\\nmore in one hour as I am now than I saw in all the rest of my\\nlife when I was sound and whole. Why, I could sit here all day\\nlong and stare up at that blue sky, and then go to bed feeling\\nthat my twelve hours were full and brimming over. If I\\'d never\\nseen anything in my life but that sky above the old pine, I\\nshould say at the end \\'Thank God for that one good look.\\'\" \"I\\ncan\\'t understand--I can\\'t understand,\" repeated Cynthia, in a\\nbroken voice, though her face shed a clear, white beam. \"I only\\nknow that we are all in awful straights, and that to-morrow is\\nthe day when I must get up at five o\\'clock and travel all the way\\nto town to get my sewing.\" He laid his large pink hand on hers,\\n\"Why not let Lila go for you?\" \"What! to wait like a servant for\\nthe bundle and walk the streets all day--I\\'d go twenty times\\nfirst!\" \"My dear, you needn\\'t envy me,\" he responded, patting her\\nknotted hand. \"I took less courage with me when I stormed my\\nheights.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. Sentimental and Otherwise\\n\\nIn the gray dawn Cynthia came softly downstairs and, passing her\\nmother\\'s door on tiptoe, went out into the kitchen to begin\\npreparations for her early breakfast. She wore a severe black\\nalpaca dress, made from a cast-off one of her mother\\'s, and below\\nher white linen collar she had pinned a cameo brooch bearing the\\nhead of Minerva, which had once belonged to Aunt Susannah. On the\\nbed upstairs she had left her shawl and bonnet and a pair of\\ncarefully mended black silk mitts, for her monthly visits to the\\nlittle country town were endured with something of the frozen\\ndignity which supported Marie Antoinette in the tumbrel. It was a\\ncase where family pride was found more potent than Christian\\nresignation. When she opened the kitchen door, with her arms full\\nof resinous pine from the pile beside the steps, she found that\\nTucker had risen before her and was fumbling awkwardly in the\\nsafe with his single hand. \"Why, Uncle Tucker!\" she exclaimed in\\nsurprise, \"what on earth has happened?\" Turning his cheerful face\\nupon her, he motioned to a little wooden tobacco box on the bare\\ntable. \"A nest full of swallows tumbled down my chimney log in\\nthe night,\" he explained, \"and they cried so loud I couldn\\'t\\nsleep, so I thought I might as well get up and dig \\'em a worm or\\ntwo. Do you happen to know where a bit of wool is?\" Cynthia threw\\nher bundle of kindling-wood on the hearth and stood regarding him\\nwith apathetic eyes. \"You\\'d much better wring their necks,\" she\\nresponded indifferently; \"but there\\'s a basketful of wool Aunt\\nPolly has just carded in the closet. How in the world did you\\nmanage to dress yourself?\" \"Oh, it\\'s wonderful what one hand can\\ndo when it\\'s put to it. Would you mind fastening my collar, by\\nthe way, and any buttons that you happen to see loose?\" She\\nglanced over him critically, pulling his clothes in place and\\nadjusting a button here and there. \"I do hate to see you in this\\nold jean suit,\" she said; \"you used to look so nice in your other\\nclothes.\" With a laugh he settled his empty sleeve. \"Oh, they\\'re\\ngood for warm weather,\" he responded; \"and they wash easily,\\nwhich is something. Think, too, what a waste it would be to dress\\nhalf a man in a whole suit of broadcloth.\" \"Oh, don\\'t, don\\'t,\"\\nshe protested, on the point of tears, but he smiled and patted\\nher bowed shoulder. \"I got over that long ago, honey,\" he said\\ngently. \"I kicked powerful hard with my one foot at first, but\\nthe dust I raised wasn\\'t a speck in the face of God Almighty.\\nThere, there, we\\'ll have a fine sunrise, and I\\'m going out to\\nwatch it from my old bench--unless you\\'ll find something for a\\nsingle hand to do.\" She shook her head, smiling with misty eyes.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have breakfast with me, I suppose,\" she said. \"I got up\\nearly because I couldn\\'t sleep, but it\\'s not yet four o\\'clock.\"\\nFor an instant he looked at her gravely. \"Worrying about the\\nday?\" \"A little.\" \"If I could only manage to hobble along with\\nyou.\" \"Oh, but you couldn\\'t, dear--and the worst of it is having\\nto wait so long in town for the afternoon stage. I get my sewing,\\nand then I eat my lunch on the old church steps, and then there\\nare four mortal hours when I walk about aimlessly in the sun.\"\\n\"And you wouldn\\'t go to see anybody?\" \"With my bundle of work,\\nand in this alpaca? Not for worlds!\" He sighed, not\\nreproachfully, but with the sympathy which projects itself into\\nstates of feeling other than its own. \"Well, I wish all the same\\nyou\\'d let Lila go in with you. I think you make a mistake about\\nher, Cynthia; she wouldn\\'t feel the strain of it half so much as\\nyou do.\"\\n\\n\"But I\\'d feel it for her. No, no, it\\'s better as it is; and she\\ndoes walk to the cross-roads with me, you know. Old Jacob\\nWeatherby brings her back in his wagon. Christopher can\\'t get\\noff, but he\\'ll come for me at sundown.\" \"Are you sure it isn\\'t\\nyoung Jim who fetches Lila?\" She frowned. \"If it were young Jim,\\nher going would be impossible--but the old man knows his place\\nand keeps it.\" \"It\\'s a better place than ours to-day, I reckon,\"\\nreturned Tucker, smiling. \"To an observer across the road I dare\\nsay the odds would seem considerably in his favour. I met him in\\nthe turnpike last Sunday in a brand new broadcloth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I can\\'t bear to hear you,\" returned Cynthia passionately.\\n\"If we must go to the dogs, for heaven\\'s sake, let\\'s go\\nremembering that we are Blakes--or Corbins, if you like.\"\\n\\n\"Bless your heart, child, I\\'d just as lief remember I was a Blake\\nor even a Weatherby, for that matter. Why, Jacob Weatherby\\'s\\ngrandfather was an honest, self-respecting tiller of the soil\\nwhen mine used to fish his necktie out of the punch bowl every\\nSaturday night, people said.\"\\n\\nShe lifted her black skirt above her knees, and pinned it tightly\\nat her back with a large safety pin she had taken from her bosom.\\nThen kneeling on the hearth, she laid the knots of resinous pine\\non a crumpled newspaper in the great stone fireplace.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mind your picking flaws in me,\" she said dryly, \"but I\\ndo wish you would let my great grandfather rest in his grave.\\nHe\\'s about all I\\'ve got.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I beg his pardon for speaking the truth about him,\"\\nreturned Tucker penitently; \"and now my swallows are so noisy I\\nmust stop their mouths.\"\\n\\nHe went out humming a tune, while Cynthia hung the boiler from\\nthe crane and mixed the corn-meal dough in a wooden tray.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was on the table Lila appeared with a reproachful\\nface, hurriedly knotting her kerchief as she entered.\\n\\n\"Oh, Cynthia, you promised to let me get breakfast,\" she said.\\n\"Mother was very restless all night--she dreamed that she was\\nbeing married over again--so I slept too late.\"\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t matter, dear; I was awake, and I didn\\'t mind getting\\nup. Are you ready to go?\"\\n\\n\"All except my hat.\" Yawning slightly, she raised her hands and\\npushed up her clustering hair that was but a shade darker than\\nChristopher\\'s. Trivial as the likeness was, it began and ended\\nwith her heavy curls, for her hazel eyes held a peculiar liquid\\nbeam, and her face, heart-shaped in outline, had none of the\\nheaviness of jaw which marred the symmetry of his. A little brown\\nmole beside the dimple in her cheek gave the finishing touch of\\ncoquetry to the old-world quaintness of her appearance.\\n\\nAs she passed the window on her way to the table she threw a\\ndrowsy glance out into the yard.\\n\\n\"Why, there\\'s Uncle Tucker sitting on the ground,\" she said; \"he\\nmust be crazy.\"\\n\\nCynthia was pouring the hastily made coffee from the steaming\\nboiler, and she did not look up as she answered.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better go out and help him up. He\\'s digging worms for some\\nswallows that fell down his chimney.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of all the ideas!\" exclaimed Lila, laughing, but she went\\nout with cheerful sweetness and assisted him to his crutches.\\n\\nA half-hour later, when the meal was over and Christopher had\\ngone out to the stable, the two women tied on their bonnets and\\nwent softly through the hall. As they passed Mrs. Blake\\'s door\\nshe awoke and called out sharply. \"Cynthia, is that you? What are\\nyou doing up so early?\" Cynthia paused at strained attention on\\nthe threshold. \"I\\'m going to the Morrisons\\', mother, to spend the\\nday. You know I told you Miss Martha had promised to teach me\\nthat new fancy stitch.\" \"But, my dear, surely it is bad manners\\nto arrive before eleven o\\'clock. I remember once when I was a\\ngirl that we went over to Meadow Hall before ten in the morning,\\nand found old Mrs. Dudley just putting on her company cap.\" \"But\\nthey begged me to come to breakfast, dear.\" \"Well, customs\\nchange, of course; but be sure to take Mrs. Morrison a jar of the\\ngreen tomato catchup. You know she always fancied it.\" \"Yes, yes;\\ngood-by till evening.\" She moved on hurriedly, her clumsy shoes\\ncreaking on the bare planks, and a moment afterward as the door\\nclosed behind them they passed out into the first sunbeams.\\nBeyond the whitewashed fence the old field was silvered by the\\nheavy dew, and above it the great pine towered like a burnished\\ncross upon the western sky. To the eastward a solitary thrush was\\nsinging--a golden voice straight from out the sunrise. \"This is\\nworth getting up for!\" said Lila, with a long, joyful breath; and\\nshe broke into a tender carolling as spontaneous as the bird\\'s.\\nThe bloom of the summer was in her face, and as she moved with\\nher buoyant step along the red clay road she was like a rare\\nflower blown lightly by the wind. To Cynthia\\'s narrowed eyes she\\nseemed, indeed, a heroine descended from old romance--a maiden to\\nwhom, even in these degenerate modern days, there must at last\\narrive a noble destiny. That Lila at the end of her twenty-six\\nyears should have wearied of her long waiting and grown content\\nto compromise with fate would have appeared to her impossible--as\\nimpossible as the transformation of young Jim Weatherby into the\\nfairy prince.\\n\\n\"Hush!\" she said suddenly, shifting her bundle of sewing from one\\narm to the other; \"there\\'s a wagon turning from the branch road.\"\\nThey had reached the first bend beyond the gate, and as they\\nrounded the long curve, hidden by honey-locusts, a light spring\\nwagon came rapidly toward them, with Jim Weatherby, in his Sunday\\nclothes, on the driver\\'s seat. \"Father\\'s rheumatism is so bad he\\ncouldn\\'t get out to-day,\" he explained, as he brought the horses\\nto a stand; \"so as long as I had to take the butter over, I\\nthought I might save you the five miles.\" He spoke to Cynthia,\\nand she drew back stiffly. \"It is a pleasant day for a walk,\" she\\nreturned dryly. \"But it\\'s going to be hot,\" he urged; \"I can tell\\nby the way the sun licks up the dew.\" A feathery branch of the\\nhoney-locust was in his face, and he pushed it impatiently aside\\nas he looked at Lila. \"I waited late just to take you,\" he added\\nwistfully, jumping from his seat and going to the horses\\' heads.\\n\"Won\\'t you get in?\" \"You will be so tired, Cynthia,\" Lila\\npersuaded. \"Think of the walking you have to do in town.\" As Jim\\nWeatherby glanced up brightly from the strap he was fastening,\\nthe smile in his blue eyes was like a song of love; and when the\\ngirl met it she heard again the solitary thrush singing in the\\nsunrise. \"You will come?\" he pleaded, and this time he looked\\nstraight at her.\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon I will, if you\\'re going anyway,\" said Cynthia at\\nlast; \"and if I drive with you there\\'ll be no use for Lila to go\\nshe can stay with mother.\"\\n\\n\"But mother doesn\\'t need me,\" said Lila, in answer to Jim\\'s\\nwistful eyes; \"and it\\'s such a lovely day--after getting up so\\nearly I don\\'t want to stay indoors.\"\\n\\nWithout a word Jim held out his band to Cynthia, and she climbed,\\nwith unbending dignity, to the driver\\'s seat. \"You know you\\'ve\\ngot that dress to turn, Lila,\" she said, as she settled her stiff\\nskirt primly over her knees.\\n\\n\"I can do it when I get home,\" answered Lila, laying her hand on\\nthe young man\\'s arm and stepping upon the wheel. \"Where shall I\\nsit, Jim?\"\\n\\nCynthia turned and looked at her coldly.\\n\\n\"You\\'d be more comfortable in that chair at the back,\" she\\nsuggested, and Lila sat down obediently in the little\\nsplitbottomed chair between a brown stone jar of butter and a\\nbasket filled with new-laid eggs. The girl folded her white hands\\nin the lap of her faded muslin and listened patiently to the\\npleasant condescension in Cynthia\\'s voice as she discussed the\\nbelated planting of the crops. As the spring wagon rolled in the\\nshade of the honey-locusts between the great tobacco fields,\\nstriped with vivid green, the June day filled the younger\\nsister\\'s eyes with a radiance that seemed but a reflection of its\\nown perfect beauty. Not once did her lover turn from Cynthia to\\nherself, but she was conscious, sitting quietly beside the great\\nbrown jar, that for him she filled the morning with her\\npresence--that he saw her in the blue sky, in the sunny fields,\\nand in the long red road with the delicate shadowing of the\\nlocusts. In her cramped life there had been so little room in\\nwhich her dreams might wander that gradually the romantic\\ndevotion of her old playmate had grown to represent the measure\\nof her emotional ideal. In spite of her poetic face she was in\\nthought soundly practical, and though the plain Cynthia might\\nsend a fanciful imagination in pursuit of the impossible, to Lila\\nthe only destiny worth cherishing at heart was the one that drew\\nits roots deep from the homely soil about her. The stern class\\ndistinctions which had always steeled Cynthia against the\\nfriendly advances of her neighbours troubled the younger sister\\nnot at all. She remembered none of the past grandeur, the old\\nBlake power of rule, and the stories of gallant indiscretions and\\npowdered beaux seemed to her as worthless as the moth-eaten satin\\nrags which filled the garret. She loved the familiar country\\nchildren, the making of fresh butter, and honest admiration of\\nher beauty; and except for the colourless poverty in which they\\nlived, she might easily have found her placid happiness on the\\nlittle farm. With ambition--the bitter, agonised ambition that\\nCynthia felt for her--she was as unconcerned as was her blithe\\nyoung lover chatting so merrily in the driver\\'s seat. The very\\ndullness of her imagination had saved her from the awakening that\\nfollows wasted hopes.\\n\\n\"The tobacco looks well,\" Cynthia was saying in her formal tones;\\n\"all it needs now is a rain to start it growing. You\\'ve got yours\\nall in by now, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; mine was put in before Christopher\\'s,\" responded Jim,\\nfeeling instantly that the woman beside him flinched at his\\nunconscious use of her brother\\'s name.\\n\\n\"He is always late,\" she remarked with forced politeness, and the\\nconversation dragged until they reached the cross-roads and she\\nclimbed into the stage.\\n\\n\"Be sure to hurry back,\" were her last words as she rumbled off;\\nand when, in looking over her shoulder at the first curve, she\\nsaw Lila lift her beaming eyes to Jim Weatherby\\'s face, the\\nprotest of all the dust in the old graveyard was in the groan\\nthat hovered on her lips. She herself would have crucified her\\nhappiness with her own loyal hands rather than have dishonoured\\nby so much as an unspoken hope the high excellences inscribed\\nupon the tombstones of those mouldered dead.\\n\\nIn her shabby black dress, with her heavy bundle under her arm,\\nshe passed, a lonely, pathetic figure, through the streets of the\\nlittle town. The strange smells fretted her, the hot bricks tired\\nher feet, and the jarring noises confused her hazy ideas of\\ndirection. On the steps of the old church, where she ate her\\nlunch, she found a garrulous blind beggar with whom she divided\\nher slender meal of bacon and cornbread. After a moment\\'s\\nhesitation, she bought a couple of bananas for a few cents from a\\nfruit-stand at the corner, and coming back, gave the larger one\\nto the beggar who sat complaining in the sun. Then, withdrawing\\nto a conventional distance in the shadow of the steeple, she\\nwaited patiently for the slow hours to wear away. Not until the\\nlong shadow pointed straight from west to east did the ancient\\nvehicle rattle down the street and the driver pull up for her at\\nthe old church steps. Then it was that with her first sigh of\\nrelief she awoke to the realisation that through all the trying\\nday her heaviest burden was the memory of Lila\\'s morning look\\ninto the face of the man whose father had been a common labourer\\nat Blake Hall.\\n\\nThree hours later, when, pale and exhausted, with an aching head,\\nshe found the stage halting beneath the blasted pine, her\\npleasantest impression was of Christopher standing in the yellow\\nafterglow beside the old spring wagon. The driver spoke to him,\\nand then, as the horses stopped, turned to toss the\\nweather-beaten mail-bag to the porch of the country store, where\\na group of men were lounging. Among them Cynthia saw the figure\\nof a girl in a riding habit, who, as the stage halted, gathered\\nup her long black skirt and ran hastily to the roadside to speak\\nto some one who remained still seated in the vehicle.\\n\\nThat Christopher\\'s eyes followed the graceful figure in its\\nfinely fitting habit Cynthia noticed with a sudden jealous pang,\\ndetecting angrily the warmth of the admiration in his gaze. The\\ngirl had met his look, she knew, for when she lifted her face to\\nher companion it was bright with a winter\\'s glow, though the day\\nwas warm. She spoke almost breathlessly, too, as if she had been\\nrunning, and Cynthia overhearing her first low words, held her\\nprim skirt aside, and descended awkwardly over the wheel. She\\nstumbled in reaching the ground, and the girl with a kindly\\nmovement turned to help her. \"I hope you aren\\'t hurt,\" she said\\nin crisp, clearcut tones; but the elder woman, recovering herself\\nwith an effort, passed on after an ungracious bow. When she\\nreached Christopher he was still standing motionless beside the\\nwagon, and at her first words he started like one awaking from a\\npleasant daydream. \"So you came, after all,\" he remarked in an\\nabsent-minded manner. \"Of course I came.\" She was conscious that\\nshe almost snapped the reply. \"Did you expect me to spend the\\nnight in town?\" \"In town? Hardly.\" He laughed gaily as he helped\\nher into the wagon; then, with the reins in his hands, he turned\\nfor a last glance at the stage. \"Why, what did you think I was\\nwaiting for?\" \"What you are waiting for now is more to the\\npurpose,\" she retorted, pressing her fingers upon her aching\\ntemples. \"The afterglow is fading; come, get in.\"\\n\\nWithout a word he seated himself beside her, and as he touched\\nthe horses lightly with the whip the wagon rolled between the\\ngreen tobacco fields. \"How delicious the wild grape is!\"\\nexclaimed Cynthia, drawing her breath, \"I hope the horses aren\\'t\\ntired. Have they been at the plough?\" \"Not since dinner time.\" It\\nwas clear that his mind was still abstracted, and he kept his\\nface turned toward the pale red line that lingered on the western\\nhorizon. \"This is a queer kind of life,\" he said presently, still\\nlooking away from her. \"We are so poor and so shut in that we\\nhave no idea what people of the world are really like. That girl\\nout there at the cross-roads, now, she was different from any one\\nI\\'d ever seen. Did you hear where she came from?\" \"I didn\\'t ask,\"\\nCynthia replied, compressing her lips. \"I didn\\'t like the way she\\nstared.\" \"Stared? At you?\" \"No, at you. I\\'m glad you didn\\'t\\nnotice it. It was bold, to say the least.\" Throwing back his\\nhead, he laughed with boyish merriment; and she saw, as he turned\\nhis face toward her, that his heavy hair had fallen low across\\nhis forehead, giving him a youthful look that became him\\nstrangely. At the instant she softened in her judgment of the\\nunknown woman at the cross-roads. \"Why, she thought I was some\\nqueer beast of burden, I reckon,\" he returned, \"some new farm\\nanimal that made her a little curious. Well, whoever she may be,\\nshe walked as if she felt herself a princess.\" Cynthia snorted.\\n\"Her habit fitted her like a glove,\" was her comment, to which\\nshe added after a pause: \"As things go, it\\'s just as well you\\ndidn\\'t hear what she said, I reckon.\" \"About me, do you mean?\"\\n\"She came down to meet another girl,\" pursued Cynthia coolly. \"I\\nwas getting out, so I don\\'t suppose they noticed me--a shabby old\\ncreature with a bundle. At any rate, when she kissed the other,\\nshe whispered something I didn\\'t hear, and then, \\'I\\'ve seen that\\nman before--look!\\' That was when I stumbled, and that made me\\ncatch the next \\'Where?\\' her friend asked her quickly, and she\\nanswered....\" There was a pause, in which the warm dusk was\\nsaturated with the fragrance of the grape blossoms on the fence.\\n\"She answered?\" repeated Christopher slowly. Cynthia looked up\\nand down the road, and then gave the words as if they were a\\ngroan: \"In my dreams.\"\\n\\n\\nBOOK II . THE TEMPTATION\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I. The Romance that Might have Been\\n\\nWith July there came a long rain, and in the burst of sunshine\\nwhich followed it the young tobacco shot up fine and straight and\\ntall, clothing the landscape in a rich, tropical green.\\n\\n>From morning till night the men worked now in the great fields,\\nremoving the numerous \"suckers\" from the growing plants, and\\npinching off the slender tops to prevent the first beginnings of\\na flower, except where, at long spaces, a huge pink cluster would\\nbe allowed to blossom and come to seed.\\n\\nChristopher, toiling all day alone in his own field, felt the\\nclear summer dawn break over him, the golden noon gather to full\\nheat, and the coming night envelop him like a purple mist.\\nLiving, as he did, so close to the earth, himself akin to the\\nstrong forces of the soil, he had grown gradually from his\\nchildhood into a rare physical expression of the large freedom of\\nnatural things.\\n\\nIt was an unusually hot day in mid-August--the time of the\\nharvest moon and of the dreaded tobacco fly--that he came home at\\nthe dinner hour to find Cynthia standing, spent and pale, beside\\nthe well.\\n\\n\"The sun is awful, Christopher; I don\\'t see how you bear it but\\nit makes your hair the colour of ripe wheat.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind the sun,\" he answered, laughing as he wiped the\\nsweat from his face and stooped for a drink from the tilted\\nbucket. \"I\\'m too much taken up just now with fighting those\\nconfounded tobacco flies. They were as thick as thieves last\\nnight.\"\\n\\n\"Uncle Boaz is going to send the little darkies out to hunt them\\nat sundown,\" returned Cynthia. \"I\\'ve promised them an apple for\\nevery one they catch.\"\\n\\nHer gaze wandered over the broad fields, rich in promise, and she\\nadded after a moment, \"Fletcher\\'s crop has come on splendidly.\"\\n\\n\"The more\\'s the pity.\"\\n\\nFor a long breath she looked at him in silence; at the massive\\nfigure, the face burned to the colour of terra-cotta, the thick,\\nwheaten-brown hair then, with an impulsive gesture, she spoke in\\nher wonderful voice, which held so many possibilities of passion:\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t tell you, Christopher, that I\\'d found out the name of\\nthe girl at the cross-roads. She went away the day afterward and\\njust got back yesterday.\"\\n\\nSomething in her tone made the young man look up quickly, his\\nface paling beneath the sunburn.\\n\\nAll the boyish cheerfulness he had worn of late faded suddenly\\nfrom his look.\\n\\n\"Who is she?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Jim Weatherby knew. He had seen her several times on horseback,\\nand he says she\\'s Maria Fletcher, that ugly little girl, grown\\nup. She hates the life here, he says, and they think she is going\\nto marry before the winter. Fletcher was talking down at the\\nstore about a rich man who is in love with her.\"\\n\\nChristopher stooped to finish his drink, and then rose slowly to\\nhis full height.\\n\\n\"Well, one Fletcher the less will be a good riddance,\" he said\\nharshly, as he went into the house.\\n\\nIn the full white noon he returned to the field, working steadily\\non his crop until the sunset. Back and forth among the tall green\\nplants, waist deep in their rank luxuriance, he passed with\\ncareful steps and attentive eyes, avoiding the huge \"sand leaves\"\\nspreading upon the ground and already yellowing in the August\\nweather. As he searched for the hidden \"suckers\" along the great\\njuicy stalks, he removed his hat lest it should bruise the tender\\ntops, and the golden sunshine shone full on his bared head.\\n\\nAround him the landscape swept like an emerald sea, over which\\nthe small shadows rippled in passing waves, beginning at the rail\\nfence skirting the red clay road and breaking at last upon the\\ndarker green of the far-off pines. Here and there a tall pink\\nblossom rose like a fantastic sail from the deep and rocked\\nslowly to and fro in the summer wind. When at last the sun\\ndropped behind the distant wood and a red flame licked at the\\nwestern clouds, he still lingered on, dreaming idly, while his\\nhands followed their accustomed task. Big green moths hovered\\npresently around him, seeking the deep rosy tubes of the\\nclustered flowers, and alighting finally to leave their\\ndanger-breeding eggs under the drooping leaves. The sound of\\nlaughter floated suddenly from the small Negro children, who were\\npursuing the tobacco flies between the furrows. He had ceased\\nfrom his work, and come out into the little path that trailed\\nalong the edge of the field, when he saw a woman\\'s figure, in a\\ngown coloured like April flowers, pass from the new road over the\\nloosened fence-rails. For a breathless instant he wavered in the\\npath; then turning squarely, he met her questioning look with\\nindifferent eyes. The new romance had shriveled at the first\\ntouch of the old hatred. Maria, holding her skirt above her\\nruffled petticoat, stood midway of the little trail, a single\\ntobacco blossom waving over her leghorn hat. She was no longer\\nthe pale girl who had received Carraway with so composed a\\nbearing, for her face and her gown were now coloured delicately\\nwith an April bloom. \"I followed the new road,\" she explained,\\nsmiling, \"and all at once it ended at the fence. Where can I take\\nit up again?\" He regarded her gravely. \"The only way you can take\\nit up again is to go back to it,\" he answered. \"It doesn\\'t cross\\nmy land, you know, and--I beg your pardon--but I don\\'t care to\\nhave you do so. Besides staining your dress, you will very likely\\nbruise my tobacco.\" He had never in his life stood close to a\\nwoman who wore perfumed garments, and he felt, all at once, that\\nher fragrance was going to his brain. Delicate as it was, he\\nfound it heady, like strong drink. \"But I could walk very close\\nto\\nthe fence,\" said the girl, surprised. \"Aren\\'t you afraid of the\\npoisonous oak?\" \"Desperately. I caught it once as a child. It\\nhurt so.\" He shook his head impatiently. \"Apart from that, there\\nis no reason why you should come on my land. All the prettiest\\nwalks are on the other side--and over here the hounds are taught\\nto warn off trespassers.\" \"Am I a trespasser?\" \"You are worse,\"\\nhe replied boorishly; \"you\\'re a Fletcher.\" \"Well, you\\'re a\\nsavage,\" she retorted, angered in her turn. \"Is it simply because\\nI happen to be a Fletcher that you become a bear?\" \"Because you\\nhappen to be a Fletcher,\" he repeated, and then looked calmly and\\ncoolly at her dainty elegance.\\n\\n\"And if I were anybody else, I suppose, you would let me walk\\nalong that fence, and even be polite enough to keep the dogs from\\neating me up?\" \"If you were anybody else and didn\\'t injure my\\ntobacco--yes.\"\\n\\n\"But as it is I must keep away?\"\\n\\n\"All I ask of you is to stay on the other side.\" \"And if I\\ndon\\'t?\" she questioned, her spirit flaring up to match with his,\\n\"and if I don\\'t?\" All the natural womanhood within her responded\\nto the appeal of his superb manhood; all the fastidious\\nrefinement with which she was overlaid was alive to the rustic\\ndetails which marred the finished whole--to the streak of earth\\nacross his forehead, to the coarseness of his ill-fitting\\nclothes, to the tobacco juice staining his finger nails bright\\ngreen. On his side, the lady of his dreams had shrunken to a\\nwitch; and he shook his head again in an effort to dispel the\\nsweetness that so strangely moved him. \"In that case you will\\nmeet the hounds one day and get your dress badly torn, I fear.\"\\n\"And bitten, probably.\" \"Probably.\" \"Well, I don\\'t think it would\\nbe worth it,\" said the girl, in a quiver of indignation. \"If I\\ncan help it, I shall never set my foot on your land again.\" \"The\\nwisest thing you can do is to keep off,\" he retorted. Turning,\\nwith an angry movement, she walked rapidly to the fence, heedless\\nof the poisonous oak along the way; and Christopher, passing her\\nwith a single step, lowered the topmost rails that she might\\ncross over the more easily. \"Thank you,\" she said stiffly, as she\\nreached the other side. \"It was a pleasure,\" he responded, in the\\ntone his father might have used when in full Grecian dress at the\\nfancy ball. \"You mean it is a pleasure to assist in getting rid\\nof me?\"\\n\\n\"What I mean doesn\\'t matter,\" he answered irritably, and added,\\n\"I\\nwish to God you were anybody else!\" At this she turned and faced\\nhim squarely as he held the rails. \"But how can I help being\\nmyself?\" she demanded. \"You can\\'t, and there\\'s an end of it.\" \"Of\\nwhat?\" \"Oh, of everything--and most of all of the evening at the\\ncross-roads.\" \"You saw me then?\" she asked. \"You know I did,\" he\\nanswered, retreating into his rude simplicity. \"And you liked me\\nthen?\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" he laughed, \"why, I was fool enough to dream of you for a\\nmonth afterward.\" \"How dare you!\" she cried. \"Well, I shan\\'t do\\nit again,\" he assured her insolently. \"You can\\'t possibly dislike\\nme any more than I do you,\" she remarked, drawing back step by\\nstep. \"You\\'re a savage, and a mean one at that--but all the same,\\nI should like to know why you began to hate me.\" He laid the\\ntopmost rail along the fence and turned away. \"Ask your\\ngrandfather!\" he called back, as he passed into the tobacco\\nfield, with her fragrance still in his nostrils.\\n\\nMaria, on the other side, walked slowly homeward along the new\\nroad that had ended so abruptly. Her lip trembled, and, letting\\nher skirt drag in the dust, she put up her hand to suppress the\\nfirst hint of emotion. It angered her that he had had the power\\nto provoke her so, and for the moment the encounter seemed to\\nhave bereft her of her last shreds of womanly reserve. It was as\\nif a strong wind had blown over her, laying her bosom bare, and\\nshe flushed at the knowledge that he had heard the fluttering of\\nher breath and seen the indignant tears gather to her eyes--he a\\nboorish stranger who hated her because of her name. For the first\\ntime in her life she had run straight against an impregnable\\nprejudice--had felt her feminine charm ineffectual against a\\nstern masculine resistance. She was at the age when the\\nartificial often outweighs the real--when the superficial manner\\nwith a woman is apt to be misunderstood, and so to her\\nChristopher Blake now appeared stripped even of his physical\\ncomeliness; the interview had left her with an impression of mere\\nvulgar incivility. As she entered the house she met Fletcher\\npassing through the hall with the mail-bag in his hand, and a\\nlittle later, while she sat in a big chair by her chamber window,\\nMiss Saidie came in and laid a letter in her lap. \"It\\'s from Mr.\\nWyndham, I think, Maria. Shall I light a candle?\" \"Not yet; it is\\nso warm I like the twilight.\" \"But won\\'t you read the letter?\"\\n\"Oh, presently. There\\'s time enough.\" Miss Saidie came to the\\nwindow and leaned out to sniff the climbing roses, her shapeless\\nfigure outlined against the purple dusk spangled with fireflies.\\nHer presence irritated the girl, who stirred restlessly in her\\nchair. \"Is he coming, Maria, do you think?\"\\n\\n\"If I let him--yes.\" \"And he wants to marry you?\" The girl\\nlaughed bitterly. \"He hasn\\'t seen me in my home yet,\" she\\nanswered, \"and our vulgarity may be too much for him. He\\'s very\\nparticular, you know.\" The woman at the window flinched as if she\\nhad been struck. \"But if he loves you, Maria?\" \"Oh, he loves me\\nfor what isn\\'t me,\" she answered, \"for my \\'culture,\\' as he calls\\nit--for the gloss that has been put over me in the last ten\\nyears.\" \"Still if you care for him, dear--\" \"I don\\'t know--I\\ndon\\'t know,\" said Maria, speaking in the effort to straighten her\\ndisordered thoughts rather than for the enlightenment of Miss\\nSaidie. \"I was sure I loved him before I came home--but this\\nplace upsets me so--I hate it. It makes me feel raw, crude,\\nunlike myself. When I come back here I seem to lose all that I\\nhave learned, and to grow vulgar, like Jinnie Spade, at the\\nstore.\" \"Not like her, Maria.\" \"Well, I ought to know better, of\\ncourse, but I don\\'t believe I do--not when I\\'m here.\" \"Then why\\nnot go away? Don\\'t think of us; we can get along as we used to\\ndo.\" \"I don\\'t think of you,\" said the girl. \"I don\\'t think of\\nanybody in the world except myself--and that\\'s the awful\\npart--that\\'s the part I hate. I\\'m selfish to the core, and I know\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"But you do love Jack Wyndham?\" \"Oh, I love him to distraction!\\nLight the candle, Aunt Saidie, and let me read his letter. I can\\ntell you, word for word, what is in it before I break the seal.\\nSix months ago I went into a flutter at the sight of his\\nhandwriting. Six months before that I was madly in love with Dick\\nBright--and six months from to-day--Oh, well, I suppose I really\\nhaven\\'t much heart to know--and if I ever care for anybody it\\nmust be for Jack--that\\'s positive.\"\\n\\nStanding beside the lighted candle on the bureau, she read the\\nletter twice over, and then turning away, wrote her answer\\nkneeling beside the big chair at the window.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. The Romance that Was\\n\\nWaking in the night she said again, \"I love him to distraction,\"\\nand slipping under the dimity curtains of the bed, sought his\\nletter where she had left it on the bureau. The full light of the\\nharvest moon was in the room--a light so soft that it lay like a\\nyellow fluid upon the floor. It seemed almost as if one might\\nstoop and fill the open palms.\\n\\nShe found the letter thrown carelessly upon the pincushion, and\\nholding it to her lips, paused a moment beside the window,\\nlooking beyond the shaven lawn and the clustered oaks to where\\nthe tobacco fields lay golden beneath the moon. It was such a\\nnight as seemed granted by some kindly deity for the fulfillment\\nof lovers\\' vows, and the girl, standing beside the open window,\\ngrew suddenly sad, as one who sees a vision with the knowledge\\nthat it is not life. When presently she went back to bed it was\\nto lie sleepless until dawn, with the love letter held tightly in\\nher hands.\\n\\nThe next day a restlessness like that of fever worked in her\\nblood, and she ran from turret to basement of the roomy old\\nhouse, calling Will to come and help her find amusement.\\n\\n\"Play ball with me, Will,\" she said; \"I feel as if I were a child\\nto-day.\" \" Oh, it\\'s no fun playing with a girl,\" replied the boy;\\n\"besides, I am going fishing in the river with Zebbadee Blake; I\\nshan\\'t be back till supper,\" and shouldering his fishing-rod he\\nflung off with his can of worms. Miss Saidie was skimming big\\npans of milk in the spring-house, and Maria watched her idly for\\na time, growing suddenly impatient of the leisurely way in which\\nthe spoon travelled under the yellow cream. \"I don\\'t see how you\\ncan be so fond of it,\" she said at last. \"Lord, child, I never\\ncould abide dairy work,\" responded Miss Saidie, setting the\\nskimmed pan aside and carefully lifting another from the flat\\nstones over which a stream of water trickled. \"And yet you\\'ve\\ndone nothing else all your long life,\" wondered Maria. \"When it\\ncomes to doing a thing in this world,\" returned the little woman,\\nremoving a speck of dust from the cream with the point of the\\nspoon, \"I don\\'t ask myself whether I like it or not, but what\\'s\\nthe best way to get it done. I\\'ve spent sixty years doing things\\nI wasn\\'t fond of, and I don\\'t reckon I\\'m any the less happy for\\nhaving done \\'em well.\" \"But I should be,\" asserted Maria, and\\nthen, with her white parasol over her bared head, she started for\\na restless stroll along the old road under the great chestnuts.\\nShe had reached the abandoned ice-pond, and was picking her way\\ncarefully in the shadow of the trees, when the baying of a pack\\nof hounds in full cry broke on her ears, and with the nervous\\ntremor she had associated from childhood with the sound, she\\nstopped short in the road and waited anxiously for the hunt to\\npass. Even as she hesitated, feeling in imagination all the blind\\nterror of the pursuit, and determined to swing into a chestnut\\nbough in case of an approach, a small animal darted suddenly from\\naround the bend in the sunken road, and an instant afterward the\\nhounds in hot chase broke from the cover. For a single breath the\\ngirl, dropping her parasol, looked at the lowered branch; then as\\nthe small animal neared her her glance fell, and she saw that it\\nwas a little yellow dog, with hanging red tongue and eyes bulging\\nin terror. From side to side of the red clay road the creature\\ndoubled for a moment in its anguish, and then with a spring,\\nstraight as the flight of a homing bird, fled to the shelter of\\nMaria\\'s skirts. Quick as a heart-beat the girl\\'s personal fears\\nhad vanished, and as an almost savage instinct of battle awoke in\\nher, she stooped with a protecting movement and, picking the\\nsmall dog from the ground, held him high above her head as the\\nhounds came on. A moment before her limbs had shaken at the\\ndistant cries; now facing the immediate presence of the danger,\\nshe felt the rage of her pity flow like an infusion of strong\\nblood through her veins. Until they dashed her to the ground she\\nknew that she would stand holding the hunted creature above her\\nhead. Like a wave the pack broke instantly upon her, forcing her\\nback against the body of the chestnut, and tearing her dress, at\\nthe first blow, from her bosom to the ground. She had felt their\\nweight upon her breast, their hot breath full in her face, when,\\nin the midst of the confused noises in her ears, she heard a loud\\noath that rang out like a shot, followed by the strokes of a\\nrawhide whip on living flesh. So close came the lash that the\\ncurling end smote her cheek and left a thin flame from ear to\\nmouth. The lessening sounds became all at once like the silence;\\nand when the hounds, beaten back, slunk, whimpering, to heel, she\\nlowered her eyes until she looked straight into the face of\\nChristopher Blake. \"My God! You have pluck!\" he said, and his\\nface was like that of a dead man. Still holding the dog above her\\nhead, she lay motionless against the body of the tree. \"Drive the\\nbeasts away,\" she pleaded like a frightened child. Without a word\\nhe turned and ordered the hounds home, and they crawled\\nobediently back along the sunken road. Then he looked at her\\nagain. \"I saw them start the dog on my land,\" he said, \"and I ran\\nacross the field as soon as I could find my whip. If I hadn\\'t\\ncome up when I did they would have torn you to pieces. Not\\nanother man in the world could have brought them in. Look at your\\ndress.\" Glancing down, she followed the long slit from bosom to\\nhem. \"I hate them!\" she exclaimed fiercely. \"So it was your dog\\nthey started?\" \"Mine!\" She lowered the yellow cur, holding him\\nclose in her arms, where he nestled shivering. \"I never saw him\\nbefore, but he\\'s mine now; I saved him. I shall name him Agag,\\nbecause the bitterness of death is past.\" \"Well, rather--Look\\nhere,\" he burst out impulsively, \"you\\'ve got the staunchest pluck\\nI ever saw. I never knew a man brave enough to stand up against\\nthose hounds--and you--why, I don\\'t believe you flinched an\\neyelash, and--by George the dog wasn\\'t yours after all.\" \" As if\\nthat made a difference!\" she flashed out. \"Why, he ran to me for\\nhelp--and they might have killed me, but I\\'d never have given him\\nup.\"\\n\\n\"I believe you,\" he declared. She was conscious of a slight\\nthrill that passed quickly, leaving her white and weak. \"I feel\\ntired,\" she said, pressing hard against the tree. \"Will you be so\\ngood as to pick up my parasol?\" \"Tired!\" he exclaimed, and after\\na moment, \"Your face is hurt--did the dogs do it?\" She shook her\\nhead. \"You struck me with your whip.\" \"Is that so? I can\\'t say\\nafter this that I never lifted my hand against a woman--but harsh\\nmeasures are sometimes necessary, I reckon. Does it smart?\" She\\ntouched the place lightly. \"Oh, it\\'s no matter!\" she returned. \"I\\nsuppose I ought really to thank you for taking the trouble to\\nsave my life but I don\\'t, because, after all, the hounds are\\nyours, you know.\" \"Yes, I know; and they\\'re good hounds, too, in\\ntheir way. The dog had no business on their land.\" \"And they\\'re\\ntaught to warn off trespassers? Well, I hardly fancy their manner\\nof conveying the hint.\" \"It is sometimes useful, all the while.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, in case of a Fletcher, I presume.\"\\n\\n\"In case of a Fletcher,\" he repeated, his face darkening. \"do you\\nknow I had entirely forgotten who you were?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s time you were remembering it,\" she returned, \"for I am most\\ndecidedly a Fletcher.\"\\n\\nFor an instant he scowled upon her.\\n\\n\"Then you are most decidedly a devil,\" was his retort, as he\\nstooped to pick up her parasol from the road. \"There\\'s not much\\nleft of it,\" he remarked, handing it to her.\\n\\n\"As things go, I dare say I ought to be grateful that they spared\\nthe spokes,\" she said impatiently. \"It does seem disagreeable\\nthat I can\\'t go for a short stroll along my own road without the\\nrisk of having my clothes torn from my back. You really must keep\\nyour horrid beasts from becoming a public danger.\"\\n\\n\"They never chase anything that keeps off my farm,\" he replied\\ncoolly. \"There\\'s not so well trained a pack anywhere in the\\ncounty. No other dogs around here could have been beaten back at\\nthe death.\"\\n\\n\"I fear that doesn\\'t afford me the gratification you seem to\\nfeel--particularly as the death you allude to would have been\\nmine. I suppose I ought to be overpowered with gratitude for the\\nwhole thing, but unfortunately I\\'m not. I have had a very\\nunpleasant experience and I can\\'t help feeling that I owe it to\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re welcome to feel about it anyway you please,\" he\\nresponded, as Maria, tucking the dog under her arm, started down\\nthe road to the Hall, the tattered parasol held straight above\\nher head.\\n\\nAt the house she carried Agag to her room, where she spent the\\nafternoon in the big chair by the window. Miss Saidie, coming in\\nwith her dinner, inquired if she were sick, and then picked up\\nthe torn dress from the bed.\\n\\n\"Why, Maria, how on earth did you do it?\"\\n\\n\"Some hounds jumped on me in the road.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never! They were those dreadful Blake beasts, I know. I\\ndeclare, I\\'ll go right down and speak to Brother Bill about \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, don\\'t,\" protested the girl. \"We\\'ve had\\nquarrelling enough as it is--and, tell me, Aunt Saidie, have you\\never known what it was all about?\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie was examining the rent with an eye to a possible\\nmending, and she did not look up as she answered. \"I never\\nunderstood exactly myself, but your grandpa says they squandered\\nall their money and then got mad because they had to sell the\\nplace. That\\'s about the truth of it, I reckon.\"\\n\\n\"The Hall belonged to them once, didn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a long time ago, when they were rich. Sakes alive, Maria,\\nwhat\\'s the matter with your face?\"\\n\\n\"I struck it getting away from the hounds. It\\'s too bad, isn\\'t\\nit? And Jack coming so soon, too. Do I look very ugly?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re a perfect fright now, but I\\'ll fix you a liniment to draw\\nthe bruise away. It will be all right in a day or two. I declare,\\nif you haven\\'t gone and brought a little po\\'-folksy yellow dog\\ninto the house.\" Maria was feeding Agag with bits of chicken from\\nher plate, bending over him as he huddled against her dress.\\n\\n\"I found him in the road,\" she returned, \"and I\\'m going to keep\\nhim. I saved him from the hounds.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it seems to me you might have got a prettier one,\"\\nremarked Miss Saidie, as she went down to mix the liniment.\\n\\nIt was several mornings after this that Fletcher, coming into the\\ndining-room where Maria sat at a late breakfast, handed her a\\ntelegram, and stood waiting while she tore it open.\\n\\n\"Jim Weatherby brought it over from the crossroads,\" he said. \"It\\ngot there last night.\"\\n\\n\"I hope there\\'s nobody dead, child,\" observed Miss Saidie, from\\nthe serving-table, where she was peeling tomatoes.\\n\\n\"More likely it points to a marriage, eh, daughter?\" chuckled\\nFletcher jocosely.\\n\\nThe girl folded the paper and replaced it carefully in the\\nenvelope. \"It\\'s from Jack Wyndham,\" she said, \"and he comes this\\nevening. May I take the horses to the crossroads, grandpa?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I did have a use for them,\" responded Fletcher, in high\\ngood-nature, \"but, seeing as your young fellow doesn\\'t come every\\nday, I reckon I\\'ll let you have \\'em out.\"\\n\\nMaria flinched at his speech; and then as the clear pink spread\\nevenly in her cheeks, she spoke in her composed tones. \"I may as\\nwell tell you, grandpa, that we shall marry almost immediately,\"\\nshe said.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. Fletcher\\'s Move and Christopher\\'s Counterstroke\\n\\nNot until September, when he lounged one day with a glass of beer\\nin the little room behind Tom Spade\\'s country store, did\\nChristopher hear the news of Maria\\'s approaching marriage. It was\\nSol Peterkin who delivered it, hiccoughing in the enveloping\\nsmoke from several pipes, as he sat astride an overturned flour\\nbarrel in one corner.\\n\\n\"I jest passed a wagonload of finery on the way to the Hall,\" he\\nsaid, bulging with importance. \"It\\'s for the gal\\'s weddin\\', I\\nreckon; an\\' they do say she\\'s a regular Jezebel as far as clothes\\ngo. I met her yestiddy with her young man that is to be, an\\' the\\nway she was dressed up wasn\\'t a sight for modest eyes. Not that\\nshe beguiled me, suh, though the devil himself might have been\\nexcused for mistakin\\' her for the scarlet woman--but I\\'m past the\\ntime of life when a man wants a woman jest to set aroun\\' an\\' look\\nat. I tell you a good workin\\' pair of hands goes to my heart a\\nlong ways sooner than the blackest eyes that ever oggled.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my daughter Jinnie has been up thar sewin\\' for a month,\"\\nput in Tom Spade, a big, greasy man, who looked as if he had\\nlived on cabbage from his infancy, \"an\\' she says that sech a\\nsight of lace she never laid eyes on. Why, her very stockin\\'s\\nhave got lace let in \\'em, Jinnie says.\"\\n\\n\"Now, that\\'s what I call hardly decent,\" remarked Sol, as he spat\\nupon the dirty floor. \"Them\\'s the enticin\\' kind of women that a\\nfool hovers near an\\' a wise man fights shy of. Lace in her\\nstockin\\'s! Well, did anybody ever?\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s got a pretty ankle, you may be sho\\',\" observed Matthew\\nField, a long wisp of a man who had married too early to repent\\nit too late, \"an\\' I must say, if it kills me, that I always had a\\nsharp eye for ankles.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity you didn\\'t look as far up as the hand,\" returned Tom\\nSpade, with boisterous mirth. \"I have heard that Eliza lays hers\\non right heavy.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so, suh, that\\'s so,\" admitted Matthew, puffing smoke like\\na shifting engine, \"but that\\'s the fault of the marriage service,\\nan\\' I\\'ll stand to it at the Judgment Day yes, suh, in the very\\npresence of Providence who made it. I tell you, \\'twill I led that\\nwoman to the altar she was the meekest-mouthed creetur that ever\\nwiggled away from a kiss. Why, when I stepped on her train jest\\nas I swung her up the aisle, if you believe me, all she said was,\\n\\'I hope you didn\\'t hurt yo\\' foot\\'; an\\', bless my boots, ten\\nminutes later, comin\\' out of church, she whispered in my year,\\n\\'You white-livered, hulkin\\' hound, you, get off my veil!\\' Well,\\nwell, it\\'s sad how the ceremony can change a woman\\'s heart.\"\\n\\n\"That makes it safer always to choose a widow,\" commented Sol.\\n\"Now, they do say that this is a fine weddin\\' up at the Hall--\\nbut I have my doubts. Them lace let in stockin\\'s ain\\'t to my\\nmind.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s the rich young gentleman like?\" inquired Tom Spade, with\\ninterest. \"Jinnie says he\\'s the kind of man that makes kissin\\'\\ncome natural--but I can\\'t say that that conveys much to the\\nfather of a family.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s the sort that looks as if God Almighty had put the\\nfinishin\\' touches an\\' forgot to make the man,\" replied Sol. \"He\\'s\\ngot a mustache that you would say went to bed every night in curl\\npapers.\"\\n\\nChristopher pushed back his chair and drained his glass standing,\\nthen with a curt nod to Tom Spade he went out into the road.\\n\\nIt was the walk of a mile from the store to his house, and as he\\nwent on he fell to examining the tobacco, which appeared to ripen\\nhour by hour in the warm, moist season. There was no danger of\\nfrost as yet, and though a little of Fletcher\\'s crop had already\\nbeen cut, the others had left theirs to mature in the favourable\\nweather. From a clear emerald the landscape had changed to a\\nyellowish green, and the huge leaves had crinkled at the edges\\nlike shirred silk. Here and there pale-brown splotches on a plant\\nshowed that it had too quickly ripened, or small perforations\\nrevealed the destructive presence of a hidden tobacco worm.\\n\\nAs Christopher neared the house the hounds greeted him with a\\nsingle bay, and the cry brought Cynthia hastily out upon the\\nporch and along the little path. At the gate she met him, and\\nslipping her hand under his arm, drew him across the road to the\\nrail fence that bordered the old field. At sight of her tearless\\npallor his ever-present fear shot up, and without waiting for her\\nwords he cried out quickly: \"Is mother ill?\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" she answered, \"oh, no; but, Christopher, it is the next\\nworse thing.\"\\n\\nHe thought for a breath. \"Then she has found out?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not that either,\" she shook her head. \"Oh, Christopher,\\nit\\'s Fletcher!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s Fletcher! What in thunder have we to do with Fletcher?\"\\n\\n\"You remember the deed of trust on the place--the three hundred\\ndollars we borrowed when mother was sick. Fletcher has bought it\\nfrom Tom Spade and he means to foreclose it in a week. He has\\nadvertised the farm at the cross-roads.\"\\n\\nHe paled with anger. \"Why, I saw Tom about it three days ago,\" he\\nsaid, striking the rotten fence rail until it broke and fell\\napart; \"he told me it could run on at the same interest.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s since then that Fletcher has bought it. He meant it as a\\nsurprise, of course, to drive us out whether or no, but Sam\\nMurray came straight up to tell you.\"\\n\\nHe stood thinking hard, his eyes on the waving goldenrod in the\\nold field.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll sell the horses,\" he said at last.\\n\\n\"And starve? Besides, they wouldn\\'t bring the money.\"\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll sell the furniture--every last stick! We\\'ll sell the\\nclothes from our backs--I\\'ll sell myself into slavery before\\nFletcher shall beat me now!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve sold all we\\'ve got,\" said Cynthia; \"the old furniture is\\ntoo heavy--all that\\'s left; nobody about here wants it.\"\\n\\n\"I tell you I\\'ll find those three hundred dollars if I have to\\nsteal them. I\\'d rather go to prison than have Fletcher get the\\nplace.\"\\n\\n\"Then he\\'d leave it in the end,\" remarked Cynthia hopelessly;\\nadding after a pause, \"I\\'ve thought it all out, dear, and we must\\nsteal the money--we must steal it from mother.\"\\n\\n\"From mother!\" he echoed, touched to the quick.\\n\\n\"You know her big diamond,\" sobbed the woman, \"the one in her\\nengagement ring, that she never used to take off, even at night,\\ntill her fingers got so thin.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t!\" he protested.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no other way,\" pursued Cynthia, without noticing him.\\n\"Surely, it is better than having her turned out in her old\\nage--surely, anything is better than that. We can take the ring\\nto-night after she goes to bed, and pry the diamond from the\\nsetting; it is held only by gold claws, you know. Then we will\\nput in it the piece of purple glass from Docia\\'s wedding\\nring--the shape is the same; and she will never find it out. Oh,\\nmother! mother!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, \"returned Christopher stubbornly; \"it is like robbing\\nher, and she so blind and helpless. I cannot do it.\"\\n\\n\"Then I will,\" said Cynthia quietly, and, turning from him, she\\nwalked rapidly to the house.\\n\\nLater that night, when he had gone up to his little garret loft,\\nshe came to him with the two rings in her outstretched hand--the\\nsuperb white diamond and the common purple setting in Docia\\'s\\nbrass hoop.\\n\\n\"Lend me your knife,\" she said, kneeling beside the smoky oil\\nlamp; and without a word he drew his claspknife from his pocket,\\nopened the blade, and held the handle toward her. She took it\\nfrom him, and then knelt motionless for an instant looking at the\\ndiamond, which shone like a star in her hollowed palm. Presently\\nshe stooped and kissed it, and then taking the fine point of the\\nblade, carefully pried the gold claws back from the imprisoned\\nstone.\\n\\n\"She has worn it for fifty years,\" she said softly, seeing the\\njewel contract and give out a deeper flame to her misty eyes.\\n\\n\"It is robbery,\" he protested.\\n\\n\"It is robbery for her sake!\" she flashed out angrily.\\n\\n\"All the same, it seems bitterly cruel.\"\\n\\nWith deft fingers she removed the bit of purple glass from\\nDocia\\'s ring and inserted it between the gold claws, which she\\npressed securely down. \"To the touch there is no difference,\" she\\nsaid, closing her eyes. \"She will never know.\"\\n\\nRising from her knees, she gazed steadily at the loosened diamond\\nlying in her hand; then, wrapping it in cotton, she placed it in\\na little wooden box from a jeweller of fifty years ago. \"You must\\nget up to-morrow and take it to town,\" she went on. \"Carry it to\\nMr. Withers--he knows us. There is no other way,\" she added\\nhastily.\\n\\n\"There is no other way, I know,\" he repeated, as he held out his\\nhand.\\n\\n\"And you\\'ll be back after sundown.\"\\n\\n\"Not until night. I shall walk over from the cross-roads.\"\\n\\nFor a time they were both silent, and he, walking to the narrow\\nwindow, looked out into the moist darkness. The smell of the oil\\nlamp oppressed the atmosphere inside, and the damp wind in his\\nface revived in a measure his lowered spirits. He seemed suddenly\\nable to cope with life--and with Fletcher.\\n\\nFar away there was a faint glimmer among the trees, now shining\\nclear, now almost lost in mist, and he knew it to be a lighted\\nwindow at Blake Hall. The thought of Maria\\'s lace stockings came\\nto him all at once, and he was seized with a rage that was\\nludicrously large for so small a cause. Confused questions\\nwhirled in his brain, struggling for recognition: \"I am here and\\nshe is there, and what is the meaning of it all? I know in spite\\nof everything I might have loved her, and yet I know still better\\nthat it is not love, but hate I now feel. What is the difference,\\nafter all? And why this eternal bother of possibilities?\" He\\nturned presently and spoke:\\n\\n\"And you got this without her suspecting it?\"\\n\\n\"She was sleeping like a child, and Lila was in the little bed in\\nher chamber. Often she is restless, disturbed by her dreams, but\\nto-night she lies very quiet, and she smiled once as if she were\\nso happy.\"\\n\\n\"And to-morrow she will wear the ring with its setting of purple\\nglass.\"\\n\\n\"She will never know--see, it fits perfectly. I have fastened it\\ncarefully. After all, what does it matter to her--the ring is\\nstill the same, and the value of it was for her in the\\nassociation.\" Again he looked out of the window, and the distant\\nglimmer gathered radiance and shone brightly among the trees. \"I\\nam here and she is there, and what is the meaning of it all?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. A Gallant Deed that Leads to Evil\\n\\nTwo days later Christopher met Fletcher in the little room behind\\nthe store and paid down the three hundred dollars in the presence\\nof Sam Murray. Several loungers, who had been seasoning their\\ndrinks with leisurely stories, hastily drained their glasses and\\nwithdrew at Fletcher\\'s entrance, and when the three men came\\ntogether to settle the affair of the mortgage they were alone in\\nthe presence of the tobacco-stained walls, the square pine table\\nwith its dirty glasses, and the bills of notice posted beside the\\ndoor. Among them Christopher had seen the public advertisement of\\nhis farm--a rambling statement in large letters, signifying that\\nthe place would be sold for debt on Monday, the twenty-fifth of\\nSeptember, at twelve o\\'clock. \"I want the money right flat down.\\nAre you sure you\\'ve got it?\" were Fletcher\\'s first words after\\nhis start of angry surprise. For answer Christopher drew the roll\\nof bills from his pocket and counted them out upon the table.\\n\"Here it is,\" he said, \"and I am done with you for good and\\nall--with you and your rascally cheating ways,\" \"Come, come,\\nlet\\'s go easy,\" warned Sam Murray, a fat, well-to-do farmer, who\\nwas accustomed to act the part of a lawyer in small transactions.\\nFletcher flushed purple and threw off his rage in a sneering\\nguffaw. \"Now that sounds well from him, doesn\\'t it?\" he inquired\\n\"when everybody knows he hasn\\'t a beggarly stitch on earth but\\nthat strip of land he thinks so much of.\" \"And whose fault is\\nthat, Bill Fletcher?\" demanded the young man, throwing the last\\nnote down. \"Oh, well, I don\\'t bear you any grudge,\" responded\\nFletcher, with an abrupt assumption of goodnatured tolerance;\\n\"and to show I\\'m a well-meaning man in spite of abuse, I\\'ll let\\nthe debt run on two years longer at the same interest if you\\nchoose.\"\\n\\nChristopher laughed shortly. \"That\\'s all right, Sam,\" he said,\\nwithout replying directly to the offer. \"I owe him too much\\nalready to hope to pay it back in a single lifetime.\" \"Well,\\nyou\\'re a cantankerous, hard-headed fool, that\\'s all I\\'ve got to\\nsay,\" burst out Fletcher, swallowing hard, and the sooner you get\\nto the poorhouse along your own road the better it\\'ll be for the\\nrest of us.\" \"You may be sure I\\'ll take care not to go along\\nyours. I\\'ll have honest men about me, at any rate.\" \"Then it\\'s\\nmore than you\\'ve got a right to expect.\"\\n\\nChristopher grew pale to the lips. \"What do you mean, you\\nscoundrel?\" he cried, taking a single step forward. \"Come, come,\\nlet\\'s go easy,\" said Sam Murray persuasively, rising from his\\nchair at the table. \"Now that this little business is all settled\\nthere\\'s no need for another word. I haven\\'t much opinion of words\\nmyself, anyhow. They\\'re apt to set fire to a dry tongue, that\\'s\\nwhat I say.\" \"What do you mean?\" repeated Christopher, without\\nswerving from his steady gaze. Tom Spade glanced in at the open\\ndoor, and, catching Fletcher\\'s eye, hurriedly retreated. A small\\nboy with a greasy face came in and gathered up the glasses with a\\nclanking noise. \"What do you mean, you coward?\" demanded\\nChristopher for the third time. He had not moved an inch from the\\nposition he had first assumed, but the circle about his mouth\\nshowed blue against the sunburn on his face. Fletcher raised his\\nhand and spoke suddenly with a snort. \"Oh, you needn\\'t kick so\\nabout swallowing it,\" he said. \"Everybody knows that your\\ngrandfather never paid a debt he owed, and your father was mighty\\nlittle better. He was only saved from becoming a thief by being a\\ndrunkard.\" He choked over the last word, for Christopher, with an\\neasy, almost leisurely movement, had struck him full in the\\nmouth. The young man\\'s arm was raised again, but before it fell\\nSam Murray caught it back. \"I say, Tom, there\\'s the devil to pay\\nhere!\" he shouted, and Tom Spade rushed hurriedly through the\\ndoorway. \"Now, now, that\\'ll never do, Mr. Christopher,\" he\\nreasoned, with a deference he would never have wasted upon\\nFletcher. \"Why, he\\'s old enough to be yo\\' pa twice over.\"\\n\\nA white fleck was on Fletcher\\'s beard, and as he wiped it away he\\nspoke huskily. \"It\\'s a clear case of assault and I\\'ll have the\\nlaw on him,\" he said. \"Sam Murray, you saw him hit me square in\\nthe face.\"\\n\\n\"Bless your life, I wasn\\'t looking, suh,\" responded Sam\\npleasantly. \"I miss a lot in this life by always happening to\\nlook the other way.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have the law on you,\" cried Fletcher again, shaking back\\nhis heavy eyebrows.\\n\\n\"You\\'re welcome to have every skulking hound in the county on\\nme,\" Christopher replied, loosening Sam Murray\\'s restraining\\ngrasp. \"If I can settle you I reckon I can settle them; but the\\nday you open your lying mouth to me again I\\'ll shoot you down as\\nI would a mad dog--and wash my hands clean afterward!\"\\n\\nHe looked round for his harvest hat, picked it up from the floor\\nwhere it had fallen, and walked slowly out of the room.\\n\\nIn the broad noon outside he staggered an instant, dazzled by the\\nglare.\\n\\n\"Had a drop too much, ain\\'t you, Mr. Christopher?\" a voice\\ninquired at his side, and, looking down, he saw Sol Peterkin\\nsitting on a big wooden box just outside the store.\\n\\n\"Not too much to mind my own business,\" was his curt reply.\\n\\n\"Oh, no harm\\'s meant, suh, an\\' I hope none\\'s taken,\" responded\\nthe little man good-naturedly. \"I saw you walk kinder crooked,\\nthat was all, an\\'it came to me that you might be needin\\' an arm\\ntoward home. Young gentlemen will be gentlemen, that\\'s the truth,\\nsuh, an\\' in my day I reckon I\\'ve steadied the legs of mo\\' young\\nbeaux than you could count on your ten fingers. Good Lord, when\\nit comes to thinkin\\' of those Christmas Eve frolics that we had\\nbefo\\' the war! Why, they use to say that you couldn\\'t get to the\\nHall unless you swam your way through apple toddy. Jest to think!\\nan\\' here I\\'ve been settin\\' an\\' countin\\' the bundles goin\\' up\\nthar now--\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m looking for a box, Tom,\" said a clear voice at Christopher\\'s\\nback, \"a big paper hat-box that ought to have come by express--\"\\n\\nHe turned quickly and saw Maria Fletcher in a little cart in the\\nroad, with a strange young man holding the reins. As Christopher\\nswung round, she nodded pleasantly, but with a cool stare he\\npassed down the steps and out into the road, carrying with him a\\ndistasteful impression of the strange young man. Yet from that\\nfirst hurried glimpse he had brought away only the picture of a\\nbrown mustache.\\n\\n\"By George, I\\'d like to see that fellow in the prize ring,\" he\\nheard the stranger remark as he went by. \"Do they have knock-outs\\naround here, I wonder?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I dare say he\\'d oblige you with one if you took the trouble\\nto tread on his preserves,\" was the girl\\'s laughing rejoinder.\\n\\nA massive repulsion swept over Christopher, pervading his entire\\nbody--repulsion that was but a recoil from his exhausted rage. In\\nthis new emotion there were both weariness and self-pity, and to\\nhis mental vision there showed clearly, with an impersonal\\ndetachment, his own figure in relation to the scenes among which\\nhe moved. \"That is I yonder,\" he might have said had he been able\\nto disentangle thought from sensation, \"plodding along there\\nthrough the red mud in the road. Look at the coarse clothes,\\nsmelling of axle-grease, the hands knotted by toil and stained\\nwith tobacco juice, the face soiled with sweat and clay. That is\\nI, who was born with the love of ease and the weakness to\\ntemptation in my blood, with the love, too, of delicate food, of\\nrare wines, and of beautiful women. Once I craved these things;\\nnow the thought of them troubles me no longer, for I work in the\\nsun all day and go home to enjoy my coarse food. Is it because I\\nhave been broken to this life as a young horse is broken to the\\nplough, or have all the desires I have known been swallowed up in\\na single hatred--a hatred as jealous and as strong as love?\"\\n\\nIt was his nightly habit, lying upon his narrow bed in the little\\nloft, to yield some moments before sleeping to his idle dreams of\\nvengeance--to plan exquisite punishments and impossible\\nretaliations. In imagination he had so often seen Fletcher drop\\ndead before him, had so often struck the man down with his own\\nhand, that there were hours when he almost believed the deed to\\nhave been done--when something like madness gripped him, and his\\nhallucinations took the shape and colour of life itself. At such\\ntimes he was conscious of the exhilaration that comes in the\\ninstants of swift action, when events move quickly, and one rises\\nbeyond the ordinary level of experience. When the real moment\\ncame--the supreme chance--he wondered if he would meet it as\\ntriumphantly as he met his dreams? Now, plodding along the rocky\\nroad, he went over again all the old schemes for the great\\nrevenge.\\n\\nThe small cart whirled past him, scattering dried mud drops in\\nhis face, and he caught the sound of bright girlish laughter.\\nLooking after it, he saw the flutter of cherry-coloured ribbons\\ncoiling outward in the wind, and he remembered, watching the gay\\nstreamers, that the only woman he had ever kissed was eating\\ncherries at the moment. Trivial as the recollection was, it\\nstarted other associations, and he followed the escaping memory\\nof that boyish romance, blithe and short-lived, which was killed\\nat last by a single yielded kiss. At sixteen it had seemed to him\\nthat when he caught the girl of the cherries in his arms he\\nshould hold veritable happiness; and yet afterward there was only\\na great heaviness and something of the repulsion that he felt\\nto-day. Happiness was not to be found on a woman\\'s lips he had\\nlearned this in his boyhood; and then even as the knowledge\\nreturned to him he found himself savagely regretting that he had\\nnot kissed Maria Fletcher the day he found her on his land--a\\nkiss of anger, not of love, which she would have loathed all her\\nlife--and have remembered! To have her utterly forget him--pass\\non serenely into her marriage, hardly remembering that he hated\\nher--this was the bitterest thing he had to face; but with the\\nbrutal wish, he softened in recalling the tremor of her lip as\\nshe turned away--the indignant quiver of her eyelashes. Again\\ncame the thought: \"I know in spite of everything I might have\\nloved her, and yet I know still better that it is not love, but\\nhate I now feel.\" Her fragrance, floating in the sunshine, filled\\nhis nostrils, and involuntarily he glanced over his shoulder,\\nhalf expecting to find a dropped handkerchief in the road. None\\nwas there--only a scattered swarm of butterflies drifting like\\nyellow rose-leaves on the wind.\\n\\nUpon reaching the house he found that his mother had asked for\\nhim, and running hastily up to change his clothes, he came down\\nand bent over the upright Elizabethan chair. \"I have been\\nworrying a good deal about you, my son,\" she said, with a\\nsprightly gesture in which the piece of purple glass struck the\\ndominant note. \"Are you quite sure that you are feeling perfectly\\nwell? No palpitations of the heart when you go upstairs? and no\\nparticular heaviness after meals? I dreamed about you all night\\nlong, and though there\\'s not a woman in the world freer from\\nsuperstition, I can\\'t help feeling uneasy.\" Taking her hand, he\\ngently caressed the slender fingers. \"Why, I\\'m a regular ox,\\nmother,\" he returned, laughing, --my muscle is like iron, and I\\nassure you I\\'m ready for my meals day or night. There\\'s no use\\nworrying about me, so you\\'d as well give it up.\" \"I can\\'t\\nunderstand it, I really can\\'t,\" protested Mrs. Blake, still\\nunconvinced. \"I am an old woman, you know, and I am anxious to\\nhave you settled in life before I die--but there seems to be a\\nmost extraordinary humour in the family with regard to marriage.\\nI\\'m sure your poor father would turn in his grave at the very\\nidea of his having no grand-children to come after him.\" \"Well,\\nthere\\'s time yet, mother; give us breathing space.\" \"There\\'s not\\ntime in my day, Christopher, for I am very old, and half dead as\\nit is--but it does seem hard that I am never to be present at the\\nmarriage of a child. As for Cynthia, she is out of the question,\\nof course, which is a great pity. I have very little patience\\nwith an unmarried woman--no, not if she were Queen Elizabeth\\nherself though I do know that they are sometimes found very\\nuseful in the dairy or the spinning-room. As for an old bachelor,\\nI have never seen the spot on earth--and I\\'ve lived to a great\\nage--where he wasn\\'t an encumbrance. They really ought to be\\ntaught some useful occupation, such as skimming milk or carding\\nwool.\" \"I hardly think either of those pursuits would be to my\\ntaste,\" protested Christopher, \"but I give you leave to try your\\nhand on Uncle Tucker.\" \"Tucker has been a hero, my son,\" rejoined\\nthe old lady in a stately voice, \"and the privilege of having\\nonce been a hero is that nobody expects you to exert yourself\\nagain. A man who has taken the enemy\\'s guns single-handed, or\\nfigured prominently in a society scandal, is comfortably settled\\nin his position and may slouch pleasantly for the remainder of\\nhis life. But for an ordinary gentleman it is quite different,\\nand as we are not likely to have another war, you really ought to\\nmarry. You are preparing to go through life too peacefully, my\\nson.\" \"Good Lord!\" exclaimed Christopher, \"are you hankering\\nafter squabbles? Well, you shan\\'t drag me into them, at any cost.\\nThere\\'s Uncle Tucker to your hand, as I said before.\" \"I\\'m sure\\nTucker might have married several times had he cared about it,\"\\nreplied Mrs. Blake reprovingly. \"Miss Matoaca Bolling always had\\na sentiment for him, I am certain, and even after his misfortune\\nshe went so far as to present him with a most elaborate slipper\\nof red velvet ornamented with steel beads. I remember well her\\nconsulting me as to whether it would be better to seem\\nunsympathetic and give him two or to appear indelicate and offer\\nhim one. I suggested that she should make both for the same\\nfoot, which, I believe, she finally decided to do.\" \"Well,\\nwell, this is all very interesting, mother,\" said Christopher,\\nrising from his seat, \"but I\\'ve promised old Jacob Weatherby to\\npass my word on his tobacco. On the way down, however, I\\'ll cast\\nmy eyes about for a wife.\" \"Between here and the Weatherbys\\'\\nfarm? Why, Christopher!\" \"That\\'s all right, but unless you expect\\nme to pick up one on the roadside I don\\'t see how we\\'ll manage.\\nI\\'ll do anything to oblige you, you know, even marry, if you\\'ll\\nfind me a good, sensible woman.\" The old lady\\'s eyelids dropped\\nover her piercing black eyes, which seemed always to regard some\\nfar-off, ecstatic vision. Three small furrows ran straight up and\\ndown her forehead, and she lifted one delicate white hand to rub\\nthem out. \"I don\\'t like joking on so serious a subject, my son,\"\\nshe said. \"I\\'m sure Providence expects every man to do his duty,\\nand to remain unmarried seems like putting one\\'s personal\\ninclination before the intentions of the Creator. Your\\ngrandfather Corbin used to say he had so high an opinion of\\nmarriage that if his fourth wife --and she was very sickly--were\\nto die at once, he\\'d marry his fifth within the year. I remember\\nthat Bishop Deane remarked it was one of the most beautiful\\ntributes ever paid the marriage state--especially as it was no\\nidle boast, for, as it happened, his wife died shortly afterward,\\nand he married Miss Polly Blair before six months were up.\" \"What\\na precious old fool he was!\" laughed the young man, as he reached\\nthe door, passing out with a horrified \"What, Christopher! Your\\nown grandfather?\" ringing in his ears. In the yard he found\\nCynthia drawing water at the well, and he took the heavy bucket\\nfrom her and carried it into the kitchen. \"You\\'d better change\\nyour clothes,\" she remarked, eyeing him narrowly, \"if you\\'re\\ngoing\\nback to the field.\" \"But I\\'m not going back; the axe handle has\\nbroken again and I\\'ll have to borrow Jim Weatherby\\'s. There\\'s no\\nuse trying to mend that old handle any more. It\\'ll have to lie\\nover till after tobacco cutting, when I can make a new one.\" \"Oh,\\nyou might as well keep Jim\\'s altogether,\" returned Cynthia\\nirritably, loath to receive favours from her neighbours. \"The\\nfirst thing we know he will be running this entire place.\" \"I\\nreckon he\\'d make a much better job of it,\" replied Christopher,\\nas he swung out into the road. On the whitewashed porch of the\\nWeatherbys\\' house he found old Jacob--a hale, clearly old man\\nwith cheeks like frosted winter apples--gazing thoughtfully over\\nhis fine field of tobacco, which had grown almost to his\\nthreshold. \"The weather\\'s going to have a big drop to-night,\" he\\nsaid reflectively; \"I smell it on the wind. Lord! Lord! I reckon\\nI\\'d better begin on that thar tobaccy about sunup--and yet\\nanother day or so of sun and September dew would sweeten it\\nconsider\\'ble. How about yours, Mr. Christopher?\" \"I\\'ll cut my\\nripest plants to-morrow,\" answered Christopher, sniffing the air.\\n\"A big drop\\'s coming, sure enough, but I don\\'t scent frost as\\nyet--the pines don\\'t smell that way.\" They discussed the tobacco\\nfor a time--the rosy, genial old man, whom age had mellowed\\nwithout souring--listening with a touching deference to his\\nvisitor\\'s casual words; and when at last Christopher, with the\\naxe on his shoulder, started leisurely homeward, \"the drop\" was\\nalready beginning, and the wind blew cool and crisp across the\\nmisty fields, beyond which a round, red sun was slowly setting.\\nLevel, vast and dark, the tobacco swept clear to the horizon.\\nBetween Weatherby\\'s and the little store there was an abrupt bend\\nin the road, where it shot aside from a steep descent in the\\nground; and Christopher had reached this point when he saw\\nsuddenly ahead of him a farm wagon driven forward at a reckless\\npace. As it neared him he heard the wheels thunder on the rocky\\nbed of the road, and saw that the driver\\'s seat was vacant, the\\nman evidently having been thrown some distance back. The\\nhorses--a young pair he had never seen before--held the bits in\\ntheir mouths; and it was with a hopelessness of checking their\\nterrible speed that he stepped out of the road to give them room.\\nThe next instant he saw that they were making straight for the\\ndeclivity from which the road shot back, seeing in the same\\nbreath that the driver of the wagon, not falling clear, had\\nentangled himself in the long reins and was being dragged rapidly\\nbeneath the wheels. Tossing his axe aside, he sprang instantly at\\nthe horses\\' heads, hanging with his whole powerful weight upon\\ntheir mouths. Life or death was nothing to him at the moment, and\\nhe seemed to have only an impersonal interest in the multiplied\\nsensations. What followed was a sense of incalculable swiftness,\\na near glimpse of blue sky, the falling of stars around him in\\nthe road, and after these things a great darkness.\\n\\nWhen he came to himself he was lying in a patch of short grass,\\nwith a little knot of men about him, among whom he recognised Jim\\nWeatherby. \"I brought them in, didn\\'t I?\" he asked, struggling\\nup; and then he saw that his coat sleeves were rent from the\\narmholes, leaving his arms bare beneath his torn blue shirt.\\nCynthia\\'s warning returned to him, and he laughed shortly. \"Well,\\nI reckon you could bring the devil in if you put all your grip on\\nhim,\" was Jim\\'s reply; \"as it is, you\\'re pretty sore, ain\\'t you?\"\\n\"Oh, rather, but I wish I hadn\\'t spoiled my coat.\" He was still\\nthinking of Cynthia. \"God alive, man, it\\'s a mercy you didn\\'t\\nspoil your life. Why, another second and the horses would have\\nbeen over that bank yonder, with you and young Fletcher under the\\nwagon.\"\\n\\nChristopher rose slowly from the ground and stood erect.\\n\\n\"With me--and who under the wagon?--and who?\" he asked in a\\nthroaty voice.\\n\\nJim Weatherby whistled. \"Why, to think you didn\\'t know all\\nalong!\" he exclaimed. \"It was Fletcher\\'s boy; he made Zebbadee\\nlet him take the reins. Fletcher saw it all and he was clean mad\\nwhen he got here--it took three men to hold him. He thinks more\\nof that boy than he does of his own soul. What\\'s the matter, man,\\nare you hurt?\"\\n\\nChristopher had gone dead white, and the blue circle came out\\nslowly around his mouth. \"And I saved him!\" he gasped. \"I saved\\nhim! Isn\\'t there some mistake? Maybe he\\'s dead anyway!\"\\n\\n\"Bless you, no,\" responded Jim, a trifle disconcerted. \"The\\ndoctor\\'s here and he says it\\'s a case of a broken leg instead of\\na broken neck, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\nLooking about him, Christopher saw that there was another group\\nof men at a little distance, gathered around something that lay\\nstill and straight on the grass. The sound of a hoarse groan\\nreached him suddenly--an inarticulate cry of distress--and he\\nfelt with a savage joy that it was from Fletcher. He looked down,\\ndrawing together his tattered sleeves. For a time he was silent,\\nand when he spoke it was with a sneering laugh.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been a fool, that\\'s all,\" was what he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. The Glimpse of a Bride\\n\\nThe next morning he awoke with stiffened limbs and confusion in\\nhis head, and for a time he lay idly looking at his little\\nwindow-panes, beyond which the dawn hung like a curtain. Then, as\\na long finger of sunlight pointed through the glass, he rose with\\nan effort and, dressing himself hastily, went downstairs to\\nbreakfast. Here he found that Zebbadee Blake, who had promised to\\nhelp him cut his crop, had not yet appeared, owing probably to\\nthe excitement of Fletcher\\'s runaway. The man\\'s absence annoyed\\nhim at first; and then, as the day broke clear and cold, he\\nsuccumbed to his ever present fear of frost and, taking his\\npruning-knife from the kitchen mantelpiece, went out alone to\\nbegin work on his ripest plants.\\n\\nThe sun had already tempered the morning chill in the air, and\\nthe slanting beams stretched over the tobacco, which, as the dew\\ndried, showed a vivid green but faintly tinged with yellow--a\\ncolour that even in the sparkling sunlight appeared always\\nslightly shadowed. To attempt alone the cutting of his crop,\\nsmall as it was, seemed, with his stiffened limbs, a particularly\\ntrying task, and for a moment he stood gazing wearily across the\\nfield. Presently, with a deliberate movement as if he were\\nstooping to shoulder a fresh burden, he slit the first ripe stalk\\nfrom its flaunting top to within a hand\\'s-breadth of the ground;\\nthen, cutting it half through near the roots, he let it fall to\\none side, where it hung, slowly wilting, on the earth. Gradually,\\nas he applied himself to the work, the old zest of healthful\\nlabour returned to him, and he passed buoyantly through the\\nnarrow aisle, leaving a devastated furrow on either side. It was\\na cheerful picture he presented, when Tucker, dragging himself\\nheavily from the house, came to the ragged edge of the field and\\nsat down on an old moss-grown stump. \"Where\\'s Zebbadee,\\nChristopher?\" \" He didn\\'t turn up. It was that affair of the\\naccident, probably. Fletcher berated him, I reckon.\" \"So you\\'ve\\ngot to cut it all yourself. Well, it\\'s a first-rate crop--the\\nvery primings ought to be as good as some top leaves.\" \"The\\ncrop\\'s\\nall right,\" responded Christopher, as his knife passed with a\\nripping noise down the juicy stalk. \"You know I made a fool of\\nmyself yesterday, Uncle Tucker,\" he said suddenly, drawing back\\nwhen the plant fell slowly across the furrow, \"and I\\'m so stiff\\nin the joints this morning I can hardly move. I met one of\\nFletcher\\'s farm wagons running away, with his boy dragged by the\\nreins, and--I stopped it.\" Tucker turned his mild blue eyes upon\\nhim. Since the news of Appomattox nothing had surprised him, and\\nhe was not surprised now--he was merely interested. \"You couldn\\'t\\nhave helped it, I suspect,\" he remarked.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know whose it was, you see,\" answered Christopher; \"the\\nhorses were new.\" \"You\\'d have done it anyway, I reckon. At such\\nmoments it\\'s a man\\'s mettle that counts, you know, and not his\\nemotions. You might have hated Fletcher ten times worse, but\\nyou\\'d have risked your life to stop the horses all the same--\\nbecause, after all, what a man is is something different from how\\nhe feels about things. It\\'s in your blood to dare everything\\nwhenever a chance offers, as it was in your father\\'s before you.\\nWhy, I\\'ve seen him stop on the way to a ball, pull off his coat,\\nand go up a burning ladder to save a woman\\'s pet canary, and\\nthen, when the crowd hurrahed him, I\\'ve laughed because I knew he\\ndeserved nothing of the kind. With him it wasn\\'t courage so much\\nas his inborn love of violent action--it cleared his head, he\\nused to say.\" Christopher stopped cutting, straightened himself,\\nand held his knife loosely in his hand. \"That\\'s about it, I\\nreckon,\" he returned. \"I know I\\'m not a bit of a hero--if I\\'d\\nbeen in your place I\\'d have shown up long ago for a skulking\\ncoward--but it\\'s the excitement of the moment that I like. Why,\\nthere\\'s nothing in life I\\'d enjoy so much as knocking Fletcher\\ndown--it\\'s one of the things I look forward to that makes it all\\nworth while.\" Tucker laughed softly. It was a peculiarity of his\\nnever to disapprove. That\\'s a good savage instinct,\" he said,\\nwith a humorous tremor of his nostrils, \"and it\\'s a saying of\\nmine, you know, that a man is never really--civilised until he\\nhas turned fifty. We\\'re all born mighty near to the wolf and\\nmighty far from the dog, and it takes a good many years to coax\\nthe wild beast to lie quiet by the fireside. It\\'s the struggle\\nthat the Lord wants, I reckon; and anyhow, He makes it easier for\\nus as the years go on. When a man gets along past his fiftieth\\nyear, he begins to understand that there are few things worth\\nbothering about, and the sins of his fellow mortals are not among\\n\\'em.\" \" Bless my soul!\" exclaimed Christopher in disgust, rapping\\nhis palm smartly with the flat blade of his knife. \"Do you mean\\nto tell me you\\'ve actually gone and forgiven Bill Fletcher?\"\\n\"Well, I wouldn\\'t go so far as to water the grass on his grave,\\n\"answered Tucker, still smiling, \"but I\\'ve not the slightest\\nobjection to his eating, sleeping, and moving on the surface of\\nthe earth. There\\'s room enough for us both, even in this little\\ncounty, and so long as he keeps out of my sight, as far as I am\\nconcerned he absolutely doesn\\'t exist. I never think of him\\nexcept when you happen to call his name. If a man steals my\\nmoney, that\\'s his affair. I can\\'t afford to let him steal my\\npeace of mind as well.\" With a groan Christopher went back to his\\nwork. \"It may be sense you\\'re talking,\" he observed, \"but it\\nsounds to me like pure craziness. It\\'s just as well, either way,\\nI reckon, that I\\'m not in your place and you in mine--for if that\\nwere so Fletcher would most likely go scot free.\" Tucker rose\\nunsteadily from the stump. \"Why, if we stood in each other\\'s\\nboots, \"he said, with a gentle chuckle, \"or, to be exact, if I\\nstood in your two boots and you in my one, as sure as fate, you\\'d\\nbe thinking my way and I yours. Well, I wish I could help you,\\nbut as I can\\'t I\\'ll be moving slowly back.\"\\n\\nHe shuffled off on his crutches, painfully swinging himself a\\nstep at a time, and Christopher, after a moment\\'s puzzled stare\\nat his pathetic figure, returned diligently to his work.\\n\\nHis passage along the green aisle was very slow, and when at last\\nhe reached the extreme end by the little beaten path and felled\\nthe last stalk on his left side he straightened himself for a\\nmoment\\'s rest, and stood, bareheaded, gazing over the broad\\nfield, which looked as if a windstorm had blown in an even line\\nalong the edge, scattering the outside plants upon the ground.\\nThe thought of his work engrossed him at the instant, and it was\\nwith something of a start that he became conscious presently of\\nMaria Fletcher\\'s voice at his back. Wheeling about dizzily, he\\nfound her leaning on the old rail fence, regarding him with\\nshining eyes in which the tears seemed hardly dried.\\n\\n\"I have just left Will,\" she said; \"the doctor has set his leg\\nand he is sleeping. It was my last chance--I am going away\\nto-morrow--and I wanted to tell you--I wanted so to tell you how\\ngrateful we feel.\"\\n\\nThe knife dropped from his hand, and he came slowly along the\\nlittle path to the fence.\\n\\n\"I fear you\\'ve got an entirely wrong idea about me, \"he answered.\\n\"It was nothing in the world to make a fuss over--and I swear to\\nyou if it were the last word I ever spoke--I did not know it was\\nyour brother.\"\\n\\n\"As if that mattered!\" she exclaimed, and he remembered vaguely\\nthat he had heard her use the words before. \"You risked your life\\nto save his life, we know that. Grandpa saw it all--and the\\nhorses dragged you, too. You would have been killed if the others\\nhadn\\'t run up when they did. And you tell me--as if that made it\\nany the less brave that you didn\\'t know it was Will.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t, \"he repeated stubbornly. \"I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he does, \" she responded, smiling; \"and he wants to thank\\nyou himself when he is well enough.\"\\n\\n\"If you wish to do me a kindness, for heaven\\'s sake tell him not\\nto,\" he said irritably. \"I hate all such foolishness it makes me\\nout a hypocrite!\"\\n\\n\"I knew you\\'d hate it; I told them so,\" tranquilly responded the\\ngirl. \"Aunt Saidie wanted to rush right over last night, but I\\nwouldn\\'t let her. All brave men dislike to have a fuss made over\\nthem, I know.\"\\n\\n\"Good Lord!\" ejaculated Christopher, and stopped short,\\nimpatiently desisting before the admiration illumining her eyes.\\n>From her former disdain he had evidently risen to a height in\\nher regard that was romantic in its ardour. It was in vain that\\nhe told himself he cared for one emotion as little as for the\\nother--in spite of his words, the innocent fervour in her face\\nswept over the barrier of his sullen pride.\\n\\n\"So you are going away to-morrow, \"he said at last; \"and for\\ngood?\"\\n\\n\"For good, yes. I go abroad very unexpectedly for perhaps five\\nyears. My things aren\\'t half ready, but business is of more\\nimportance than a woman\\'s clothes.\"\\n\\n\"Will you be alone?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no.\"\\n\\n\"Who goes with you?\" he insisted bluntly.\\n\\nAs she reddened, he watched the colour spread slowly to her\\nthroat and ear.\\n\\n\"I am to be married, you know,\" she answered, with her accustomed\\ncomposure of tone.\\n\\nHis lack of gallantry was churlish.\\n\\n\"To that dummy with the brown mustache?\" he inquired.\\n\\nA little hysterical laugh broke from her, and she made a hopeless\\ngesture of reproof. \"Your manners are really elementary,\" she\\nremarked, adding immediately: \"I assure you he isn\\'t in the least\\na dummy--he is considered a most delightful talker.\"\\n\\nHe swept the jest impatiently aside.\\n\\n\"Why do you do it?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\"Do what?\"\\n\\n\"You know what I mean. Why do you marry him?\"\\n\\nAgain she bit back a laugh. It was all very primitive, very\\nsavage, she told herself; it was, above all, different from any\\nof the life that she had known, and yet, in a mysterious way, it\\nwas familiar, as if the unrestrained emotion in his voice stirred\\nsome racial memory within her brain.\\n\\n\"Why do I marry him?\" She drew a step away, looking at sky and\\nfield. \"Why do I marry him?\" She hesitated slightly, \"Oh, for\\nmany reasons, and all good ones--but most of all because I love\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"You do not love him.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, but I do.\"\\n\\nFor the first time in her life, as her eyes swept over the\\nlandscape, she was conscious of a peculiar charm in the wildness\\nof the country, in the absence of all civilising influences--in\\nthe open sky, the red road, the luxuriant tobacco, the coarse\\nsprays of yarrow blooming against the fence; in the homely tasks,\\ndrawing one close to the soil, and the harvesting of the ripened\\ncrops, the milking of the mild-eyed cows, and in the long still\\ndays, followed by the long still nights.\\n\\nTheir eyes met, and for a time both were silent. She felt again\\nthe old vague trouble at his presence, the appeal of the rustic\\ntradition, the rustic temperament; of all the multiplied\\ninheritances of the centuries, which her education had not\\nutterly extinguished.\\n\\n\"Well, I hope you\\'ll live to regret it,\" he said suddenly, with\\nbitter passion.\\n\\nThe words startled her, and she caught her breath with a tremor.\\n\\n\"What an awful wish!\" she exclaimed lightly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s an honest one.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure I shouldn\\'t prefer a little polite lying.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t get it from me. I hope you\\'ll live to regret it. Why\\nshouldn\\'t I?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you might at least be decently human. If you hadn\\'t been so\\nbrave yesterday, I might almost think you a savage to-day.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t do that on purpose, I told you,\" he returned angrily.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t make me believe that--it\\'s no use trying.\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t try--though it\\'s the gospel truth--and you\\'ll find it\\nout some day.\"\\n\\n\"When?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, when the time comes, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"You speak in riddles,\" she said, \"and I always hated guessing.\"\\nThen she held out her hand with a pleasant, conventional smile.\\n\"I am grateful to you in spite of everything,\" she said; \"and now\\ngood-by.\"\\n\\nHis arms hung at his side. \"No, I won\\'t shake hands,\" he\\nanswered. \"What\\'s the use?\"\\n\\n\"As you please--only, it\\'s the usual thing at parting.\"\\n\\n\"All the same, I won\\'t do it,\" he said stubbornly. \"My hands are\\nnot clean.\" He held them out, soiled with earth and the stains\\nfrom the tobacco.\\n\\nFor an instant her eyes dwelt upon him very kindly.\\n\\n\"Oh, I shan\\'t mind the traces of honest toil,\" she said; but as\\nhe still hung back, she gave a friendly nod and went quickly\\nhomeward along the road. As her figure vanished among the trees,\\na great bitterness oppressed him, and, picking up his knife, he\\nwent back doggedly to his work.\\n\\nIn the kitchen, when he returned to dinner some hours later, he\\nfound Cynthia squinting heavily over the torn coat.\\n\\n\"I must say you ruined this yesterday,\" she remarked, looking up\\nfrom her needle, \"and if you\\'d listened to me you could have\\nstopped those horses just as well in your old jean clothes. I had\\na feeling that something was going to happen, when I saw you with\\nthis on.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t doubt it,\" he responded, woefully eyeing the garment\\nspread on her knees, \"and I may as well admit right now that I\\nmade a mess of the whole thing. To think of my wasting the only\\ndecent suit I had on a Fletcher--after saving up a year to buy\\nit, too.\"\\n\\nCynthia twitched the coat inside out and placed a square patch\\nover the ragged edges of the rent. \"I suppose I ought to be\\nthankful you saved the boy\\'s life,\" she observed, \"but I can\\'t\\nsay that I feel particularly jubilant when I look at these\\narmholes. Of course, when I first heard of it the coat seemed a\\nmere trifle, but when I come to the mending I begin to wish you\\'d\\nbeen heroic in your everyday clothes. There\\'ll have to be a patch\\nright here, but I don\\'t reckon it will show much. Do you mind?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather wear a mustard plaster than a patch any time,\" he\\nreplied gravely; \"but as long as there\\'s no help for it, lay them\\non--don\\'t slight the job a bit because of my feelings. I can\\nstand pretty well having my jean clothes darned and mended, but I\\ndo object to dressing up on Sundays in a bedquilt.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ll have to, that\\'s all,\" was Cynthia\\'s reassuring\\nrejoinder. \"It\\'s the price you pay for being a hero when you\\ncan\\'t afford it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. Shows Fletcher in a New Light\\n\\nResponding to a much-distracted telegram from Fletcher, Carraway\\narrived at the Hall early on the morning of Maria\\'s marriage, to\\narrange for the transfer to the girl of her smaller share in her\\ngrandfather\\'s wealth. In the reaction following the hysterical\\nexcitement over the accident, Fletcher had grown doubly\\nsolicitous about the future of the boy--feeling, apparently, that\\nthe value of his heir was increased by his having so nearly lost\\nhim. When Carraway found him he was bustling noisily about the\\nsick-room, walking on tiptoe with a tramp that shook the floor,\\nwhile Will lay gazing wearily at the sunlight which filtered\\nthrough the bright green shutters. Somewhere in the house a\\ncanary was trilling joyously, and the cheerful sound lent a\\npleasant animation to the otherwise depressing atmosphere. On his\\nway upstairs Carraway had met Maria running from the boy\\'s room,\\nwith her hair loose upon her shoulders, and she had stopped long\\nenough to show a smiling face on the subject of her marriage.\\nThere were to be only Fletcher, Miss Saidie and himself as\\nwitnesses, he gathered, Wyndham\\'s parents having held somewhat\\naloof from the connection--and within three hours at the most it\\nwould be over and the bridal pair beginning their long journey.\\nLooking down from the next landing, he had further assurance of\\nthe sincerity of Maria\\'s smile when he saw the lovers meet and\\nembrace within the shadow of the staircase; and the sight stirred\\nwithin his heart something of that wistful pity with which those\\nwho have learned how little emotion counts in life watch the\\nfirst exuberance of young passion. A bright beginning whatever be\\nthe ending, he thought a little sadly, as he turned the handle of\\nthe sick-room door.\\n\\nThe boy\\'s fever had risen and he tossed his arms restlessly upon\\nthe counterpane. \"Stand out of my sunshine, grandpa,\" he said\\nfretfully, as the lawyer sat down by his bedside.\\n\\nFletcher shuffled hastily from before the window, and it struck\\nCarraway almost ludicrously that in all the surroundings in which\\nhe had ever seen him the man had never appeared so hopelessly out\\nof place--not even when he had watched him at prayer one Sunday\\nin the little country church.\\n\\n\"There, you\\'re in it again,\" complained the boy in his peevish\\ntones.\\n\\nFletcher lifted a cup from the table and brought it over to the\\nbed.\\n\\n\"Maybe you\\'d like a sip of this beef tea now,\" he suggested\\npersuasively. \"It\\'s most time for your medicine, you know, so\\njest a little taste of this beforehand.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like it, grandpa; it\\'s too salt.\"\\n\\n\"Thar, now, that\\'s jest like Saidie,\" blurted Fletcher angrily.\\n\"Saidie, you\\'ve gone and made his beef tea too salt.\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie appeared instantly at the door of the adjoining room,\\nand without seeking to diminish the importance of her offense,\\nmildly offered to prepare a fresh bowl of the broth.\\n\\n\"I\\'m packing Maria\\'s clothes now,\" she said, \"but I\\'ll be through\\nin a jiffy, and then I\\'ll make the soup. I\\'ve jest fixed up the\\nparlour for the marriage. Maria insists on having a footstool to\\nkneel on--she ain\\'t satisfied with jest standing with jined hands\\nbefore the preacher, like her pa and ma did before she was born.\"\\n\\n\"Well, drat Maria\\'s whims,\" retorted Fletcher impatiently; \"they\\ncan wait, I reckon, and Will\\'s got to have his tea, so you\\'d\\nbetter fetch it.\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want it, grandpa,\" protested the boy, flushed and\\ntroubled. \"You worry me so, that\\'s all. Please stop fooling with\\nthose curtains. I like the sunshine.\"\\n\\n\"A nap is what he needs, I suspect,\" observed Carraway, touched,\\nin spite of himself, by the lumbering misery of the man.\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s it,\" agreed Fletcher, catching readily at the\\n\\nsuggestion. \"You jest turn right over and take yo\\' nap, and when\\nyou wake up well, I\\'ll give you anything you want. Here, swallow\\nthis stuff down quick and you\\'ll sleep easy.\"\\n\\nHe brought the medicine glass to the bedside, and, slipping his\\ngreat hairy hand under the pillow, gently raised the boy\\'s head.\\n\\n\"I reckon you\\'d like a brand new saddle when you git up,\" he\\nremarked in a coaxing voice.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather have a squirrel gun, grandpa; I want to go hunting.\"\\nFletcher\\'s face clouded.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid you\\'d git shot, sonny.\"\\n\\nWith his lips to the glass, Will paused to haggle over the price\\nof his obedience.\\n\\n\"But I want it,\" he insisted; \"and I want a pack of hounds, too,\\nto chase rabbits.\"\\n\\n\"Bless my boots! You ain\\'t going to bring any driveling beasts on\\nthe place, air you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I am, grandpa. I won\\'t swallow this unless you say I may.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you hurry up and git well, and then we\\'ll see--we\\'ll see,\"\\nwas Fletcher\\'s answer. \"Gulp this stuff right down now and turn\\nover.\"\\n\\nThe boy still hesitated.\\n\\n\"Then I may have the hounds,\" he said; \"that new litter of\\npuppies Tom Spade has, and I\\'ll get Christopher Blake to train\\n\\'em for me.\"\\n\\nThe pillow shook under his head, and as he opened his mouth to\\ndrink, a few drops of the liquid spilled upon the bedclothes.\\n\\n\"I reckon Zebbadee\\'s a better man for hounds,\" suggested\\nFletcher, setting down the glass.\\n\\n\"Oh, Zebbadee\\'s aren\\'t worth a cent--they can\\'t tell a rabbit\\nfrom a watering-pot. I want Christopher Blake to train \\'em, and I\\nwant to see him about it to-day. Tell him to come, grandpa.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, sonny--I can\\'t; you git your hounds and we\\'ll find a\\nbetter man. Why, thar\\'s Jim Weatherby; he\\'ll do first rate.\"\\n\\n\"His dogs are setters,\" fretted Will. \"I don\\'t want him; I want\\nChristopher Blake--he saved my life, you know.\"\\n\\n\"So he did, so he did,\" admitted Fletcher; \"and he shan\\'t be a\\nloser by that, suh,\" he added, turning to Carraway. \"When you go\\nover thar, you can carry my check along for five hundred\\ndollars.\"\\n\\nThe lawyer smiled. \"Oh, I\\'ll take it,\" he answered, \"and I\\'ll\\nvery likely bring it back.\"\\n\\nThe boy looked at Carraway. \"You tell him to come, sir,\" he\\npleaded. His eyes were so like Fletcher\\'s--small, sparkling,\\nchanging from blue to brown--that the lawyer\\'s glance lingered\\nupon the other\\'s features, seeking some resemblance in them,\\nalso. To his surprise he found absolutely none, the high,\\nblue-veined forehead beneath the chestnut hair, the straight,\\ndelicate nose; the sensitive, almost effeminate curve of the\\nmouth, must have descended from the \"worthless drab\" whom he had\\nbeheld in the severe white light of Fletcher\\'s scorn. For the\\nfirst time it occurred to Carraway that the illumination had been\\ntoo intense.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell him, certainly,\" he said quietly after a moment; \"but\\nI don\\'t promise that he\\'ll come, you understand.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I won\\'t thank him,\" cried the boy eagerly. \"It isn\\'t for\\nthat I want him--tell him so. Maria says he hates a fuss.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll deliver your message word for word,\" responded the lawyer.\\n\"Not only that, I\\'ll add my own persuasion to it, though I fear I\\nhave little influence with your neighbour.\"\\n\\n\"Tell him I beg him to come,\" insisted the boy, and the urgent\\nvoice remained with Carraway throughout the day.\\n\\nIt was not until the afternoon, however, when he had tossed his\\nfarewell handful of rice at the departing carriage and met\\nMaria\\'s last disturbed look at the Hall, that he found time to\\ncarry Will\\'s request and Fletcher\\'s check to Christopher Blake.\\nThe girl had shown her single trace of emotion over the boy\\'s\\npillow, where she had shed a few furtive tears, and the thought\\nof this was with Carraway as he walked meditatively along the red\\nclay road, down the long curves of which he saw the carriage\\nrolling leisurely ahead of him. As a bride, Maria puzzled him no\\nless than she had done at their first meeting, and the riddle of\\nher personality he felt to be still hopelessly unsolved. Was it\\nmerely repression of manner that annoyed him in her he\\nquestioned, or was it, as he had once believed, the simple lack\\nof emotional power? Her studied speech, her conventional\\ncourtesy, seemed to confirm the first impression she had made;\\nthen her dark, troubled gaze and the sullen droop of her mouth\\nreturned to give the lie to what he could but feel to be a\\npossible misjudgment. In the end, he concluded wisely enough\\nthat, like the most of us, she was probably but plastic matter\\nfor the mark of circumstance--that her development would be,\\nafter all, according to the events she was called upon to face.\\nThe possibility that Destiny, which is temperament, should have\\nalready selected her as one of those who come into their\\nspiritual heritage only through defeat, did not enter into the\\nhalf-humorous consideration with which he now regarded her.\\n\\nTurning presently into the sunken road by the ice-pond, he came\\nin a little while to the overgrown fence surrounding the Blake\\nfarm. In the tobacco field beyond the garden he saw Christopher\\'s\\nblue-clad figure rising from a blur of green, and, following the\\nragged path amid the yarrow, he joined the young man where he\\nstood at work.\\n\\nAs the lawyer reached his side Christopher glanced up\\nindifferently to give a nod of welcome. His crop had all been\\ncut, and be was now engaged in hanging the wilting plants from\\nlong rails supported by forked poles. At his feet there were\\nlittle green piles of tobacco, and around him from the sunbaked\\nearth rose a headless army of bruised and bleeding stubble.\\n\\nSo thriftless were the antiquated methods he followed that the\\nlawyer, as he watched him, could barely repress a smile. Two\\nhundred years ago the same crop was probably raised, cut and\\ncured on the same soil in the same careless and primitive\\nfashion. Beneath all the seeming indifference to success or\\nfailure Carraway discerned something of that blind reliance upon\\nchance which is apt to be the religious expression of a rural and\\nisolated people.\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll leave it out awhile, I reckon, unless the weather\\nchanges,\" replied Christopher, in answer to the lawyer\\'s inquiry.\\n\\n\"Well, it promises fair enough,\" returned Carraway pleasantly.\\n\"They tell me, by the way, that the yellow, sun-cured leaf is\\ncoming into favour in the market. You don\\'t try that, eh?\"\\n\\nChristopher shook his head, and, kneeling on the ground,\\ncarelessly sorted his pile of plants. \"I learned to cure it\\nindoors,\" he answered, and I reckon I\\'ll keep to the old way. The\\ndark leaf is what the people about here like--it makes the\\nsweeter chew, they think. As for me, I hate the very smell of\\nit.\" \"That\\'s odd, and I\\'ll wager you\\'re the only man in the\\ncounty who neither smokes nor chews.\" \"Oh, I handle it, you see.\\nThe smell and the stain of it are well soaked in. I sometimes\\nwonder if all the water in the river of Jordan could wash away\\nthe blood of the tobacco worm.\" With a laugh in which there was\\nmore bitterness than mirth, he stretched out his big bronzed\\nhands, and Carraway saw that the nails and finger-tips were dyed\\nbright green. \"It does leave its mark,\" observed the lawyer, and\\nfelt instantly that the speech was inane. Christopher went on\\nquietly with his work, gathering up the plants and hanging the\\nslit stalks over the long poles, while the peculiar heavy odour\\nof the freshly cut crop floated unpleasantly about them. For a\\ntime Carraway watched him in silence, his eyes dwelling soberly\\nupon the stalwart figure. In spite of himself, the mere beauty of\\noutline touched him with a feeling of sadness, and when he spoke\\nat last it was in a lowered tone. \"You have, perhaps, surmised\\nthat my call is not entirely one of pleasure,\" he began\\nawkwardly; \"that I am, above all, the bearer of a message from\\nMr. Fletcher.\" \"From Fletcher?\" repeated Christopher coolly.\\n\"Well, I never heard a message of his yet that wasn\\'t better left\\nundelivered.\" \"I am sure I am correct in saying,\" Carraway went\\non steadily and not without definite purpose, \"that he hopes you\\nwill be generous enough to let bygones be bygones.\" Christopher\\nnodded. \"He feels, of course,\" pursued the lawyer, \"that his\\nobligation to you is greater than he can hope to repay. Indeed, I\\nthink if you knew the true state of the case your judgment of him\\nwould be softened. The boy--who so nearly lost his life is the\\none human being whom Fletcher loves better than himself--better\\nthan his own soul, I had almost said.\"\\n\\nChristopher looked up attentively. \"Who\\'d have thought it,\" he\\nmuttered beneath his breath. Judging that he had at last made a\\nbeginning at the plastering over of old scars, Carraway went on\\nas if the other had not spoken. \"So jealous is his affection in\\nthis instance, that I believe his granddaughter\\'s marriage is\\nsomething of a relief to him. He is positively impatient of any\\ninfluence over the boy except his own--and that, I fear, is\\nhardly for good.\" Picking up a clod of earth, Christopher\\ncrumbled it slowly to dust. \"So the little chap comes in for all\\nthis, does he?\" he asked, as his gaze swept over the wide fields\\nin the distance. \"He comes in for all that is mine by right, and\\nFletcher\\'s intention is, I dare say, that he\\'ll reflect honour\\nupon the theft?\" \"That he\\'ll reflect honour upon the name--yes.\\nIt is the ambition of his grandfather, I believe, that the lad\\nshould grow up to be respected in the county--to stand for\\nsomething more than he himself has done.\" \"Well, he\\'ll hardly\\nstand for more of a rascal,\" remarked Christopher quietly; and\\nthen, as his eyes rested on the landscape, he appeared to follow\\nmoodily some suggestion which had half escaped him. \"Then the way\\nto touch the man is through the boy, I presume,\" he said\\nabruptly.\\n\\nArrested by the words, the lawyer looked down quickly, but the\\nother, still kneeling upon the ground, was fingering a plant he\\nhad just picked up. \"Fine leaves, eh?\" was the remark that met\\nCarraway\\'s sudden start.\\n\\n\"To touch him, yes,\" replied the lawyer thoughtfully. \"Whatever\\nheart he has is given to his grandson, and when you saved the\\nlad\\'s life the other day you placed Fletcher in your debt for\\ngood. Of his gratitude I am absolutely sure, and as a slight\\nexpression of it he asked me to hand you this.\"\\n\\nHe drew the check from his pocket, and leaning over, held it out\\nto Christopher. To his surprise, the young man took it from him,\\nbut the next moment he had torn it roughly in two and handed it\\nback again. \"So you may as well return it to him,\" he said, and,\\nrising slowly from the ground, he stood pushing the loose plants\\ntogether with his foot.\\n\\n\"I feared as much,\" observed Carraway, placing the torn slip of\\npaper in his pocket. \"Your grudge is of too long standing to mend\\nin a day. Be that as it may, I have a request to make of you from\\nthe boy himself which I hope you will not refuse. He has taken a\\nliking to you, it appears, and as he will probably be ill for\\nsome weeks, he begs that you will come back with me to see him.\"\\n\\nHe finished a little wistfully, and stood looking up at the young\\nman who towered a good head and shoulders above him.\\n\\n\"I may as well tell you once for all,\" returned Christopher,\\nchoking over the words, \"that you\\'ve given me as much of Fletcher\\nas I can stand and a long sight more than I want. If anybody but\\nyou had brought me that piece of paper with Bill Fletcher\\'s name\\ntagged to it I\\'d have rammed it down his throat before this. As\\nit is, you may tell him from me that when I have paid him to the\\nlast drop what I owe him--and not till then--will I listen to any\\nmessage he chooses to send me. I hate him, and that\\'s my affair;\\nI mean to be even with him some day, and I reckon that\\'s my\\naffair, too. One thing I\\'m pretty sure of, and that is that it\\'s\\nnot yours. Is your visit over, or will you come into the house?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be going back now,\" replied the lawyer, shrinking from the\\noutburst, \"but if I may have the pleasure, I\\'ll call upon your\\nmother in the morning.\"\\n\\nChristopher shook the hand which he held out, and then spoke\\nagain in the same muffled voice. \"You may tell him one thing\\nmore,\" he pursued, \"and that is, that it\\'s the gospel truth I\\ndidn\\'t know it was his grandson in the wagon. Why, man, there\\'s\\nnot a Fletcher on this earth whose neck I\\'d lift my little finger\\nto save!\"\\n\\nThen, as Carraway passed slowly along the ragged path to the\\nsunken road, he stood looking after him with a heavy frown upon\\nhis brow. His rage was at white heat within him, and, deny it as\\nhe would, he knew now that within the last few weeks his hatred\\nhad been strengthened by the force of a newer passion which had\\nrecoiled upon itself. Since his parting with Maria Fletcher the\\nday before, he had not escaped for a breath from her haunting\\npresence. She was in his eyes and in the air he breathed; the\\nsmell of flowers brought her sweetness to him, and the very\\nsunshine lying upon the September fields thrilled him like the\\nwarmth of her rare smile. He found himself fleeing like a hunted\\nanimal from the memory which he could not put away, and despite\\nthe almost frenzied haste with which he presently fell to work,\\nhe saw always the light and gracious figure which had come to him\\nalong the red clay road. The fervour which had shone suddenly in\\nher eyes, the quiver of her mouth as she turned away, the poise\\nof her head, the gentle, outstretched hand he had repulsed, the\\ndelicate curve of her wrist beneath the falling sleeve, the very\\nlace on her bosom fluttering in the still weather as if a light\\nwind were blowing--these things returned to torture him like the\\ndelirium of fever. Appealing as the memory was, it aroused in his\\ndistorted mind all the violence of his old fury, and he felt\\nagain the desire for revenge working like madness in his blood.\\nIt was as if every emotion of his life swept on, to empty itself\\nat last into the wide sea of his hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII. In Which Hero and Villain Appear as One\\n\\nA month later Christopher\\'s conversation with Carraway returned\\nto him, when, coming one morning from the house with his dogs at\\nhis heels and his squirrel gun on his shoulder, he found Will\\nFletcher and a troop of spotted foxhound puppies awaiting him\\noutside the whitewashed gate.\\n\\n\"I want to speak to you a moment, Mr. Blake,\" began the boy, in\\nthe assured tones of the rich man to the poor. The Blake hounds\\nmade a sudden rush at the puppies, to be roughly ordered to heel\\nby their master.\\n\\n\"Well, fire away,\" returned the young man coolly. \"But I may as\\nwell warn you that it\\'s more than likely it will be a clear waste\\nof breath. I\\'ll have nothing to do with you or your sort.\" He\\nleaned on his gun and looked indifferently over the misty fields,\\nwhere the autumn\\'s crop of lifeeverlasting shone silver in the\\nsunrise.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see why you hate me so,\" said the boy wonderingly,\\nchecking the too frolicsome adventures of the puppies in the\\ndirection of the hounds. \"I\\'ve always liked you, you know, even\\nbefore you saved my life--because you\\'re the straightest shot and\\nthe best trainer of hounds about here. Grandpa says I mustn\\'t\\nhave anything to do with you, but I will anyway, if I please.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you will, will you?\" was Christopher\\'s rejoinder, as he\\nsurveyed him with the humorous contempt which the strong so often\\nfeel for the weak of the same sex. \"Well, I suppose I\\'ll have my\\nsay in the matter, and strangely enough I\\'m on your grandfather\\'s\\nside. The clearer you keep of me the better it will be for you,\\nmy man.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just like grandpa all over again,\" protested the boy; and\\nwhen it comes to that, he needn\\'t know anything about it--he\\ndoesn\\'t know half that I do, anyway; he blusters so about\\nthings.\"\\n\\nChristopher\\'s gaze returned slowly from the landscape and rested\\ninquiringly upon the youthful features before him, seeking in\\nthem some definite promise of the future. The girlish look of the\\nmouth irritated him ludicrously, and half-forgotten words of\\nCarraway\\'s awoke within his memory.\\n\\n\"Fletcher loves but one thing on this earth, and his ambition is\\nthat the boy shall be respected in the county.\" A Fletcher\\nrespected in the very stronghold of a Blake! He laughed aloud,\\nand then spoke hurriedly as if to explain the surprising mirth in\\nhis outburst.\\n\\n\"So you came to pay a visit to your nearest neighbour and are\\nafraid your grandfather will find it out? Then you\\'ll get a\\nspanking, I dare say.\"\\n\\nWill blushed furiously, and stood awkwardly scraping up a pile of\\nsand with the sole of his boot. \"I\\'m not a baby,\" he blurted out\\nat last, \"and I\\'ll go where I like, whatever he says.\"\\n\\n\"He keeps a pretty close watch over you, I reckon. Perhaps he\\'s\\nafraid you\\'ll become a man and step into his shoes before he\\nknows it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he can\\'t find me out, all the same,\" said the boy slyly. \"He\\nthinks I\\'ve gone over to Mr. Morrison\\'s now to do my Greek--he\\'s\\ncrazy about my learning Greek, and I hate it--and, you bet your\\nlife, he\\'ll be hopping mad if he finds I\\'ve given him the slip.\"\\n\\n\"He will, will he?\" remarked Christopher, and the thought\\nappeared to afford him a peculiar satisfaction. For the first\\ntime the frown left his brow and his tone lost its insolent\\ncontempt. Then he came forward suddenly and laid his hand upon\\nthe gate. \"Well, I can\\'t waste my morning,\" he said. \"You\\'d\\nbetter run back home and play the piano. I\\'m off.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t play the piano--I\\'m not a girl,\" declared the boy; \"and\\nwhat I want is to get you to train my hounds for me. I\\'d like to\\ngo hunting with you to-day.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I can\\'t be bothered with babies,\" sneered Christopher in\\nreply. \"You\\'d fall down, most likely, and scratch your knees on\\nthe briers, and then you\\'d run straight home to blab to\\nFletcher.\"\\n\\n\"I won\\'t!\" cried Will angrily. \"I\\'ll never blab. He\\'d be too mad,\\nI tell you, if he found it out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t want you anyhow, so get out of my way. You\\'d\\nbetter look sharp after your pups or the hounds will chew them\\nup.\"\\n\\nThe boy stood midway of the road, kicking the dust impatiently\\nahead of him. His lips quivered with disappointment, and the\\nexpression gave them a singularly wistful beauty. \"I\\'ll give you\\nall my pocket money if you\\'ll take me with you,\" he pleaded\\nsuddenly, stretching out a handful of silver.\\n\\nWith a snarl Christopher pushed his arm roughly aside. \"Put up\\nyour money, you fool,\" he said; \"I don\\'t want it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t, don\\'t you?\" taunted the other, raging with\\nwounded pride. \"Why, grandpa says you\\'re as poor as Job\\'s turkey\\nafter it was plucked.\"\\n\\nIt was an old joke of Fletcher\\'s, who, in giving utterance to it,\\nlittle thought of the purpose it would finally be made to serve,\\nfor Christopher, halting suddenly at the words, swung round in\\nthe cloud of dust and stood regarding the grandson of his enemy\\nwith a thoughtful and troubled look. The lawyer\\'s words sounded\\nso distinctly in his ears that he glanced at the boy with a\\nstart, fearing that they had been spoken aloud: \"His grandson is\\nthe sole living thing that Fletcher loves.\" Again the\\nrecollection brought a laugh from him, which he carelessly threw\\noff upon the frolics of the puppies. Then the frown settled\\nslowly back upon his brow, and the brutal look, which Carraway\\nhad found so disfiguring, crept out about his mouth.\\n\\n\"I tell you honestly,\" he said gruffly, \"that if you knew what\\nwas good for you, you\\'d scoot back along that road a good deal\\nfaster than you came. If you\\'re such a headstrong fool as to want\\nto come with me, however, I reckon you may do it. One thing,\\nthough, I\\'ll have no puling ways.\"\\n\\nThe boy jumped with pleasure. \"Why, I knew all the time I\\'d get\\naround you,\" he answered.\\n\\n\"I always do when I try; and may I shoot some with your shotgun?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll teach you, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"When? Shall we start now? Call the dogs together--they\\'re nosing\\nin the ditch.\"\\n\\nWithout taking the trouble to reply, Christopher strode off\\nbriskly along the road, and after waiting a moment to assemble\\nhis scattered puppies, Will caught up with him and broke into a\\nrunning pace at his side. As they swung onward the two shadows--\\nthe long one and the short one--stretched straight and black\\nbehind them in the sunlight.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the biggest man about here, aren\\'t you?\" the boy asked\\nsuddenly, glancing upward with frank admiration.\\n\\n\"I dare say. What of it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, nothing; and your father was the biggest man of his time,\\nSol Peterkin says; and Aunt Mehitable remembers your grandfather,\\nand he was the tallest man alive in his day. Who\\'ll be the\\nbiggest when you die, I wonder? And, I say, isn\\'t it a pity that\\nsuch tall men had to live in such a little old house--I don\\'t see\\nhow they ever got in the doors without stooping. Do you have to\\nstoop when you go in and out?\"\\n\\nChristopher nodded.\\n\\n\"Well, I shouldn\\'t like that,\" pursued Will; \"and I\\'m glad I\\ndon\\'t live in such a little place. Now, the doors at the Hall are\\nso high that I could stand on your shoulders and go in without\\nbending my head. Let\\'s try it some day. Grandpa wouldn\\'t know.\"\\n\\nChristopher turned and looked at him suddenly. \"What would you\\nsay to going \\'possum hunting one night?\" he asked in a queer\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"Whoopee!\" cried the boy, tossing his hat in the air. \"Will you\\ntake me?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s hard work, you know,\" went on the other thoughtfully.\\n\"You\\'d have to get up in the middle of the night and steal out of\\nthe window without your grandfather\\'s knowing it.\"\\n\\n\"I should say so!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'d tramp till morning, probably, with the hounds, and Tom\\nSpade would come along to bring his lanterns. Then when it was\\nover we\\'d wind up for drinks at his store. It\\'s great sport, I\\ntell you, but it takes a man to stand it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m man enough by now.\"\\n\\n\"Not according to your grandfather\\'s thinking.\"\\n\\n\"What does he know about it? He\\'s just an old fogy himself.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see, we\\'ll see. If he wants to keep you tied to nurse\\'s\\nstrings too long, we must play him a trick. Why, when I was\\nfourteen I could shoot with any man about here--and drink with\\nhim, too, for that matter. Nobody kept me back, you see.\"\\n\\nThe boy looked up at Christopher with sparkling eyes, in which\\nthe eternal hero-worship of youth was already kindled.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re splendid!\" he exclaimed, \"and I\\'m going to be just\\nlike you. Grandpa shan\\'t keep me a baby any longer, I can tell\\nyou. All this Greek, now--he\\'s crazy about my learning it--and I\\nhate it. Do you know Greek?\"\\n\\nChristopher laughed shortly. \"Where does he live?\" he inquired\\nmockingly.\\n\\nFor a moment the boy looked at him perplexed. \"It\\'s a language,\"\\nhe replied gravely; \"and grandpa says it comes handy in a\\nbargain, but I won\\'t learn it. I hate school, anyway, and he\\nswears he\\'s going to send me back in two weeks. I hope I\\'ll fall\\nill, and then he can\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"In two weeks,\" repeated the other reflectively; \"well, a good\\ndeal may happen, I reckon, in two weeks.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, lots!\" agreed the boy with enthusiasm; \"you\\'ll let me chase\\nrabbits with you every day--won\\'t you? and teach me to shoot? and\\nwe\\'ll go \\'possum hunting one night and not get home till morning.\\nIt will be easy enough to fool grandpa. I\\'ll take care of that,\\nand if Aunt Saidie finds it out she\\'ll never tell him--she never\\ndoes tell on me. Here, let me take the gun awhile, will you?\"\\n\\nChristopher handed him the gun, and they went on rapidly along\\nthe old road under the honey locusts that grew beyond the bend.\\nThey were nearing the place where Christopher, as a child of\\ntwelve, had waited with his birdgun in the bushes to shoot\\nFletcher when he came in sight, and now as the recollection\\nreturned to him he unconsciously slackened his pace and cast his\\neyes about for the spot where he had stood. It was all there just\\nas it had been that morning--the red clumps of sumach covered\\nwith gray dust, the dried underbrush piled along the fence, and\\nthe brown honeyshucks strewn in the sunny road. For the first\\ntime in his life he was glad at this instant that he had not\\nkilled Fletcher then--that his hand had been stayed that day to\\nfall the heavier, it might be, at the appointed time. The boy\\nstill chatted eagerly, and when presently the hounds scented a\\nrabbit in the sassafras beyond the fence, he started with a shout\\nat the heels of the pursuing pack. Swinging himself over the\\nbrushwood, Christopher followed slowly across the waste of\\nlifeeverlasting, tearing impatiently through the flowering net\\nwhich the wild potato vine cast about his feet.\\n\\nThrough the brilliant October day they hunted over the ragged\\nfields, resting at noon to eat the slices of bread and bacon\\nwhich Christopher had brought in his pocket. As they lay at full\\nlength in the sunshine upon the lifeeverlasting, the young man\\'s\\ngaze flew like a bird across the landscape--where the gaily\\ndecorated autumn fallows broke in upon the bare tobacco fields\\nlike gaudy patches on a homely garment--to rest upon the far-off\\nhuddled chimneys of Blake Hall. For a time he looked steadily\\nupon them; then, turning on his side, he drew his harvest hat\\nover his eyes and began a story of his early adventures behind\\nthe hounds, speaking in half-gay, half-bitter tones.\\n\\nIn the mild autumn weather a faint haze overhung the landscape,\\nchanging from violet to gray as the shadows rose or fell. Around\\nthem the unploughed wasteland swept clear to the distant road,\\nwhich wound like a muddy river beside the naked tobacco fields.\\nLying within the slight depression of a hilltop, the two were\\nburied deep amid the lifeeverlasting, which shed its soft dust\\nupon them and filled their nostrils with its ghostly fragrance.\\n\\nAs he went on, Christopher found a savage delight in mocking the\\nrefinements of the boy\\'s language, in tossing him coarse\\nexpressions and brutal oaths much as he tossed scraps to the\\nhounds, in touching with vulgar scorn all the conventional ideals\\nof the household--obedience, duty, family affection, religion\\neven. While he sank still lower in that defiant self-respect to\\nwhich he had always clung doggedly until to-day, there was a\\nfierce satisfaction in the knowledge that as he fell he dragged\\nWill Fletcher with him--that he had sold himself to the devil and\\ngot his price.\\n\\nThis unholy joy was still possessing him when at nightfall,\\nexhausted, dirty, brier-scratched, and bearing their strings of\\ngame, they reached Tom Spade\\'s, and Christopher demanded raw\\nwhisky in the little room behind the store. Sol Peterkin was\\nthere, astride his barrel, and as they entered he gave breath to\\na low whistle of astonishment.\\n\\n\"Why, your grandpa\\'s been sweepin\\' up the county for you!\" he\\nexclaimed to Will.\\n\\n\"So he\\'s found out I wasn\\'t at the Morrisons\\',\" said the boy a\\nlittle nervously. \"I\\'d better be going home, I reckon, and get it\\nover.\"\\n\\nChristopher drained his glass of whisky, and then, refilling it,\\npushed it across the table.\\n\\n\"What! Aren\\'t you man enough to swallow a thimbleful?\" he asked,\\nwith a laugh. His face was flushed, and the dust of the roads\\nshowed in streaks upon his forehead, where the crown of his straw\\nhat had drawn a circle around his moist fair hair. The hand with\\nwhich he touched the glass trembled slightly, and his eyes were\\nso reckless that, after an instants\\' frightened silence. Peterkin\\ncried out in alarm: \"For the Lord\\'s sake, Mr. Christopher, you\\'re\\nnot yourself--it\\'s the way his father went, you know!\"\\n\\n\"What of it?\" demanded Christopher, turning his dangerous look\\nupon the little man. \"If there\\'s a merrier way to go, I\\'d like to\\nknow it.\"\\n\\nPeterkin drew over to the table and laid a restraining hold on\\nthe boy\\'s arm. \"Put that down, sonny,\" he said. \"I couldn\\'t stand\\nit, and you may be sure it\\'ll do you no good. It will turn your\\nstomach clean inside out.\"\\n\\n\"He took it,\" replied the boy stubbornly, \"and I\\'ll drink it if\\nhe says so.\" He lifted the glass and stood looking inquiringly at\\nthe man across from him. \"Shall I drink it?\" he asked, and waited\\nwith a boyish swagger.\\n\\nChristopher gave a short nod. \"Oh, not if you\\'re afraid of it,\"\\nhe responded roughly; and then, as Will threw back his head and\\nthe whisky touched his lips, the other struck out suddenly and\\nsent the glass shivering to the floor. \"Go home, you fool!\" he\\ncried, \"and keep clear of me for good and all.\"\\n\\nA moment afterward he had passed from the room, through the\\nstore, and was out upon the road.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. Between the Devil and the Deep Sea\\n\\nThere was a cheerful blaze in the old lady\\'s parlour, and she was\\nsitting placidly in her Elizabethan chair, the yellow cat dozing\\nat her footstool. Lila paced slowly up and down the room, her\\nhead bent a little sideways, as she listened to Tucker\\'s cheerful\\nvoice reading the evening chapter from the family Bible. His\\ncrutch, still strapped to his right shoulder, trailed behind him\\non the floor, and the smoky oil lamp threw his eccentric shadow\\non the whitewashed wall, where it hung grimacing like a grotesque\\nfrom early Gothic art.\\n\\n\"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown\\nit,\" he read in his even tones; \"if a man would give all the\\nsubstance of his house for love, it would utterly be condemned.\"\\n\\nThe old lady tapped the arm of her chair and turned her sightless\\neyes upon the Bible, as if Solomon in person stood there awaiting\\njudgment.\\n\\n\"I always liked that verse, brother,\" she remarked, \"though I am\\nnot sure that I consider it entirely proper reading for the\\nyoung. Aren\\'t you tired walking, Lila?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, mother.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we mustn\\'t take the Scriptures literally, you know, my\\nchild; if we did, I fear a great deal of trouble would come of\\nit--and surely it is a pity to magnify the passion of love when\\nso very many estimable persons get along quite comfortably\\nwithout it. You remember my remarking how happy Miss Belinda\\nMorrison always appeared to be, and so far as I know she never\\nhad a suitor in her life, though she lived to be upward of\\neighty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, mother! and yet you were so madly in love with father--you\\nremember the fancy ball.\"\\n\\n\"The fancy ball occupied only one night, my dear, and I\\'ve had\\nalmost seventy years. I married for love, as you certainly\\nknow--at my age, I suppose I might as well admit it--but the\\nmarriage happened to be also entirely suitable, and I hope that I\\nshould never have been guilty of anything so indelicate as to\\nfall in love with a gentleman who wasn\\'t a desirable match.\"\\n\\nLila flushed and bit her lip.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care about stations in life, nor blood, nor anything\\nlike that,\" she protested.\\n\\nThe old lady sighed. \"We won\\'t have any more of Solomon, Tucker,\\n\"she observed. \"I fear he will put notions into the child\\'s head.\\nNot care about blood, indeed! What are we coming to, I wonder?\\nWell, well, I suppose it is what I deserve for allowing myself to\\nfall so madly in love with your father. When I look back now it\\nseems to me that I could have achieved quite as much with a great\\ndeal less expenditure of emotion.\"\\n\\n\"Now, now, Lucy, \" said Tucker, closing the gilt clasps of the\\nBible, \"you\\'re not yet seventy, and by the time you reach eighty\\nyou will see things clearer. I\\'m a good deal younger than you,\\nbut I\\'m two-thirds in the grave already, which makes a\\ndifference. My life\\'s been long and pleasant as it is, but when I\\nglance back upon it now I tell you the things I regret least in\\nit are my youthful follies. A man must be very far in his dotage,\\nindeed, when he begins to wear a long face over the sharp breaths\\nthat he drew in youth. I came very near ruining myself for a\\nwoman once, and the fact that I was ready to do it--even though I\\ndidn\\'t--is what in the past I like best to recall to-day. It\\nmakes it all easier and better, somehow, and it seems to put a\\nzest into the hours I spend now on my old bench. To have had one\\nemotion that was bigger than you or your universe is to have had\\nlife, my dear.\"\\n\\nThe old lady wiped her eyes. \"It may be so, brother, it may be\\nso,\" she admitted; \"but not before Lila. Is that you,\\nChristopher?\"\\n\\nThe young man came in and crossed slowly to the fire, bending for\\nan instant over her chair. He was conscious suddenly that his\\nclothes smelled of the fields and that the cold water of the well\\nhad not cleansed his face and hands. All at once it came to him\\nwith something of a shock that this bare, refined poverty was\\nbeyond his level--that about himself there was a coarseness, a\\nbrutality even, that made him shrink from contact with these\\nothers--with his mother, with Lila, with poor, maimed Tucker in\\nhis cotton suit. Was it only a distinction in manner, he wondered\\nresentfully, or did the difference lie still deeper in some\\nunlikeness of soul? For the first time in his life he felt ill at\\nease in the presence of those he loved, and as his eyes dwelt\\nmoodily on Lila\\'s graceful figure--upon the swell of her low\\nbosom, her swaying hips, and the free movement of her limbs--he\\nasked himself bitterly if he had aught in common with so delicate\\nand rare a thing? And she? Was her blithe acquiescence, after\\nall, but an assumed virtue, to whose outward rags she clung? Was\\nit possible that there was here no inward rebellion, none of that\\nwarfare against Destiny which at once inspirited and embittered\\nhis heart?\\n\\nHis face grew dark, and Uncle Boaz, coming in to stir the fire,\\nglanced up at him and sighed.\\n\\n\"You sho\\' do look down in de mouf, Marse Chris,\" he observed.\\n\\nChristopher started and then laughed blankly. \"Well, I\\'m not\\nproof against troubles, I reckon,\" he returned. \"They\\'re things\\nnone of us can keep clear of, you know.\"\\n\\nUncle Boaz chuckled under his breath. \"Go \\'way f\\'om yer, Marse\\nChris; w\\'at you know \\'bout trouble--you ain\\' even mah\\'ed yet.\"\\n\\n\"Now, now, Boaz, don\\'t be putting any ideas against marriage in\\nhis head,\" broke in the old lady. \"He has remained single too\\nlong as it is, for, as dear old Bishop Deane used to say, it is\\nsurely the duty of every gentleman to take upon himself the\\nprovision of at least one helpless female. Not that I wish you to\\nenter into marriage hastily, my son, or for any merely\\nsentimental reasons; but I am sure, as things are, I believe one\\nmay have a great many trials even if one remains single, and\\nthough I know, of course, that I\\'ve had my share of trouble,\\nstill I never blamed your poor father one instant--not even for\\nthe loss of my six children, which certainly would not have\\nhappened if I had not married him. But, as I\\'ve often told you,\\nmy dear, I think marriage should be rightly regarded more as a\\nduty than as a pleasure. Your Aunt Susannah always said it was\\nlike choosing a partner at a ball; for my part, I think it\\nresembles more the selecting of a brand of flour.\"\\n\\n\"And to think that she once cried herself sick because\\nChristopher went hunting during the honeymoon!\" exclaimed Tucker,\\nwith his pleasant laugh.\\n\\n\"Ah, life is long, and one\\'s honeymoon is only a month, brother,\"\\nretorted the old lady; \"and I\\'m not saying anything against love,\\nyou know, when it comes to that. Properly conducted, it is a very\\npleasant form of entertainment. I\\'ve enjoyed it mightily myself;\\nbut I\\'m nearing seventy, and the years of love seem very small\\nwhen I look back. There are many interesting things in a long\\nlife, and love for a man is only one among them; which brings me,\\nafter all, to the conclusion that the substance of anybody\\'s\\nhouse is a large price to pay for a single feeling.\"\\n\\nChristopher leaned over her and held out his arms.\\n\\n\"It is your bedtime, mother--shall I carry you across?\" he asked;\\nand as the old lady nodded, he lifted her as if she were a child\\nand held her closely against his breast, feeling his tenderness\\nrevive at the clasp of her fragile hands. When he placed her upon\\nher bed, he kissed her good-night and went up the narrow\\nstaircase, stooping carefully to avoid the whitewashed ceiling\\nabove.\\n\\nOnce in his room, he threw off his coat and sat down upon the\\nside of his narrow bed, glancing contemptuously at his bare brown\\narms, which showed through the openings in his blue shirt\\nsleeves. He was still smarting from the memory of the sudden\\nselfconsciousness he had felt downstairs, and a pricking\\nsensitiveness took possession of him, piercing like needles\\nthrough the boorish indifference he had worn. All at once he\\nrealised that he was ashamed of himself--ashamed of his\\nignorance, his awkwardness, his brutality--and with the shame\\nthere awoke the slow anger of a sullen beast. Fate had driven him\\nlike a whipped hound to the kennel, but he could still snarl back\\nhis defiance from the shadow of his obscurity. The strong\\nmasculine beauty of his face--the beauty, as Cynthia had said, of\\nthe young David--confronted him in the little greenish mirror\\nabove the bureau, and in the dull misery of the eyes he read\\nthose higher possibilities, which even to-day he could not regard\\nwithout a positive pang. What he might have been seemed forever\\nstruggling in his look with what he was, like the Scriptural\\nwrestle between the angel of the Lord and the brute. The soul,\\ndistorted, bruised, defeated, still lived within him, and it was\\nthis that brought upon him those hours of mortal anguish which he\\nhad so vainly tried to drown in his glass. From the mirror his\\ngaze passed to his red and knotted hand, with its blunted nails,\\nand the straight furrow grew deeper between his eyebrows. He\\nremembered suddenly that his earliest ambition--the ambition of\\nhis childhood--had been that of a gentlemanly scholar of the old\\norder. He had meant to sit in a library and read Horace, or to\\ncomplete the laborious translation of the \"Iliad\" which his\\nfather had left unfinished. Then his studies had ended abruptly\\nwith the Greek alphabet, and from the library he had passed out\\nto the plough. In the years of severe physical labour which\\nfollowed he had felt the spirit of the student go out of him\\nforever, and after a few winter nights, when he fell asleep over\\nhis books, he had sunk slowly to the level of the small tobacco\\ngrowers among whom he lived. With him also was the curse of\\napathy--that hereditary instinct to let the single throw decide\\nthe issue, so characteristic of the reckless Blakes. For more\\nthan two hundred years his people had been gay and careless\\nlivers on this very soil; among them all he knew of not one who\\nhad gone without the smallest of his desires, nor of one who had\\npermitted his left hand to learn what his right one cast away.\\nBig, blithe, mettlesome, they passed before him in a long, comely\\nline, flushed with the pleasant follies which had helped to sap\\nthe courage in their descendants\\' veins.\\n\\nAt first he had made a pitiable attempt to remain \"within his\\nclass,\" but gradually, as time went on, this, too, had left him,\\nand in the end he had grown to feel a certain pride in the\\nignorance he had formerly despised--a clownish scorn of anything\\nabove the rustic details of his daily life. There were days even\\nwhen he took a positive pleasure in the degree of his abasement,\\nwhen but for his blind mother he would have gone dirty, spoken in\\ndialect, and eaten with the hounds. What he dreaded most now were\\nthe rare moments of illumination in which he beheld his\\ndegradation by a blaze of light--moments such as this when he\\nseemed to stand alone upon the edge of the world, with the devil\\nawaiting him when he should turn at last. Years ago he had\\nescaped these periods by strong physical exertion, working\\nsometimes in the fields until he dropped upon the earth and lay\\nlike a log for hours. Later, he had yielded to drink when the\\ndarkness closed over him, and upon several occasions he had sat\\nall night with a bottle of whisky in Tom Spade\\'s store. Both\\nmethods he felt now to be ineffectual; fatigue could not deaden\\nnor could whisky drown the bitterness of his soul. One thing\\nremained, and that was to glut his hatred until it should lie\\nquiet like a gorged beast.\\n\\nSteps sounded all at once upon the staircase, and after a moment\\nthe door opened and Cynthia entered.\\n\\n\"Did you see Fletcher\\'s boy, Christopher?\" she asked. \"His\\ngrandfather was over here looking for him.\"\\n\\n\"Fletcher over here? Well, of all the impudence!\"\\n\\n\"He was very uneasy, but he stopped long enough to ask me to\\npersuade you to part with the farm. He\\'d give three thousand\\ndollars down for it, he said.\"\\n\\nShe dusted the bureau abstractedly with her checked apron and\\nthen stood looking wistfully into the mirror.\\n\\n\"Is that so? If he\\'d give me three million I wouldn\\'t take it,\"\\nanswered Christopher.\\n\\n\"It seems a mistake, dear,\" said Cynthia softly; \"of course, I\\'d\\nhate to oblige Fletcher, too, but we are so poor, and the money\\nwould mean so much to us. I used to feel as you do, but somehow I\\nseem all worn out now--soul as well as body. I haven\\'t the\\nstrength left to hate.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I have,\" returned Christopher shortly, \"and I\\'ll have it\\nwhen I\\'m gasping over my last breath. You needn\\'t bother about\\nthat business, Cynthia; I can keep up the family record on my own\\naccount. What\\'s the proverb about us--\\'a Blake can hate twice as\\nlong as most men can love\\'--that\\'s my way, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t finish it,\" said Cynthia, turning from the bureau;\\n\"it\\'s all downstairs in the \\'Life of Bolivar Blake\\'; you remember\\nColonel Byrd got it off in a toast at a wedding breakfast, and\\nGreat-grandfather Bolivar was so proud of it he had it carved\\nabove his library door.\"\\n\\n\"High and mighty old chap, wasn\\'t he? But what\\'s the rest?\"\\n\\n\"What he really said was: \\'A Blake can hate twice as long as most\\nmen can love, and love twice as long as most men can live.\\'\"\\n\\nChristopher looked down suddenly at his great bronzed hands. \"Oh,\\nhe needn\\'t have stuck the tail of it on,\" he remarked carelessly;\\n\"but the first part has a bully sound.\"\\n\\nWhen Cynthia had gone, he undressed and threw himself on the bed,\\nbut there was a queer stinging sensation in his veins, and he\\ncould not sleep. Rising presently, he opened the window, and in\\nthe frosty October air stood looking through the darkness to the\\nlight that twinkled in the direction of Blake Hall. Faint stars\\nwere shining overhead, and against the indistinct horizon\\nsomething obscure and black was dimly outlined--perhaps the great\\nclump of oaks that surrounded the old brick walls. Somewhere by\\nthat glimmer of light he knew that Fletcher sat hugging his\\nambition like a miser, gloating over the grandson who would grow\\nup to redeem his name. For the weak, foolish-mouthed boy\\nChristopher at this moment knew neither tolerance nor compassion;\\nand if he stooped to touch him, he felt that it was merely as he\\nwould grasp a stick which Fletcher had taken for his own defense.\\nThe boy himself might live or die, prosper or fail, it made\\nlittle difference. The main thing was that in the end Bill\\nFletcher should be hated by his grandson as he was hated by the\\nman whom he had wronged.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. As the Twig is Bent\\n\\nIt was two weeks after this that Fletcher, looking up from his\\ncoffee and cakes one morning, demanded querulously \"Whar\\'s Will,\\nSaidie? It seems to me he sleeps late these days.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he was up hours ago,\" responded Miss Saidie, from behind the\\nflorid silver service. \"I believe he has gone rabbit hunting with\\nthat young Blake. \"\\n\\nFletcher laid down his knife and fork and glowered suspiciously\\nupon his sister, the syrup from his last mouthful hanging in\\ndrops on his coarse gray beard.\\n\\n\"With young Blake! Why, what\\'s the meaning of that?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only that Will\\'s taken to him, I think. Thar\\'s no harm in\\nthis hunting rabbits that I can see, and it keeps the child out\\nof doors, anyway. Fresh air is what the doctor said he needed,\\nyou know.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like it; I don\\'t like it,\" protested Fletcher; \"those\\nBlakes are as mad as bulldogs, and they\\'ve been so as far back as\\nI can remember. The sooner a stop\\'s put to this thing the better\\nit\\'ll be. How long has it been going on, I wonder?\" \"About ten\\ndays, I believe, and it does seem to give the boy such an\\ninterest. I can\\'t help feeling it\\'s a pity to break it up.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, bother you and your feelings!\" was Fletcher\\'s retort. \"If\\nyou\\'d had the sense you ought to have had, it never would have\\nstarted; but you\\'ve always had a mushy heart, and I ought to have\\nallowed for it, I reckon. Thar\\'re two kind of women in this\\nworld, the mulish and the pulish, an\\' when it comes to a man\\'s\\ntaking his pick between \\'em, the Lord help him. As for that young\\nBlake--well, if I had to choose between him and the devil, I\\'d\\ntake up with the devil mighty fast, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Brother Bill, he saved the child\\'s life!\"\\n\\n\"Well, he didn\\'t do it on purpose; he told me so himself. I tried\\nto settle that fair and square with him, you know, and he had the\\nface to tear my check in half and send it back. Oh, I don\\'t like\\nthis thing, I tell you, and I won\\'t have it. I\\'ve no doubt it\\'s\\nat the bottom of all Will\\'s cutting up about school, too. He was\\nnot well enough to go yesterday, he said, and here he\\'s getting\\nup this morning at daybreak and streaking, heaven knows whar,\\nwith a beggar. You may as well pack his things--I\\'ll ship him off\\nto-morrow if I\\'m alive.\"\\n\\n\"I hope you won\\'t scold him, anyway; he\\'s not strong, you know,\\nand it\\'s good for him to have a little pleasure. I\\'m sure I can\\'t\\nsee what you have against the Blakes, as far as that goes. I\\nremember the old gentleman when I was a child--so fine, and\\nclean, and pleasant, it was a sight just to see him ride by on\\nhis dappled horse. He always lifted his hat to me, too, when he\\npassed me in the road, and once he gave me some peaches for\\nopening the red gate for him. I never could help liking him, and\\nI was sorry when he lost his money and they had to sell the\\nHall.\"\\n\\nFletcher choked over his coffee and grew purple in the face.\\n\\n\"Hang your puling!\" he cried harshly. \"I\\'ll not stand it, do you\\nhear? The old man was a beggarly, cheating spendthrift, and the\\nyoung one is a long sight worse. I\\'d rather wring Will\\'s neck\\nthan have him mixed up with that batch of paupers.\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie shrunk back, frightened, behind the silver service.\\n\\n\"Of course you know best, brother,\" she hastened to acknowledge,\\nwith her unfailing good-humour. \"I\\'m as fond of the child as you\\nare, I reckon--and of Maria, too, for that matter. Have you seen\\nthis photograph she sent me yesterday, taken at some outlandish\\nplace across the water? I declare, I had no idea she was half so\\nhandsome. She has begun to wear her hair low and has filled out\\nconsiderable.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there was room for it,\" commented Fletcher, as he glanced\\nindifferently at the picture and laid it down. \"Get Will\\'s\\nclothes packed to-day, remember. He starts off tomorrow morning,\\nrain or shine.\"\\n\\nPushing back his chair, he paused to gulp a last swallow of\\ncoffee, and then stamped heavily from the room.\\n\\nAt dinner Will did not appear, and when at last the supper bell\\njangled in the hall and Fletcher strode in to find the boy\\'s\\nplace still empty, the shadow upon his brow grew positively\\nblack. As they rose from the table there were brisk, light steps\\nalong the hall, and Will entered hurriedly, warm and dusty after\\nthe day\\'s hunt. Catching sight of his grandfather, he started\\nnervously, and the boyish animation he had brought in from the\\nfields faded quickly from his face, which took on a sly and\\ndogged look.\\n\\n\"Whar in the devil\\'s name have you been, suh?\" demanded Fletcher\\nbluntly.\\n\\nThe boy hesitated, seeking the inevitable defenses of the weak\\npitted against the strong. \"I\\'ve been teaching my hounds to hunt\\nrabbits,\" he replied, after a moment. \"Zebbadee was with me.\"\\n\\n\"So you were too sick to start for school this morning, eh?\"\\npursued Fletcher, hurt and angry. \"Only well enough to go\\ntraipsing through the bushes after a pack of brutes?\"\\n\\n\"I had a headache, but it got better. May I go up now to wash my\\nhands?\"\\n\\nFor an instant Fletcher regarded him in a brooding silence; then,\\nwith that remorseless cruelty which is the strangest\\nmanifestation of wounded love, he loosened upon the boy\\'s head\\nall the violence of his smothered wrath.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll do nothing of the kind! I ain\\'t done with you yet, and\\nwhen I am I reckon you will know it. Mark my words, if you warn\\'t\\nsuch a girlish looking chap I\\'d take my horsewhip to your\\nshoulders in a jiffy. So this is the return I get, is it, for all\\nmy trouble with you since the day you were born! Tricks and lies\\nare all the reward I\\'m to expect, I reckon. Well, you\\'ll learn--\\nonce for all, now--that when you undertake to fool me it\\'s a\\nclear waste of time. I\\'ve found out whar you\\'ve been to-day, and\\nI know you\\'ve been sneaking across the county with that darn\\nBlake!\"\\n\\nThe boy looked at him steadily, first with speechless terror,\\nthen with a cowed and sullen rage. The glare in Fletcher\\'s eyes\\nfascinated him, and he stood motionless on his spot of carpet as\\nif he were held there in an invisible vise. Weakling as he was,\\nhe had been humoured too long to bear the lash submissively at\\nlast, and beneath the tumult of words that overwhelmed him he\\nfelt his anger flow like an infusion of courage in his veins. The\\ngreater share of love was still on his grandfather\\'s side, and\\nthe knowledge of this lent a sullen defiance to his voice.\\n\\n\"You bluster so I can\\'t hear,\" he said, blinking fast to shut out\\nthe other\\'s eyes. \"If I did go with Christopher Blake, what\\'s the\\nharm in it? I only lied because you make such a fuss it gives me\\na headache.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the first fuss I ever made with you, I reckon,\" returned\\nFletcher, softening before the accusation. \"If I ever fussed with\\nyou before, sonny, you may make mighty certain you deserved it.\"\\n\\n\"You frighten me half to death when you rage so,\" persisted the\\nboy, snatching craftily at his advantage.\\n\\n\"There, there, we\\'ll get it over,\" said Fletcher, quieting\\ninstantly. \"I didn\\'t mean to scare you that way, but the truth is\\nit put me in a passion to hear of you mixing up with that scamp\\nBlake. Jest keep clear of him and I\\'ll ask nothing more of you.\\nYou may chase all your rabbits between here and kingdom come for\\naught I care, but if I ever see you alongside of Christopher\\nBlake again, I tell you, I\\'ll lick you until you\\'re black and\\nblue. And now hurry up and git your supper and go to bed, for you\\nstart to school to-morrow morning at sunrise.\"\\n\\nWill flushed, and stood blinking his eyes in the lamplight.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to go to school, grandpa,\" he said persuasively.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a pity, sonny, because you\\'ve got to go whether you like\\nit or not. Your Aunt Saidie has gone and packed your things, and\\nI\\'ll give you a month\\'s pocket money to start with.\"\\n\\n\"But I\\'d rather stay at home and study with Mr. Morrison. Then I\\ncould follow after the hounds in the afternoon and keep out in\\nthe fresh air, as the doctor said I must.\"\\n\\n\"Now, now, we\\'ve had enough of this,\" said Fletcher decisively.\\n\"You\\'ll do what I say, mind you, and you\\'ll do it quick. No\\nhaggling over it, do you hear?\"\\n\\nWill looked at him sullenly, nerved by that reckless anger which\\nso often passes for pure daring.\\n\\n\"If you make me go you\\'ll be sorry, grandpa,\" he said, choking.\\n\\nFletcher swallowed an uneasy laugh, strangled over it, and\\nfinally spat it out with a wad of tobacco.\\n\\n\"Why, what blamed maggot have you got in your head, son?\" he\\ninquired, laying his heavy hand on the boy\\'s shoulder. \"You\\ndidn\\'t use to hate school so, and, as sure as you\\'re born, you\\'ll\\nfind it first rate sport when you get back. It\\'s this Blake\\nbusiness, that\\'s what it is--he\\'s gone and stuffed you plum full\\nof notions. Look here, now, you don\\'t want to grow up to be a\\ndunce like him, do you?\"\\n\\nHe had touched the raw at last, and Will broke out passionately\\nin revolt, inflamed by a boyish admiration for his own bravado.\\n\\n\"He\\'s got a lot more sense than anybody about here, \"he cried,\\nbacking against the door and holding tightly to the handle; \"and\\nif he doesn\\'t know that plaguey Greek it\\'s because he says there\\nisn\\'t any use in it. Why, he can shoot a bird on the wing over\\nhis shoulder, and mount a horse at full gallop, and tell stories\\nthat make you creep all over. He\\'s not a dunce, grandpa; he\\'s my\\nfriend, and I like him!\"\\n\\nThe last words came in a sudden spurt, for, feeling his\\nartificial courage ooze out of him, the boy had started in a run\\nfrom the room. He had barely crossed the threshold, however, when\\nFletcher reached out with a strong grip and pulled him back,\\nswinging him slowly round until the two stood face to face.\\n\\n\"Now, here\\'s one thing flat,\" said the man in a husky voice, if I\\never see or hear of you opening your mouth to that rascal again,\\nI\\'ll thrash you until you haven\\'t a sound bone in your body.\\nYou\\'d better go up now and say your prayers.\"\\n\\nAs he released his grasp, the boy struck out at him with a\\nnerveless gesture and then shot like an arrow through the hall\\nand out into the twilight. At the moment his terror of Fletcher\\nwas forgotten in the paroxysm of his anger. Short sobs broke from\\nhim as he ran, and presently his breath came in pants like those\\nof an overdriven horse; but still, without slackening his pace,\\nhe sped on to the old ice-pond and then wheeled past the turning\\ninto the sunken road. Not until he had reached the long gate\\nbefore the Blake cottage did he stop short suddenly and stand,\\ngrasping his moist shirt collar, in an effort to quiet his\\nconvulsed breathing.\\n\\nThe hounds greeted him with a single bay, and at the noise\\nCynthia came out upon the porch and then down into the gravelled\\npath between the old rose-bushes.\\n\\n\"What do you wish?\" she demanded stiffly, standing severe and\\nerect in her faded silk.\\n\\n\"I must speak to Christopher--I must!\" gasped the boy, breathing\\nhard. \"I am going away tomorrow, and this is my last chance.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s in the stable, I believe,\" replied Cynthia coolly.\\n\"If you want him, you must go there to look for him, and be sure\\nnot to make a noise when you pass the house.\" Then, as he darted\\naway, her eyes followed him with a weary aversion.\\n\\nWill passed the kitchen and the woodpile and, turning into a\\nlittle path that led from the well, came to the open door of the\\nrudely built stable. A dim light fell in a square across the\\nthreshold, and looking inside he saw that a lantern was hanging\\nfrom a nail above the nearest stall and that within the circle of\\nits illumination Christopher was busily currying the old gray\\nmare.\\n\\nAt the boy\\'s entrance he paused for an instant, glanced\\ncarelessly over the side of the stall, and then went on with his\\nwork.\\n\\n\"Playing night-owl, eh?\" he remarked indifferently. \"There\\'s no\\nrubbing-down for you to do, I reckon.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s a darn sight worse,\" returned the boy, throwing out the\\noath with a conscious swagger as he braced himself against the\\nladder that ran up to the loft.\\n\\nHis tone arrested Christopher\\'s hand, and, lifting his head, the\\nyoung man stood attentively regarding him, one arm lying upon the\\nbroad back of the old mare.\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s up now?\" he questioned with a smile. Some fine\\nchaff, which he had brought down from the loft, still clung to\\nhis hair and clothes and darkened his upper lip like a mustache.\\n\\n\"Grandpa\\'s found it out and he\\'s hopping,\" said the boy. \"I\\nalways told you he would be, you know, and now it\\'s come. If he\\never catches me with you again he swears he\\'ll give it to me like\\nhell. He pressed tightly against the ladder and wagged his head\\ndefiantly. \"But he needn\\'t think he can bully me like that--not\\nif I know it!\"\\n\\n\"Well, he mustn\\'t catch you again,\" returned Christopher, not\\ntroubling to soften his scorn of such cheap heroics; \"we must\\nmanage better next time. Did you think to remind him, by the way,\\nthat I once took the trouble to save your life?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a fact, I didn\\'t think of it. What would he have said, I\\nwonder?\"\\n\\nChristopher raised his eyebrows. \"Knocked your front teeth out,\\nperhaps. He\\'s like that, isn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s awfully fond of me, you know,\" protested the boy; \"but\\nit\\'s his meddling ways that I can\\'t stand. What business is it of\\nhis who my friends are? He hasn\\'t got to take up with \\'em, has\\nhe? Why, what he hates is for me to want to be with anybody but\\nhimself or Aunt Saidie. He\\'d like to keep me dangling all day to\\nhis coat tails, but it\\'s not fair, and I won\\'t have it. I\\'ll show\\nhim whether I\\'m to be kept a kid forever or not!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s spirit for you!\" drawled Christopher with a laugh, as he\\napplied the currycomb to the mare\\'s flank.\\n\\n\"You just wait till you hear the worst,\" returned the other, with\\nevident pride in the thunderbolt about to be delivered. \"He\\nswears he\\'s going to send me to school tomorrow at sunrise.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so?\" ejaculated Christopher.\\n\\n\"Oh, but he\\'ll do it, too--the only way to get around him is to\\nfall ill, and I can\\'t work that tomorrow. I played the trick last\\nweek and he saw through it. I\\'ve got to go, that\\'s certain; but\\nI\\'m going to make him sorry enough before he\\'s done. Why couldn\\'t\\nhe let me keep on studying with Mr. Morrison, as the doctor said\\nI ought to? What\\'s the use of this blamed old Latin and Greek,\\nanyway? Nobody about here knows them, and why should I set myself\\nup for a precious numbskull of a scholar? I\\'d rather be a crack\\nshot like you any day! I tell you one thing,\" he finished,\\nsucking in his breath in a way that had annoyed Christopher from\\nthe first, \"I\\'ve half a mind to run away or fall ill after I get\\nthere!\"\\n\\nChristopher turned suddenly, slapped the mare on the flank, and\\ncame out of the stall, the currycomb still in his hand. His shirt\\nsleeves were rolled above his elbows, and the muscles of his arms\\nstood out like cords under the sunburned skin, which showed a\\npaler bronze from the wrists up. He was flushed from leaning\\nover, and his clothes smelled strongly of the stable.\\n\\n\"If you do, come to me, \" he said lightly, \"and I\\'ll hide you in\\nthe barn till the storm blows over. It wouldn\\'t last long, I\\nreckon.\"\\n\\n\"Bless you, no; when he\\'s scared I can do anything with him. Why,\\nhe was as soft as mush after the horses ran away with me, though\\nhe\\'d threatened to thrash me if I touched the reins. Oh, I say\\nit\\'s a shame we never had that \\'possum hunt!\"\\n\\nChristopher turned down his shirt sleeves and brushed the chaff\\nfrom his face.\\n\\n\"What do you say about to-night?\" he inquired, with something\\nlike a sneer. \"We couldn\\'t go far, of course, and we\\'d have to\\nborrow Tom Spade\\'s hounds--mine are tired out--but we might have\\na short run about midnight, get a \\'possum or so, and be in our\\nbeds before daybreak. Shall we try it?\"\\n\\nThe boy wavered, struggling between his desire for the chase and\\nhis fear of Fletcher.\\n\\n\"Of course, if you\\'re afraid--\" added Christopher slowly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid,\" broke out Will angrily. \"I\\'m not afraid and you\\nknow it. You be at the store by eleven, and I\\'ll get out of the\\nwindow and join you. Grandpa will never know, and if he\\ndoes--well, I\\'ll settle him!\"\\n\\n\"Then be quick about it,\" was Christopher\\'s retort, and as the\\nboy ran out into the darkness he followed him to the door and\\nstood gazing moodily down upon the yellow circle that his lantern\\ncast on the bare ground. A massive fatigue oppressed him, and his\\nhands and feet had become like leaden weights. There was a\\nheaviness, too, about his head, and his eyeballs burned as if he\\nhad looked too long at a bright light. At the moment he felt like\\na man who, being bound upon a wheel, is whirled so rapidly around\\nthat he is dazed by the continuous revolutions. What did it all\\nmean, anyway--the boy, Fletcher, himself, and the revenge which\\nhe now saw so clearly before him? Was it a great divine judgment\\nor a great human cruelty?\\n\\nQuestion as he would, the wheel still turned, and he knew that\\nfor good or evil he was bound upon it until the end.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. Powers of Darkness\\n\\nOctober dragged slowly along, and Christopher followed his work\\nupon the farm with the gloomy indifference which had become the\\nsettled expression of his attitude toward life. Since the morning\\nwhen he had seen Will drive by to the cross-roads he had heard\\nnothing of him, and gradually, as the weeks went on, that last\\nreckless night behind the hounds had ceased to represent a cause\\neither of rejoicing or of regret. He had not meant to goad the\\nboy into drinking--of this he was quite sure--and yet when the\\nhunt was over and the two stood just before dawn in Tom Spade\\'s\\nroom he had felt the devil enter into him and take possession.\\nThe old mad humour of his blood ran high, and as the raw whisky\\nfired his imagination he was dimly conscious that his talk grew\\nwilder and that the surrounding objects swam before his gaze as\\nif seen through a fog. Life, for the time at least, lost its\\nrelative values; the moment loomed larger in his vision than the\\nyears, and he beheld the past and the future dwarfed by the\\nsingle radiant instant that was his own. It was as if he could\\npay back the score of a lifetime in that one minute.\\n\\n\"Is it possible that what was so difficult yesterday should have\\ngrown so easy to-day?\" he asked himself, astonished. \"Why have I\\nnever seen so clearly before? Why, until this evening, have I\\ngone puling about my life as if such things as disgrace and\\npoverty were sufficient to crush the strength out of a man? Let\\nme put forth all my courage and nothing is impossible--not even\\nthe attainment of success nor the punishment of Fletcher. It is\\nonly necessary to begin at once--to hasten about one\\'s task--and\\nin a few short years it will be accomplished and done with. All\\nwill be as I wish, and I shall then be as happy as Tucker.\"\\n\\nFollowing this came the questions, How? When? Where shall I\\nbegin?--but he put them angrily aside and refilled his glass. A\\ngreat good-humour possessed him, and, as he drank, all the\\nunpleasant things of life--loss, unrest, heavy labour--vanished\\nin the roseate glow that pervaded his thoughts.\\n\\nWhat came of it was not quite clear to him next day, and this\\ncaused the uneasiness that lasted for a week. He had a vague\\nrecollection that Tom Spade took the boy home and rolled him\\nthrough the window, and that he himself went whistling to his bed\\nwith the glorious sensation that he was riding the crest of a big\\nwave. With the morning came a severe headache and the ineffectual\\neffort to remember just how far it had all gone, and then a sharp\\nanxiety, which vanished when he saw Will pass on his way to\\nschool.\\n\\n\"The boy was none the worse for it,\" Tom Spade told him later;\\n\"he had a drop too much, to be sure, but his legs were as steady\\nas mine, an\\' he slept it off in an hour. He\\'s a ticklish chap,\\nMr. Christopher,\" the storekeeper added after a moment, \"an\\' I\\'d\\nkeep my hands from meddlin\\' with him, if I was you. That thing\\nshan\\'t happen agin at my place, an\\' it wouldn\\'t have happened\\nthen if I\\'d been around at the beginnin\\'. You may tamper with yo\\'\\nown salvation as much as you please--that\\'s my gospel, but I\\'ll\\nbe hanged if you\\'ve got a right to tamper with anybody else\\'s.\"\\n\\nChristopher wheeled suddenly about and gave him a keen glance\\nfrom under his lowered eyelids. For the first time he detected a\\nlack of deference in Tom Spade\\'s tone, and a suspicion shot\\nthrough him that the words were meant to veil a reprimand.\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon the boy\\'s got as good a right to drink as I\\nhave,\" he retorted sneeringly, and a moment afterward went gaily\\nwhistling through the store. At the time he felt a certain\\npleasure in defying Tom\\'s opinion--in setting himself so boldly\\nin opposition to the conventional morality of his neighbours. The\\nsituation gave him several sharp breaths and that dizzy sense of\\ninsecurity in which his mood delighted. It had needed only the\\nshade of disapproval expressed in the storekeeper\\'s voice to lend\\na wonderful piquancy to his enjoyment--to cause him to toy in\\nimagination with his hatred as a man does with his desire. Before\\nTom spoke he had caught himself almost regretting the\\naffair--wondering, even, if his error were past retrieving--but\\nwith the first mere suggestion of outside criticism his humour\\nunderwent a startling change.\\n\\nBetween Fletcher and himself the account was still open, and the\\nway in which he meant to settle it concerned himself alone--least\\nof all did it concern Tom Spade.\\n\\nHe was groping confusedly among these reflections when, one\\nevening in early November, he went upstairs after a hasty supper\\nto find Cynthia already awaiting him in his room. At his start of\\ndispleased surprise she came timidly forward and touched his arm.\\n\\n\"Are you sick, Christopher? or has anything happened? You are so\\nunlike yourself.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head impatiently and her hand fell from his sleeve.\\nIt occurred to him all at once, with an aggrieved irritation,\\nthat of late his family had failed him in sympathy--that they had\\nceased to value the daily sacrifices he made. Almost with horror\\nhe found himself asking the next instant whether the simple bond\\nof blood was worth all that he had given--worth his youth, his\\nmanhood, his ambition? Until this moment his course had seemed to\\nhim the one inevitable outcome of circumstances--the one\\nappointed path for him to tread; but even as he put the question\\nhe saw in a sudden illumination that there might have been\\nanother way--that with the burden of the three women removed he\\nmight have struck out into the world and at least have kept his\\nown head above water. With his next breath the horror of his\\nthought held him speechless, and he turned away lest Cynthia\\nshould read his degradation in his eyes.\\n\\n\"Happened! Why, what should have happened?\" he inquired with\\nattempted lightness. \"Good Lord! After a day\\'s work like mine you\\ncan hardly expect me to dance a hornpipe. Since sunrise I\\'ve done\\na turn at fall ploughing, felled and chopped a tree, mended the\\npasture fence, brought the water for the washing, tied up some\\ntobacco leaves, and looked after the cattle and the horses--and\\nnow you find fault because I haven\\'t cut any extra capers!\"\\n\\n\"Not find fault, dear,\" she answered, and the hopeless courage in\\nher face smote him to the heart. In a bitter revulsion of feeling\\nhe felt that he could not endure her suffering tenderness.\\n\\n\"Find fault with you! Oh, Christopher! It is only that you have\\nbeen so different of late, so brooding, and you seem to avoid us\\nat every instant. Even mother has noticed it, and she imagines\\nthat you are in love.\"\\n\\n\"In love!\" he threw back his head with a loud laugh. \"Oh, I\\'m\\ntired, Cynthia--dog-tired, that\\'s the matter.\"\\n\\n\"I know, I know,\" replied Cynthia, rubbing her eyes hard with the\\nback of her hand. \"And the worst is that there\\'s no help for\\nit--absolutely none. I think about it sometimes until I wonder\\nthat I don\\'t go mad.\"\\n\\nHe turned at this from the window through which he had been\\ngazing and fixed upon her a perplexed and moody stare. The\\nwistful patience in her face, like the look he had seen in the\\neyes of overworked farm animals, aroused in him a desire to prod\\nher into actual revolt--into any decisive rebellion against fate.\\nTo accept life upon its own terms seemed to him, at the instant,\\npure cowardliness--the enforced submission of a weakened will;\\nand he questioned almost angrily if the hereditary instincts were\\nalive in her also? Did she, too, have her secret battles and her\\nsilent capitulations? Or was her pious resignation, after all,\\nonly a new form of the old Blake malady--of that fatal apathy\\nwhich seized them, like disease, when events demanded strenuous\\nendeavour? Could the saintly fortitude he had once so envied be,\\nwhen all was said, merely the outward expression of the inertia\\nhe himself had felt--of the impulse to drift with the tide, let\\nit carry one where it would?\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad it\\'s no worse,\" said Cynthia, with a sigh of\\nrelief, as she turned toward the door. \"Since you are not sick,\\ndear, things are not so bad as they might be. I\\'ll let mother\\nfancy you have what she calls \\'a secret sentiment.\\' It amuses\\nher, at any rate. And now I\\'m going to stir up some buckwheat\\ncakes for your breakfast. We\\'ve got a jug of black molasses.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s pleasant, at least,\" he returned, laughing; and then as\\nshe reached the door he went toward her and laid his hand\\nawkwardly upon her shoulder. \"Don\\'t worry about me, Cynthia,\" he\\nadded; \"there\\'s a lot of work left in me yet, and a change for\\nthe better may come any day, you know. By next year the price of\\ntobacco may shoot skyhigh.\"\\n\\nHer face brightened and a flush smoothed out all the fine\\nwrinkles on her brow, but with the pathetic shyness of a woman\\nwho has never been caressed she let his hand fall stiffly from\\nher arm and went hurriedly from the room.\\n\\nFor a few minutes Christopher stood looking abstractedly at the\\nclosed door. Then shaking his head, as if to rid himself of an\\naccusing thought, he turned away and began rapidly to undress. He\\nhad thrown off his coat, and was stooping to remove his boots,\\nwhen a slight noise at the window startled him, and straightening\\nhimself instantly he awaited attentively a repetition of the\\nsound. In a moment it came again, and hastily crossing the room\\nand raising the sash, he looked out into the full moonlight and\\nsaw Will Fletcher standing in the gravelled path below. At the\\nfirst glance surprise held him motionless, but as the boy waved\\nto him he responded to the signal, and, catching up his coat from\\nthe bed, ran down the staircase and out into the yard.\\n\\n\"What in the devil\\'s name--\" he exclaimed, aghast.\\n\\nWill was trembling from exhaustion, and his face glimmered like a\\npallid blotch under the shadow of the aspen. When the turkeys\\nstirred on an overhanging bough above him he started nervously\\nand sucked in his breath with a hissing sound. He was run to\\ndeath; this Christopher saw at the first anxious look.\\n\\n\"Get me something to eat,\" said the boy; \"I\\'m half starved--but\\nbring it to the barn, for I\\'m too dead tired to stand a moment.\\nYes, I ran away, of course,\" he finished irritably. \"Do I look as\\nif I\\'d come in grandpa\\'s carriage?\"\\n\\nWith a last spurt of energy he disappeared into the shadows\\nbehind the house, and Christopher, going into the kitchen, began\\nsearching the tin safe for the chance remains of supper. On the\\ntable was the bowl of buckwheat which Cynthia had been preparing\\nwhen she was called away by some imperious demand of her\\nmother\\'s, and near it he saw the open prayer-book from which she\\nhad been reading. From the adjoining room he heard Tucker\\'s\\nvoice--those rich, pleasant tones that translated into sound the\\ncourageous manliness of the old soldier\\'s face--and for an\\ninstant he yearned toward the cheerful group sitting in the\\nfirelight beyond the whitewashed wall--toward the blind woman in\\nher old oak chair, listening to the evening chapter from the\\nScriptures. Then the feeling passed as quickly as it had come,\\nand securing a plate of bread and a dried ham-bone, he filled a\\nglass with fresh milk, and, picking up his lantern, went out of\\ndoors and along the little straggling path to the barn.\\n\\nThe yard was frosted over with moonlight, but when he reached the\\nrude building where the farm implements and cattle fodder were\\nsheltered he saw that it was quite dark inside, only a few\\nscattered moonbeams crawling through the narrow doorway. To his\\nfirst call there was no answer, and it was only after he had\\nlighted his lantern and swung it round in the darkness that he\\ndiscovered Will lying fast asleep upon a pile of straw.\\n\\nAs the light struck him full in the face the boy opened his eyes\\nand sprang up.\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s you,\" he said in a relieved voice. \"I thought it was\\ngrandpa. If he comes you\\'ve got to keep him out, you know!\"\\n\\nHe spoke in an excited whisper, and his eyes plunged beyond the\\nentrance with a look of pitiable and abject terror. Once or twice\\nhe shivered as if from cold, and then, turning away, cowered into\\nthe pile of straw in search of warmth.\\n\\nFor a time Christopher stood gazing uneasily down upon him. \"Look\\nhere, man, this can\\'t keep up,\" he said. \"You\\'d better go\\nstraight home, that\\'s my opinion, and get into a decent bed.\"\\n\\nWill started up again. \"I won\\'t see him! I won\\'t!\" he cried\\nangrily. \"If you bring him here I\\'ll get up and hide. I won\\'t see\\nhim! Why, he almost killed me after that \\'possum hunt we had, and\\nif he found this out so soon he\\'d kill me outright. There was an\\nawful rumpus at school. They wrote him and he said he was coming,\\nso I ran away. It was all his fault, too; he had no business to\\nsend me back again when he knew how I hated it. I told him he\\'d\\nbe sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he shan\\'t get in here to-night,\" returned Christopher\\nsoothingly. I\\'ll keep him out with a shotgun, bless him, if he\\nshows his face. Come, now, sit up and eat a bit, or there won\\'t\\nbe any fight left in us.\"\\n\\nWill took the food obediently, but before it touched his lips the\\nhand in which he held it dropped limply to the straw.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t eat,\" he complained, with a gesture of disgust. \"I\\'m too\\nsick--I\\'ve been sick for days. It was all grandpa\\'s doing, too.\\nWhen I heard he was coming I went out and got soaking wet, and\\nthen slept in my clothes all night. I knew he\\'d never make a fuss\\nif I could only get ill enough, but the next morning I felt all\\nright, so I came away.\"\\n\\nKneeling upon the floor, Christopher held the glass to his lips,\\ngently forcing him to drink a few swallows. Then dipping his\\nhandkerchief in the cattle trough outside, he bathed the boy\\'s\\nface and hands, and, loosening his clothes, made him as\\ncomfortable as he could. \"This won\\'t do, you know,\" he urged\\npresently, alarmed by Will\\'s difficult breathing. \"You are in for\\na jolly little spell, and I must get you home. Your grandfather\\nwill never bother you while you\\'re sick.\"\\n\\nAt the words the boy clung to him deliriously, breaking into\\nfrightened whimpers such as a child makes in the dark. \"I won\\'t\\ngo back! I won\\'t go back!\" he repeated wildly; \"he\\'ll never\\nbelieve I\\'m ill, and I won\\'t go back!\"\\n\\n\"All right; that settles it. Lie quiet and I\\'ll fetch you some\\nbedding from my room. Then I\\'ll fix you a pallet out here, and\\nwe\\'ll put up as best we can till morning.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t stay; don\\'t stay,\" pleaded Will, as the other, leaving his\\nlantern on the floor, ran out into the moonlight.\\n\\nReturning in a quarter of an hour, he threw a small feather-bed\\ndown upon the straw and settled the boy comfortably upon it. Then\\nhe covered him with blankets, and, after closing the door, came\\nback and stood watching for him to fall asleep. A slight draft\\nblew from the boarded window, and, taking off his coat, he hung\\nit carefully across the cracks, shading the lantern with his hand\\nthat its light might not flash in the sleeper\\'s face.\\n\\nAt his step Will gave a stifled moan and looked up in terror.\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d left me. Don\\'t go,\" he begged, stretching out\\nhis hand until it grasped the other\\'s. With the hot, nerveless\\nclutch upon him, Christopher was conscious of a quick repulsion,\\nand he remembered the sensation he had felt as a boy when he had\\nonce suddenly brought his palm down on a little green snake that\\nwas basking in the sunshine on an old log. Yet he did not shake\\nthe hand off, and when presently the blanket slipped from Will\\'s\\nshoulders he stooped and replaced it with a strange gentleness.\\nThe disgust he felt was so evenly mingled with compassion that,\\nas he stood there, he could not divide the one emotion from the\\nother. He hated the boy\\'s touch, and yet, almost in spite of\\nhimself, he suffered it.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not going, so you needn\\'t let that worry you,\" he\\nreplied. \"I\\'ll stretch myself alongside of you in the straw, and\\nif you happen to want me, just yell out, you know.\"\\n\\nThe weak fingers closed tightly about his wrist.\\n\\n\"You promise?\" asked the boy.\\n\\n\"Oh, I promise,\" answered the other, raising the lantern for a\\nlast look before he blew it out.\\n\\nBy early daybreak Will\\'s condition was still more alarming, and\\nleaving him in a feverish stupor upon the pallet, Christopher set\\nout hurriedly shortly after sunrise to carry news of the boy\\'s\\nwhereabouts to Fletcher.\\n\\nIt was a clear, cold morning, and the old brick house, set midway\\nof the autumn fields, appeared, as he approached it, to reflect\\nthe golden light that filled the east. Never had the place seemed\\nto him more desirable than it did as he went slowly toward it\\nalong the desolate November roads. The somber colours of the\\nlandscape, the bared majesty of the old oaks where a few leaves\\nstill clung to the topmost boughs, the deserted garden filled\\nwith wan specters of summer flowers, were all in peculiar harmony\\nwith his own mood as with the stern gray walls wrapped in naked\\ncreepers. That peculiar sense of ownership was strongly with him\\nas he ascended the broad steps and lifted the old brass knocker,\\nwhich still bore the Blake coat of arms.\\n\\nTo his astonishment the door opened instantly and Fletcher\\nhimself appeared upon the threshold. At sight of Christopher he\\nfell back as if from a blow in the chest, ripping out an oath\\nwith a big downward gesture of his closed fist.\\n\\n\"So you are mixed up in it, are you! Whar\\'s the boy?\" From the\\ndusk of the hall his face shone dead white about the eyes.\\n\\n\"If you want to get anything out of me you\\'d better curb your\\ntongue, Bill Fletcher,\" replied Christopher coolly, feeling an\\nanimal instinct to prolong the torture. \"If you think it\\'s any\\nsatisfaction to me to have your young idiot thrown on my hands\\nyou were never more mistaken in your life. I\\'ve been up half the\\nnight with him, and the sooner you take him away the better I\\'ll\\nlike it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you leave him to me and I\\'ll settle him,\" responded\\nFletcher, reaching for his hat. \"Jest show me whar he is and I\\'ll\\ngit even with him befo\\' sundown. As for you, young man, I\\'ll have\\nthe sheriff after you yit.\"\\n\\n\"In the meantime, you\\'d better have the doctor. The boy\\'s ill, I\\ntell you. He came to me last evening, run to death and with a\\nhigh fever. He slept in the barn, and this morning he is\\ndecidedly worse. If you come, bring Doctor Cairn with you, and I\\nwarn you now you\\'ve got to use a lot of caution. Your grandson is\\nmortally afraid of you, and he threatens to run away if I let you\\nknow where he is. He wants me to sit at the door with a shotgun\\nand keep you off.\"\\n\\nHe delivered his blows straight out from the shoulder, lingering\\nover each separate word that he might enjoy to the full its\\nstupendous effect.\\n\\n\"This is your doing,\" repeated Fletcher hoarsely; \"it\\'s your\\ndoing, every blamed bit of it.\"\\n\\nChristopher laughed shortly. \"Well, I\\'m through with my errand,\"\\nhe said, moving toward the steps and pausing with one hand on a\\ngreat white column. \"The sooner you get him out of my barn the\\nbetter riddance it will be. There\\'s one thing certain, though,\\nand that is that you don\\'t lay eyes on him without the doctor.\\nHe\\'s downright ill, on my oath.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s the same old trick, and I see through it,\" exclaimed\\nFletcher furiously. \"It\\'s pure shamming.\"\\n\\n\"All the same, I\\'ve got my gun on hand, and you don\\'t go into\\nthat barn alone.\" He hung for an instant upon the topmost step,\\nthen descended hurriedly and walked rapidly back along the broad\\nwhite walk. It would be an hour, at least, before Fletcher could\\nfollow him with Doctor Cairn, and after he had returned to the\\nbarn and given Will a glass of new milk he fed and watered the\\nhorses and did the numberless small tasks about the house. He was\\nat the woodpile, chopping some light wood splinters for Cynthia,\\nwhen the sound of wheels reached him, and in a little while more\\nthe head of Fletcher\\'s mare appeared around the porch. Doctor\\nCairn, a frousy, white-bearded old man, crippled from rheumatism,\\nheld out his hand to Christopher as he descended with some\\ndifficulty between the wheels of the buggy.\\n\\nChristopher motioned to the barn, and then, taking the reins,\\nfastened the horse to the branch of a young ailanthus tree which\\ngrew near the woodpile. As he watched the figures of the two men\\npass along the little path between the fringes of dead yarrow he\\ndrew an uneasy breath and dug his boot into the rotting mould\\nupon the ground. The barn door opened and closed; there was a\\nshort silence, and then a sudden despairing cry as of a rabbit\\ncaught in the jaws of a hound. When he heard it he turned\\nimpulsively from the horse\\'s head and went quickly along the path\\nthe men had taken. There was no definite intention in his mind,\\nbut as he reached the barn door it shot open and Fletcher put out\\na white face.\\n\\n\"The Doctor wants you, Mr. Christopher,\" he cried; \"Will has gone\\nclean mad!\"\\n\\nWithout a word, Christopher pushed by him and went into the great\\ndusky room, where the boy was struggling like a madman to loosen\\nthe doctor\\'s grasp. He was conscious at the moment that the air\\nwas filled with fine chaff and that he sucked it in when he\\nbreathed.\\n\\nAt his entrance Will lay quiet for a moment and looked at him\\nwith dazed, questioning eyes.\\n\\n\"Keep them out, Christopher!\" he cried, in anguish.\\n\\nChristopher crossed the room and laid his hand with a protecting\\ngesture on the boy\\'s head.\\n\\n\"Why, to be sure I will,\" he said heartily; \"the devil himself\\nwon\\'t dare to touch you when I am by, \"\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK III\\n\\nTHE REVENGE\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I. In Which Tobacco is Hero\\n\\nOn an October afternoon some four years later, at the season of\\nthe year when the whole county was fragrant with the curing\\ntobacco, Christopher Blake passed along the stretch of old road\\nwhich divided his farm from the Weatherbys\\', and, without\\nentering the porch, called for Jim from the little walk before\\nthe flat whitewashed steps. In response to his voice, Mrs.\\nWeatherby, a large, motherly looking woman, appeared upon the\\nthreshold, and after chatting a moment, directed him to the log\\ntobacco barn, where the recently cut crop was \"drying out.\"\\n\\n\"Jim and Jacob are both over thar,\" she said; \" an\\' a few others,\\nfor the matter of that, who have been helpin\\' us press new cider\\nan\\' drinkin\\' the old. I\\'m sure I don\\'t see why they want to\\nlounge out thar in all that smoke, but thar\\'s no accountin\\' for\\nthe taste of a man that ever I heard tell of an\\' I reckon they\\nkin fancy pretty easy that they are settin\\' plum in the bowl of a\\npipe. It beats me, though, that it do. Why, one mouthful of it is\\nenough to start me coughin\\' for a week, an\\' those men thar jest\\nswallow it down for pure pleasure.\" Clean, kindly, hospitable,\\nshe wandered garrulously on, remembering at intervals to press\\nthe young man to \"come inside an\\' try the cakes an\\' cider.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll look them up out there,\" said Christopher, resisting\\nthe invitation to enter. \"I want to get a pair of horseshoes from\\nJim; the gray mare cast hers yesterday, and Dick Boxley is laid\\nup with a sprained arm. Oh, no, thanks; I must be going back.\"\\nWith a friendly nod he turned from the steps and went rapidly\\nalong the path which led to the distant barn.\\n\\nAs Mrs. Weatherby had said, the place was like the bowl of a\\npipe, and it was a moment before Christopher discovered the\\nlittle group gathered about the doorway, where a shutter hung\\nloosely on wooden hinges.\\n\\nThe ancient custom of curing tobacco with open fires, which had\\npersisted in Virginia since the days of the early settlers, was\\nstill commonly in use; and it is possible that had one of\\nChristopher\\'s colonial ancestors appeared at the moment in Jacob\\nWeatherby\\'s log barn it would have been difficult to convince him\\nthat between his death and his resurrection there was a lapse of\\nmore than two hundred years. He would have found the same square,\\npen-like structure, built of straight logs carefully notched at\\nthe corners; the same tier-poles rising at intervals of three\\nfeet to the roof; the same hewn plates to support the rafters;\\nthe same \"daubing\" of the chinks with red clay; and the same\\ncrude door cut in the south wall. From the roof the tobacco hung\\nin a fantastic decoration, shading from dull green to deep\\nbronze, and appearing, when viewed from the ground below, to\\nresemble a numberless array of small furled flags. On the hard\\nearth floor there were three parallel rows of \"unseasoned\" logs\\nwhich burned slowly day and night, filling the barn with gray\\nsmoke and the pungent odour of the curing tobacco.\\n\\n\"It takes a heap of lookin\\' arter, an\\' no mistake,\" old Jacob was\\nremarking, as he surveyed the fine crop with the bland and easy\\ngaze of ownership. \"Why, in a little while them top leaves thar\\nwill be like tinder, an\\' the first floatin\\' spark will set it all\\nafire. That\\'s the way Sol Peterkin lost half a crop last year,\\nan\\' it\\'s the way Dick Moss lost his whole one the year before.\"\\nAt Christopher\\'s entrance he paused and turned his pleasant,\\nruddy face from the fresh logs which he had been watching. \"So\\nyou want to have a look at my tobaccy, too?\" he added, with the\\nhealthful zest of a child. \"Well, it\\'s worth seein\\', if I do say\\nso; thar hasn\\'t been sech leaves raised in this county within the\\nmemory of man.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Christopher, with an appreciative glance. \"I\\'m\\nlooking for Jim, but he\\'s keeping up the fires, isn\\'t he?\" Then\\nhe turned quickly, for Tom Spade, who with young Matthew Field\\nhad been critically weighing the promise of Jacob\\'s crop, broke\\nout suddenly into a boisterous laugh.\\n\\n\"Why, I declar\\', Mr. Christopher, if you ain\\'t lost yo\\' shadow!\"\\nhe exclaimed.\\n\\nChristopher regarded him blankly for a moment, and then joined\\nlightly in the general mirth. \"Oh, you mean Will Fletcher,\" he\\nreturned. \"There was a pretty girl in the road as we came up, and\\nI couldn\\'t get him a step beyond her. Heaven knows what\\'s become\\nof him by now!\"\\n\\n\"I bet my right hand that was Molly Peterkin,\" said Tom. \"If\\nanybody in these parts begins to talk about \\'a pretty gal,\\' you\\nmay be sartain he\\'s meanin\\' that yaller-headed limb of Satan.\\nWhy, I stopped my Jinnie goin\\' with her a year ago. Sech women, I\\nsaid to her, are fit for nobody but men to keep company with.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so; that\\'s so,\" agreed old Jacob, in a charitable tone;\\n\"seein\\' as men have most likely made \\'em what they are, an\\'\\noughtn\\'t to be ashamed of thar own handiwork.\"\\n\\n\"Now, when it comes to yaller hair an\\' blue eyes,\" put in Matthew\\nField, \"she kin hold her own agin any wedded wife that ever made\\na man regret the day of his birth. Many\\'s the time of late I\\'ve\\ngone a good half-mile to git out of that gal\\'s way, jest as I\\nused to cut round old Fletcher\\'s pasture when I was a boy to keep\\nfrom passin\\' by his redheart cherry-tree that overhung the road.\\nWell, well, they do say that her young man, Fred Turner, went\\nback on her, an\\' threw her on her father\\'s hands two days befo\\'\\nthe weddin\\'.\"\\n\\n\"It was hard on Sol, now you come to think of it,\" said Tom. \"He\\ntold me himself that he tried to git the three who ought to marry\\nher to draw straws for the one who was to be the happy man, but\\nthey all backed out an\\' left her high an\\' dry an\\' as pretty as a\\npeach. Fred Turner would have taken his chance, he said, like an\\nhonest man, an\\' he was terrible down in the mouth when I saw him,\\nfor he was near daft over the gal.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he was right,\" admitted Matthew, after reflection. \"Why,\\nthe gal sins so free an\\' easy you might almost fancy her a man.\"\\n\\nHe drew back, coughing, for Jim came in with a long green log and\\nlaid it on the smouldering fire, which glowed crimson under the\\nheavy smoke.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s Sol,\" said the young man, settling the log with his foot.\\n\"I told him you were on your way to the house, pa, but he said he\\nhad only a minute, so he came out here.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve jest been to borrow some Jamaica ginger from Mrs.\\nWeatherby,\" explained Sol Peterkin, carefully closing the shutter\\nafter his entrance.\\n\\n\"My wife\\'s took so bad that I\\'m beginnin\\' to fear she\\'ll turn out\\nas po\\' a bargain as the last. It\\'s my luck--I always knew I was\\nill-fated--but, Lord a-mercy, how\\'s a man goin\\' to tell the state\\nof a woman\\'s innards from the way she looks on top? All the\\nhuggin\\' in the world won\\'t make her wink an eyelash, an\\' then\\nthere\\'ll crop out heart disease or dropsy befo\\' the year is up.\\nWhen I think of the trouble I had pickin\\' that thar woman it\\nmakes me downright sick. It ain\\'t much matter about the colour or\\nthe shape, I said--a freckled face an\\' a scrawny waist I kin\\nstand--only let it be the quality that wears. If you believe it,\\nsuh, I chose the very ugliest I could find, thinkin\\' that the\\nLord might be mo\\' willin\\' to overlook her--an\\' now this is what\\'s\\ncome of it. She\\'s my fourth, too, an\\' I\\'ll begin to be a joke\\nwhen I go out lookin\\' for a fifth. Naw, suh; if Mary dies, pure\\nshame will keep me a widower to my death.\"\\n\\n\"Thar ain\\'t but one thing sartain about marriage, in my mind,\"\\ncommented Matthew Field, \"an\\' that is that it gits most of its\\ncolour from the distance that comes between. The more your mouth\\nwaters for a woman, the likelier \\'tis that \\'tain\\'t the woman for\\nyou--that\\'s my way of thinkin\\'. The woman a man don\\'t git somehow\\nis always the woman he ought to have had. It\\'s a curious,\\nmixed-up business, however you look at it.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so,\" said Tom Spade; \"I always noticed it. The woman who\\nis your wife may be a bouncin\\' beauty, an\\' the woman who ain\\'t\\nmay be as ugly as sin, but you\\'d go twice as far to kiss her all\\nthe same. Thar is always a sight more spice about the woman who\\nain\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"Jest look at Eliza, now,\" pursued Matthew, wrapped in the\\nthought of his own domestic infelicities. \"What I could never\\nunderstand about Eliza was that John Sales went clean to the dogs\\nbecause he couldn\\'t git her. To think of sech a thing happenin\\',\\njest as if I was to blame, when if I\\'d only known it I could hev\\nturned about an\\' taken her sister Lizzie. Thar were five of \\'em\\nin all, an\\' I settled on Eliza, as it was, with my eyes\\nblindfold. Poor John--poor John! It was sech a terrible waste of\\nwantin\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a thing to stiddy about,\" said old Jacob, with a\\nsigh. \"They tell me now that that po\\' young gal of Bill\\nFletcher\\'s has found it a thorny bed, to be sho\\'. Her letters are\\nall bright an\\' pleasant enough, they say, filled with fine\\nclothes an\\' the names of strange places, but a gentleman who met\\nher somewhar over thar wrote Fletcher that her husband used her\\nlike a dumb brute.\"\\n\\nChristopher started and looked up inquiringly.\\n\\n\"Have you heard anything about that, Jim?\" he asked in a queer\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"Nothin\\' more. Fletcher told me he had written to her to come\\nhome, but she answered that she would stick to Wyndham for better\\nor for worse. It\\'s a great pity--the marriage promised so well,\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the gal\\'s got a big heart; I could tell it from her eyes,\"\\nsaid old Jacob. \"When you see those dark, solemn eyes, lookin\\'\\nout of a pale, peaked face, it means thar\\'s a heart behind \\'em,\\nan\\' a heart that bodes trouble some day, whether it be in man or\\nwoman.\"\\n\\nChristopher passed his hand across his brow and stood staring\\nvacantly at the smouldering logs. He could not tell whether the\\nnews saddened or rejoiced him, but, at least, it brought Maria\\'s\\nimage vividly before his eyes. The spell of her presence was over\\nhim again, and he felt, as he had felt on that last evening, the\\nmysterious attraction of her womanhood. So intense was the\\nvisionary appeal that it had for the moment almost the effect of\\nhallucination; it was as if she still entreated him across all\\nthe distance. The brooding habit of his mind had undoubtedly done\\nmuch to conserve his emotion, as had the rural isolation in which\\nhe lived. In a city life the four years would probably have\\nblotted out her memory; but where comparison was impossible, and\\nlighter distractions almost unheard of, what chance was there for\\nhim to forget the single passionate experience he had known?\\nAmong his primitive neighbours Maria had flitted for a time like\\na bewildering vision; then the great distant world had caught her\\nup into its brightness, and the desolate waste country was become\\nthe guardian of the impression she had left.\\n\\n\"If thar\\'s a man who has had bad luck with his children, it\\'s\\nBill Fletcher,\" old Jacob was saying thoughtfully. \"He\\'s been a\\nhard man an\\' a mean one, too, an\\' when he couldn\\'t beg or borrow\\nit\\'s my opinion that he never hesitated to put forth his hand an\\'\\nsteal. Thar\\'s a powerful lot of judgment in dumb happenin\\'s, an\\'\\nwhen you see a family waste out an\\' run to seed like that it\\nusually means that the good Lord is havin\\' His way about matters.\\nIt takes a mighty sharp eye to tell the difference between\\njudgment an\\' misfortune, an\\' I\\'ve seen enough in this world to\\nknow that, no matter how skilfully you twist up good an\\' evil,\\nGod Almighty may be a long time in the unravelling, but He\\'ll\\nstraighten \\'em out at last. Now as to Bill Fletcher, his sins got\\nin the bone an\\' they\\'re workin\\' out in the blood. Look at his son\\nBill--didn\\'t he come out of the army to drink himself to death?\\nThen his granddaughter Maria has gone an\\' mismarried a somebody,\\nan\\' this boy that he\\'d set his heart on is goin\\' to the devil so\\nprecious fast that he ain\\'t got time to look behind him.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s young yet,\" suggested Tom Spade, solemnly wagging his\\nhead, \"an\\' Fletcher says, you know, that he\\'s all right so long\\nas he keeps clear of Mr. Christopher. It\\'s Mr. Christopher, he\\nswears, that\\'s been the ruin of him.\"\\n\\nChristopher met this with a sneer. \"Why does he let him dog my\\nfootsteps, then?\" he inquired with a laugh. \"I never go to the\\nHall, and yet he\\'s always after me.\"\\n\\n\"Bless you, suh, it ain\\'t any question of lettin\\' an\\' thar never\\nhas been sence the boy first put on breeches. Why, when I refused\\nto sell him whisky at my sto\\', what did he do but begin smugglin\\'\\nit out from town! Fletcher found it out an\\' blew him sky-high,\\nbut in less than a month it was all goin\\' on agin.\"\\n\\n\"An\\' the funny part is,\" said Jim Weatherby, \"that you can\\'t\\ndislike Will Fletcher, however much you try. He\\'s a kindhearted,\\njolly fellow, in spite of the devil.\"\\n\\n\"Or in spite of Mr. Christopher,\" added Tom, with a guffaw.\\n\\nFrowning heavily, Christopher turned toward the door.\\n\\n\"Oh, you ask Will Fletcher who is his best friend,\" he said, \"and\\nlet me hear his answer.\"\\n\\nWith an abrupt nod to Jacob, he went out of the tobacco barn and\\nalong the little path to the road. He had barely reached the\\ngate, however, when Jim Weatherby ran after him with the\\nhorseshoes, and offered eagerly to come over in the morning and\\nsee that the gray mare was properly shod.\\n\\n\"I\\'m handy at that kind of thing, you know,\" he explained, with a\\nblush.\\n\\n\"Well, if you don\\'t mind, I wish you would come,\" Christopher\\nreplied, \"but to save my life I can\\'t see why you are so ready\\nwith other people\\'s jobs.\"\\n\\nThen, taking the horseshoes, he opened the gate and started\\nrapidly toward home. His mind was still absorbed by old Jacob\\'s\\nnews, and upon reaching the house he was about to pass up to his\\nroom, when Cynthia called him from the little platform beyond the\\nback door, and going out, he found her standing pale and tearful\\non the kitchen threshold. Looking beyond her, he saw that Lila\\nand Tucker were in the room, and from the intense and resolute\\nexpression in the younger sister\\'s face he judged that she was\\nthe central figure in what appeared to be a disturbing scene.\\n\\n\"Christopher, you can\\'t imagine what has happened,\" Cynthia began\\nin her beautiful, tragic voice. \"Lila went to church yesterday--\\nwith whom, do you suppose?\"\\n\\nChristopher thought for a moment.\\n\\n\"Not with Bill Fletcher?\" he gave out at last.\\n\\n\"Come, come, now, it\\'s a long ways better than that, you\\'ll\\nadmit, Cynthia,\" broke in Tucker, with a peaceful intention. \"I\\ncan\\'t help reminding you, my dear, to be thankful that it wasn\\'t\\nso unlikely a person as Bill Fletcher.\"\\n\\nWith a decisive gesture such as he had never believed her capable\\nof, Lila came up to Christopher and stood facing him with beaming\\neyes. He had never before seen her so lovely, and he realised at\\nthe instant that it was this she had always needed to complete\\nher beauty. From something merely white and warm and delicate she\\nhad become suddenly as radiant as a flame.\\n\\n\"I went with Jim Weatherby, Christopher,\" she said slowly, \"and\\nI\\'m not ashamed of it.\"\\n\\nThe admission wrung a short groan from Cynthia, who stood\\ntwisting her gingham apron tightly about her fingers.\\n\\n\"Oh, Lila, who was his grandfather?\" she cried. \"Well, there\\'s\\nthis thing certain, she doesn\\'t want to marry his grandfather,\"\\nput in Tucker, undaunted by the failure of his former attempts at\\npeace-making. \"Not that I have anything against the old chap, for\\nthat matter; he was an honest, well-behaved old body, and used to\\nmend my boots for me up to the day of his death. Jim gets his\\nhandy ways from him, I reckon.\"\\n\\nCynthia turned upon him angrily.\\n\\n\"Uncle Tucker, you will drive me mad,\" she exclaimed, the tears\\nstarting to her lashes. \"It does seem to me that you, at least,\\nmight show some consideration for the family name. It\\'s all we\\'ve\\nleft.\"\\n\\n\"And it\\'s a good enough relic in its way,\" returned Tucker\\namicably, \"though if you are going to make a business of\\nsacrificing yourself, for heaven\\'s sake let it be for something\\nbigger than a relic. A live neighbour is a much better thing to\\nmake sacrifices for than a dead grandfather.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care one bit what his grandfather was or whether he ever\\nhad any or not!\" cried Lila, in an outburst of indignation; \"and\\nmore than that, I don\\'t care what mine was, either. I am going to\\nmarry him--I am--I am! Don\\'t look at me like that, Cynthia. Do\\nyou want to spoil my whole life?\"\\n\\nCynthia threw out her hands with a despairing grasp of the air,\\nas if she were reaching for the broken remnants of the family\\npride. \"To marry a Weatherby!\" she gasped. \"Oh, mother! mother!\\nLila, is it possible that you can be so selfish?\" But Lila had\\nwon her freedom too dearly to surrender it to an appeal.\\n\\n\"I want to be selfish,\" she said stubbornly. \"I have never been\\nselfish in my life, and I want to see what it feels like. Oh, you\\nare cruel, all of you, and you will break my heart.\"\\n\\nChristopher\\'s face paled and grew stern.\\n\\n\"We must all think of mother\\'s wishes, Lila,\" he said gravely.\\n\\nFor the first time the girl lost her high fortitude, and a\\nbabyish quiver shook her lips. Her glance wavered and fell, and\\nwith a pathetic gesture she turned from Christopher to Cynthia\\nand from Cynthia to Tucker.\\n\\n\"Oh, you can\\'t understand, Christopher!\" she cried; \"you have\\nnever been in love, nor has Cynthia. None of you can understand\\nbut Uncle Tucker!\"\\n\\nShe ran to him sobbing, and he, steadying himself on a single\\ncrutch, folded his arm about her.\\n\\n\"I understand, child, thank God,\" he said softly.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. Between Christopher and Will\\n\\nAn hour later Christopher was at work in the stable, when he\\nheard a careless whistle outside, and Will Fletcher looked in at\\nthe open door.\\n\\n\"I say, Chris, take a turn off and come down to Tom Spade\\'s,\" he\\nurged.\\n\\nChristopher, who was descending from the loft with an armful of\\nstraw, paused midway of the ladder and regarded his visitor with\\nperceptible hesitation.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t this evening,\" he answered; \"the light is almost gone,\\nand I\\'ve a good deal to get through with after dark. I\\'ll manage\\nbetter to-morrow, if I can. By the way, why didn\\'t you show up at\\nWeatherby\\'s?\"\\n\\nWill came in and sat down on the edge of a big wooden box which\\ncontained the harness. In the four years he had changed but\\nlittle in appearance, though his slim figure had shot up rapidly\\nin height. His chestnut hair grew in high peaks from his temples\\nand swept in a single lock above his small, sparkling eyes, which\\nheld an expression of intelligent animation. On the whole, it was\\nnot an unpleasing face, despite the tremulous droop of the mouth,\\nalready darkened by the faint beginning of a brown mustache.\\n\\n\"Oh, Molly Peterkin stopped me in the road,\" he replied readily.\\n\"I\\'d caught her eye once or twice before, but this was the first\\nchance we\\'d had to speak. I tell you she\\'s a peach, Christopher.\"\\n\\nChristopher came down from the ladder and spread the straw evenly\\nin the horses\\' stalls.\\n\\n\"So they say,\" he responded; \"but I haven\\'t much of an eye for\\nwomen, you know. Now, when it comes to judging a leaf of tobacco,\\nI\\'m a match for any man.\"\\n\\n\"Well, one can\\'t be everything,\" remarked Will consolingly. He\\nsnatched at a piece of straw that had fallen on the lowest rung\\nof the ladder and began idly chewing it. \"As for me I know a\\nblamed sight more about women than I do about tobacco,\" he added,\\nwith a swagger.\\n\\nChristopher glanced up, and at sight of the boyish figure burst\\ninto a hearty laugh.\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re a jolly old sport, I know, and to think that Tom\\nSpade has been accusing me of leading you astray! Why, you are\\nalready twice the man that I am.\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! That\\'s just grandpa\\'s chatter! The old man rails at me\\nday and night about you until it\\'s a mortal wonder he doesn\\'t\\ndrive me to the dogs outright. I\\'d like to see another fellow\\nthat would put up with it for a week. Captain Morrison told him,\\nyou know, that I hadn\\'t done a peg of study for a year, and it\\nbrought on a scene that almost shook the roof. Now he swears I\\'m\\nto go to the university next fall or hang.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d go, by all means.\"\\n\\n\"What under heaven could I do there? All those confounded\\nlanguages Morrison poured into my head haven\\'t left so much as a\\nsingle letter of the alphabet. Ad nauseam is all I learned of\\nLatin. I tell you I\\'d rather be a storekeeper any time than a\\nscholar--books make me sick all over--and, when it comes to that,\\nI don\\'t believe I know much more to-day than you do.\"\\n\\nA smile crossed Christopher\\'s face, leaving it very grim. The\\nwords recalled to him his own earlier ambition--that of the\\ngentlemanly scholar of the old order--and there flickered before\\nhis eyes the visionary library, suffused with firelight, and the\\ntranslation of the \"Iliad\" he had meant to finish.\\n\\n\"I always told you it wasn\\'t worth anything,\" he said roughly.\\n\"She\\'d love you any better if you could spurt Greek?\"\\n\\nWill broke into a pleased laugh, his mind dwelling upon the fancy\\nthe other had conjured up so skilfully.\\n\\n\"Did you ever see such lips in your life?\" he inquired.\\n\\nChristopher shook his head. \"I haven\\'t noticed them, but Sol\\'s\\nhave a way of sticking in my memory.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you brute! It\\'s a shame that she should have such a father.\\nHe\\'s about the worst I ever met.\"\\n\\n\"Some think the shame is on the other side, you know.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a lie--she told me so. Fred Turner started the whole\\nthing because she refused to marry him at the last moment. She\\nfound out suddenly that she wasn\\'t in love with him. Girls are\\nlike that, you see. Why, Maria--\" Christopher looked up quickly.\\n\"I\\'ve nothing to do with your sister,\" he observed. \"I know that;\\nbut it\\'s true, all the same. Maria couldn\\'t tell her own mind any\\nbetter. Why, one day she was declaring that she was over head and\\nears in love with Jack, and the next she was wringing her hands\\nand begging him to go away.\" \"What are you going to do down at\\nthe store?\" asked Christopher abruptly. \"Oh, nothing in\\nparticular--just lounge, I suppose; there\\'s never anything to do.\\nBy the way, can\\'t we have a hunt to-morrow?\" \"I\\'ll see about it.\\nLook here, is your grandfather any worse than usual? He stormed\\nat me like mad yesterday because I wouldn\\'t turn my team of oxen\\nout of the road.\" \"It\\'s like blasting rock to get a decent word\\nout of him. The only time he\\'s been good-humoured for four years\\nwas the week we were away together. He offered me five thousand\\ndollars down if I\\'d never speak to you again.\" \"You don\\'t say\\nso!\" exclaimed Christopher. He bent his head and stood looking\\nthoughtfully at the matted straw under foot. \"Well, you had a\\nchance to turn a pretty penny,\" he said, in a tone of gentle\\nraillery. \"Oh, hang it! What do you mean?\" demanded Will. \"Of\\ncourse, I wasn\\'t going back on you like that just to please\\ngrandpa. I\\'d have been a confounded sneak if I had!\" \"You\\'re a\\njolly good chap and no mistake! But the old man would have been\\npleased, I reckon?\" Will grinned.\\n\\n\"You bet he would! I could twist him round my finger but for you,\\nAunt Saidie says.\" \"It will be all the same in the end, though.\\nThe whole thing will come to you some day.\" \"Oh, yes. Maria got\\nher share, and Wyndham has made ducks and drakes of it.\" \"Your\\ngrandfather\\'s aging, too, isn\\'t he?\"\\n\\n\"Rather,\" returned Will, with a curious mixture of amiable\\nlightness and cool brutality. \"He\\'s gone off at least twenty\\nyears since that time I had pneumonia in your barn. That wrecked\\nhim, Aunt Saidie says, and all because he knew he\\'d have to put\\nup with you when the doctor told him to let me have my way. His\\ntemper gets worse, too, all the time. I declare, he sometimes\\nmakes me wish he were dead and buried.\" \"Oh, he\\'ll live long\\nenough yet, never fear--those wiry, cross-grained people are as\\ntough as lightwood knots. It\\'s a pity, though, he wants to bully\\nyou like that--it would kill me in a day.\" A flush mounted to\\nWill\\'s forehead. \"I knew you\\'d think so,\" he said, \"and it\\'s what\\nI tell him all the time. He\\'s got no business meddling with me so\\nmuch, and I won\\'t stand it.\" \"He ought to get a dog,\" suggested\\nChristopher indifferently. \"Well, I\\'m not a dog, and I\\'ll make\\nhim understand it yet. Oh, you think I\\'m an awful milksop, of\\ncourse, but I\\'ll show you otherwise some day. I\\'d like to know if\\nyou could have done any better in my place?\" \"Done! Why, I\\nshouldn\\'t have been in your place long, that\\'s all.\" \"I shan\\'t,\\neither, for that matter; but I\\'ve got to humour him a little, you\\nsee, because he holds the purse-strings.\" \"He\\'d never go so far\\nas to kick you out, would he?\" \"Well, hardly. I\\'m all he has, you\\nknow. He doesn\\'t like Maria because of her fine airs, much as he\\nthinks of education. I\\'ve got to be a gentleman, he says; but as\\nfor him, he wouldn\\'t give up one of his vulgar habits to save\\nanybody\\'s soul. His trouble with Maria all came of her reproving\\nhim for drinking out of his saucer. Now, I don\\'t mind that kind\\nof thing so much, but Maria used to say she\\'d rather have him\\nsteal, any day, than gulp his coffee. Why are you laughing so?\"\\n\"Oh, nothing. Are you going to Tom\\'s now? I\\'ve got to work.\" Will\\nslid down from the big box and sauntered toward the door, pausing\\non the little wooden step to light a cigarette. \"Drop in if you\\nget a chance,\" he threw back over his shoulder, with a puff of\\nsmoke. In a few moments Christopher finished his work, and,\\ncoming\\noutside, closed the stable door. Then he walked a few paces along\\nthe little path stopping from time to time to gaze across the\\ndarkening landscape. A light mist was wreathed about the tops of\\nthe old lilac-bushes, where it glimmered so indistinctly that it\\nseemed as if one might dispel it by a breath; and farther away\\nthe soft evening colours had settled over the great fields,\\nbeyond which a clear yellow line was just visible above the\\ndistant woods. The wind was sharp with an edge of frost, and as\\nit blew into his face he raised his head and drank long,\\ninvigorating drafts. From the cattle-pen hard by he smelled the\\nfresh breath of the cows, and around him were those other odours,\\nvague, familiar, pleasant, which are loosened at twilight in the\\nopen country. The time had been when the mere physical contact\\nwith the air would have filled him with a quiet satisfaction, but\\nduring the last four years he had lost gradually his\\nsensitiveness to external things--to the changes of the seasons\\nas to the beauties of an autumn sunrise. A clear morning had\\nceased to arouse in him the old buoyant energy, and he had lost\\nthe zest of muscular exertion which had done so much to sweeten\\nhis labour in the fields. It was as if a clog fettered his\\nsimplest no less than his greatest emotion; and his enjoyment of\\nnature had grown dull and spiritless, like his affection for his\\nfamily. With his sisters he was aware that a curious constraint\\nhad become apparent, and it was no longer possible for him to\\nmeet his mother with the gay deference she still exacted. There\\nwere times, even, when he grew almost suspicious of Cynthia\\'s\\npatience, and at such moments his irritation was manifested in a\\nsullen reserve. To himself he could give no explanation of his\\nstate of mind; he knew merely that he retreated day by day\\nfarther into the shadow of his loneliness, and that, while in his\\nheart he still craved human sympathy, an expression of it even\\nfrom those he loved was, above all, the thing he most bitterly\\nresented. A light flashed in the kitchen, and he went on slowly\\ntoward the house. As he reached the back porch he saw that Lila\\nwas sitting at the kitchen window looking wearily out into the\\ndusk. The firelight scintillated in her eyes, and as she turned\\nquickly at a sound within the room he noticed with a pang that\\nthe sparkles were caused by teardrops on her lashes. His heart\\nquickened at the sight of her drooping figure, and an impulse\\nseized him to go in and comfort her at any cost. Then his severe\\nconstraint laid an icy hold upon him, and he hesitated with his\\nhand upon the door.\\n\\n\"If I go in and speak to her, what is there for me to say?\" he\\nthought, overcome by his horror of any uncontrolled emotion. \"We\\nwill merely go over the old complaints, the endless explanations.\\nShe will probably weep like a child, and I shall feel a brute\\nwhen I look on and keep silent. In the first place, if I speak to\\nher, what is there for me to say? If I simply beg her to stop\\ncrying, or if I rush in and urge her to marry Jim Weatherby\\nto-morrow, what good can come of either course? She doesn\\'t wait\\nfor my consent to the marriage, for she is as old as I am, and\\nknows her own heart much better than I know mine. It is true that\\nshe is too beautiful to waste away like this, but how can I\\nprevent it, or what is there for me to do?\"\\n\\nAgain came the impulse to go in and fold her in his arms, but\\nbefore he had taken the first step he yielded, as always, to his\\nstrange reserve, and he realised that if he entered it would be\\nbut to assume his customary unconcern, from the shelter of which\\nhe would probably make a few commonplace remarks on trivial\\nsubjects. The emotional situation would be ignored by them all,\\nhe knew; they would treat it absolutely as if it had no\\nexistence, as if its voice was not speaking to them in the\\nsilence, and they would break their bread and drink their coffee\\nin apparent unconsciousness that supper was not the single thing\\nthat engrossed their thoughts. And all the time they would be\\nface to face with the knowledge that they had demanded that Lila\\nshould sacrifice her life.\\n\\nPresently Cynthia came out and called him, and he went in\\ncarelessly and sat down at the table. Lila left the window and\\nslipped into her place, and when Tucker joined them she cut up\\nhis food as usual and prepared his coffee.\\n\\n\"Uncle Tucker\\'s cup has no handle, Cynthia,\" she said with\\nconcern. \"Let me take this one and give him another.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I never!\" exclaimed Cynthia, bending over to examine the\\nbreak with her near-sighted squint. \"We\\'ll soon have to begin\\nusing Aunt Susannah\\'s set, if this keeps up. Uncle Boaz, you\\'ve\\nbroken another cup to-day.\"\\n\\nHer tone was sharp with irritation, and the fine wrinkles caused\\nby ceaseless small worries appeared instantly between her\\neyebrows. Christopher, watching her, remembered that she had worn\\nthe same expression during the scene with Lila, and it annoyed\\nhim unspeakably that she should be able to descend so readily,\\nand with equal energy, upon so insignificant a grievance as a bit\\nof broken china.\\n\\nUncle Boaz hobbled round the table and peered contemptuously at\\nthe cup which Lila held.\\n\\n\"Dar warn\\' no use bruckin\\' dat ar one,\" he observed, \"\\'caze \\'twuz\\nbruck a\\'ready.\" \" Oh, there won\\'t be a piece left presently,\"\\npursued Cynthia indignantly; and Christopher felt suddenly that\\nthere was something contemptible in the passion she expended upon\\ntrifles. He wondered if Tucker noticed how horribly petty it all\\nwas to lament a broken cup when the tears were hardly dried on\\nLila\\'s cheeks. Finishing hurriedly, he pushed back his chair and\\nrose from the table, shaking his head in response to Cynthia\\'s\\nrequest that he should go in to see his mother. \"Not now,\" he\\nsaid impatiently, with that nervous avoidance of the person he\\nloved best. \"I\\'ll be back in time to carry her to bed, but I\\'ve\\ngot to take a half-hour off and look in on Tom Spade.\" \"She\\nreally ought to go to bed before sundown,\" responded Cynthia,\\n\"but nothing under heaven will persuade her to do so. It\\'s her\\nwonderful will that keeps her alive, just as it keeps her sitting\\nbolt upright in that old chair. I don\\'t believe there\\'s another\\nwoman on earth who could have done it for more than twenty\\nyears.\" Taking down his hat from a big nail in the wall,\\nChristopher stood for a moment abstractedly fingering the brim.\\n\"Well, I\\'ll be back shortly,\" he said at last, and went out\\nhurriedly into the darkness. At the instant he could not tell why\\nhe had so suddenly decided to follow Will Fletcher to the store,\\nbut, as usual, when the impulse came to him he proceeded to act\\npromptly as it directed. Strangely enough, the boy was the one\\nhuman being whom he felt no inclination to avoid, and the least\\noppressive moments that he knew were the reckless ones they spent\\ntogether. While his daily companion was mentally and morally upon\\na lower plane than his own, the association was not without a\\nbalm for his wounded pride; and the knowledge that it was still\\npossible to assume superiority to Fletcher\\'s heir was, so far as\\nhe himself admitted, the one consolation that his life contained.\\nAs for his feeling toward Will Fletcher as an individual, it was\\nthe outcome of so curious a mixture of attraction and repulsion\\nthat he had long ceased from any attempt to define it as pure\\nemotion. For the last four years the boy had been, as Tom Spade\\nput it, \"the very shadow on the man\\'s footsteps,\" and yet at the\\nend of that time it was almost impossible for Christopher to\\nacknowledge either his liking or his hatred. He had suffered him\\nfor his own end, that was all, and he had come at last almost to\\nenjoy the tolerance that he displayed. The hero worship--the\\nnatural imitation of youth-- was at least not unpleasant, and\\nthere had been days during a brief absence of the boy when\\nChristopher had, to his surprise, become aware of a positive\\nvacancy in his surroundings. So long as Will made no evident\\nattempt to rise above him--so long, indeed, as Fletcher\\'s\\ngrandson kept to Fletcher\\'s level, it was possible that the\\ncompanionship would continue as harmoniously as it had begun. In\\nthe store he found Tom Spade and his wife--an angular,\\nstrong-featured woman, in purple calico, who carried off the\\nreputation of a shrew with noisy honours. When he asked for Will,\\nthe storekeeper turned from the cash-drawer which he was emptying\\nand nodded toward the half-open door of the adjoining room.\\n\\n\"Several of the young fellows are in thar now,\" he remarked\\noffhand, \"an\\' I\\'ve jest had to go in an\\' git between Fred Turner\\nan\\' Will Fletcher. They came to out an\\' out blows, an\\' I had to\\nshake \\'em both by the scuff of thar necks befo\\' they\\'d hish\\n\\nsnarlin\\'. Bless yo\\' life, all about a woman, too, every last word\\nof it. Well, well, meanin\\' no disrespect to you, Susan, it\\'s a\\nqueer thing that a man can\\'t be born, married, or buried without\\na woman gittin\\' herself mixed up in the business. If she ain\\'t\\nwrappin\\' you in swaddlin\\' bands, you may be sho\\' she\\'s measurin\\'\\noff yo\\' windin\\'-sheet. Mark my words, Mr. Christopher, I don\\'t\\nbelieve thar\\'s ever been a fight fought on this earth--be it a\\nbattle or a plain fisticuff--that it warn\\'t started in the brain\\nof somebody\\'s mother, wife, or sweetheart an\\' it\\'s most likely to\\nhave been the sweetheart. It is strange, when you come to study\\n\\'bout it, how sech peaceable-lookin\\' creaturs as women kin have\\nsech hearty appetites for trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Well, trouble may be born of a woman, but it generally manages\\nto take the shape of a man,\" observed Mrs. Spade from behind the\\ncounter, where she was filling a big glass jar with a fresh\\nsupply of striped peppermint candy. \"And as far as that goes,\\never sence the Garden of Eden, men have taken a good deal mo\\'\\npleasure in layin\\' the blame on thar wives than they do in layin\\'\\nblows on the devil. It\\'s a fortunate woman that don\\'t wake up the\\nday after the weddin\\' an\\' find she\\'s married an Adam instid of a\\nman. However, they are as the Lord made \\'em, I reckon,\" she\\nfinished charitably, \"which ain\\'t so much to thar credit as it\\nsounds, seein\\' they could have done over sech a po\\' job with\\nprecious little trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I warn\\'t aimin\\' at you, Susan,\" Tom hastened to assure her,\\naware from experience that he entered an argument only to be\\nworsted. \"You\\'ve been a good wife to me, for all yo\\' sharp\\ntongue, an\\' I\\'ve never had to git up an\\' light the fire sence the\\nday I married you. Yes, you\\'ve been a first-rate wife to me, an\\'\\nno mistake.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m the last person you need tell that to,\" was Mrs. Spade\\'s\\nretort. \"I don\\'t reckon I\\'ve b\\'iled inside an\\' sweated outside\\nfor mo\\' than twenty years without knowin\\' it. Lord! Lord! If it\\ntook as hard work to be a Christian as it does to be a wife,\\nthar\\'d be mighty few but men in the next world--an\\' they\\'d git\\nthar jest by followin\\' like sheep arter Adam--\"\\n\\n\"I declar\\', Susan, I didn\\'t mean to rile you,\" urged Tom,\\nbreaking in upon the flow of words with an appealing effort to\\ndivert its course. \"I was merely crackin\\' a joke with Mr.\\nChristopher, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m plum sick of these here jokes that\\'s got to have a woman on\\nthe p\\'int of \\'em,\" returned Mrs. Spade, tightly screwing on the\\ntop of the glass jar. \"I\\'ve always noticed that thar ain\\'t\\nnothin\\' so funny in this world but it gits a long sight funnier\\nif a man kin turn it on his wife.\"\\n\\n\"Now, my dear--\" helplessly expostulated Tom.\\n\\n\"My name\\'s Susan, Tom Spade, an\\' I\\'ll have you call me by it or\\nnot at all. If thar\\'s one thing I hate on this earth it\\'s a\\n\\'dear\\' in the mouth of a married man that ought to know better.\\nI\\'d every bit as lief you\\'d shoot a lizard at me, an\\' you ain\\'t\\njest found it out. If you think I\\'m the kind of person to git any\\nsatisfaction out of improper speeches you were never mo\\' mistaken\\nin yo\\' life; an\\' I kin p\\'int out to you right now that I ain\\'t\\nnever heard one of them words yit that I ain\\'t had to pay for it.\\nA \\'dear\\' the mo\\' is mighty apt to mean a bucket of water the\\nless. Oh, you can\\'t turn my head with yo\\' soft tricks, Tom Spade.\\nI\\'m a respectable woman, as my mother was befo\\' me, an\\' I don\\'t\\nwant familiar doin\\'s from any man, alive or dead. The woman who\\ndoes, whether she be married or single, ain\\'t no better than a\\nfemale--that\\'s my opinion!\"\\n\\nShe paused to draw breath, and Tom was quick to take advantage of\\nthe intermission. \"Good Lord, Mr. Christopher, those darn young\\nfools are at it agin! \" he exclaimed, darting toward the\\nadjoining room.\\n\\nWith a stride, Christopher pushed past him and, opening the door,\\nstopped uncertainly upon the threshold.\\n\\nAt the first glance he saw that the trouble was between Will and\\nFred Turner, and that Will, because of his slighter weight, had\\ngot very much the worst of the encounter. The boy stood now,\\ntrembling with anger and bleeding at the mouth, beside an\\noverturned table, while Fred--a stout, brawny fellow--was busily\\npummelling his shoulders.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a sneakin\\', puny-livered liar, that\\'s what you are!\"\\nfinished Turner with a vengeance.\\n\\nChristopher walked leisurely across the room.\\n\\n\"And you\\'re another,\" he observed in a quiet voice--the voice of\\nhis courtly father, which always came to him in moments of white\\nheat. \"You are exactly that--a sneaking, puny-livered liar.\" His\\nmanner was so courteous that it came as a surprise when he struck\\nout from the shoulder and felled Fred as easily as he might have\\nknocked over a wooden tenpin. \"You really must learn better\\nmanners,\" he remarked coolly, looking down upon him.\\n\\nThen he wiped his brow on his blue shirt-sleeve and called for a\\nglass of beer.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III. Mrs. Blake Speaks her Mind on Several Matters\\n\\nBreakfast was barely over the next morning when Jim Weatherby\\nappeared at the kitchen door carrying a package of horseshoe\\nnails and a small hammer.\\n\\n\"I thought perhaps Christopher might want to use the mare early,\"\\nhe explained to Cynthia, who was clearing off the table. There\\nwas a pleasant precision in his speech, acquired with much\\nindustry at the little country school, and Cynthia, despite her\\nrigid disfavour, could not but notice that when he glanced round\\nthe room in search of Lila he displayed the advantage of an\\naristocratic profile. Until to-day she could not remember that\\nshe had ever seen him directly, as it were; she had looked around\\nhim and beyond him, much as she might have obliterated from her\\nvision a familiar shrub that chanced to intrude itself into her\\npoint of view. The immediate result of her examination was the\\npossibility she dimly acknowledged that a man might exist as a\\nwell-favoured individual and yet belong to an unquestionably\\nlower class of life.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll go out to the stable,\" added Jim, after a moment in\\nwhich he had patiently submitted to her squinting observation.\\n\"Christopher will be somewhere about, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I suppose so,\" replied Cynthia indifferently, emptying the\\ncoffee-grounds into the kitchen sink. The asperity of her tone\\nwas caused by the entrance of Lila, who came in with a basin of\\ncorn-meal dough tucked under her bared arm, which showed as round\\nand delicate as a child\\'s beneath her loosely rolled-up sleeve.\\n\\n\"Cynthia, I can\\'t find the hen-house key,\" she began; and then,\\ncatching sight of Jim, she flushed a clear pink, while the little\\nbrown mole ran a race with the dimple in her check.\\n\\n\"The key is on that nail beside the dried hops,\" returned Cynthia\\nsternly. \"I found it in the lock last night and brought it in.\\nIt\\'s a mercy that the chickens weren\\'t all stolen.\"\\n\\nWithout replying, Lila took down the key, strung it on her little\\nfinger, and, going to the door, passed with Jim out into the\\nautumn sunshine. Her soft laugh pulsed back presently, and\\nCynthia, hearing it, set her thin lips tightly as she carefully\\nrinsed the coffee-pot with soda.\\n\\nChristopher, who had just come up to the wellbrink, where Tucker\\nsat feeding the hounds from a plate of scraps, gave an abrupt nod\\nin the direction of the lovers strolling slowly down the\\nhen-house path.\\n\\n\"It will end that way some day, I reckon,\" he said with a sigh,\\n\"and you know I\\'m almost of a mind with Cynthia about it. It does\\nseem a downright pity. Not that Jim isn\\'t a good chap and all\\nthat, but he\\'s an honest, hard-working farmer and nothing more--\\nand, good heavens! just look at Lila! Why, she\\'s beautiful enough\\nto set the world afire.\"\\n\\nSmiling broadly, Tucker tossed a scrap of cornbread into Spy\\'s\\nopen jaws; then his gaze travelled leisurely to the hen-house,\\nwhich Lila had just unlocked. As she pushed back the door there\\nwas a wild flutter of wings, and the big fowls flew in a swarm\\nabout her feet, one great red-and-black rooster craning his long\\nneck after the basin she held beneath her arm. While she\\nscattered the soft dough on the ground she bent her head slightly\\nsideways, looking up at Jim, who stood regarding her with\\nenraptured eyes.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know that much good ever comes of setting anything\\nafire,\" answered Tucker with his amiable chuckle; \"the danger is\\nthat you\\'re apt to cause a good deal of trouble somewhere, and\\nit\\'s more than likely you\\'ll get singed yourself in putting out\\nthe flame. You needn\\'t worry about Lila, Christopher; she\\'s the\\nkind of woman--and they\\'re rare--who doesn\\'t have to have her\\nhappiness made to order; give her any fair amount of the raw\\nmaterial and she\\'ll soon manage to fit it perfectly to herself.\\nThe stuff is in her, I tell you; the atmosphere is about her-\\n-can\\'t you feel it--and she\\'s going to be happy, whatever comes.\\nA woman who can make over a dress the sixth time as cheerfully as\\nshe did the first has the spirit of a Caesar, and doesn\\'t need\\nyour lamentations. If you want to be a Jeremiah, you must go\\nelsewhere.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I dare say she\\'ll grow content, but it does seem such a\\nterrible waste. She\\'s the image of that Saint-Memin portrait of\\nAunt Susannah, and if she\\'d only been born a couple of\\ngenerations ago she would probably have been the belle of two\\ncontinents. Such women must be scarce anywhere.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s pretty enough, certainly, and I think Jim knows it.\\nThere\\'s but one thing I\\'ve ever seen that could compare with her\\nfor colour, and that\\'s a damask rose that blooms in May on an old\\nbush in the front yard. When all is said, however, that young\\nWeatherby is no clodhopper, you know, and I\\'m not sure that he\\nisn\\'t worthier of her than any highsounding somebody across the\\nwater would have been. He can love twice as hard, I\\'ll wager, and\\nthat\\'s the chief thing, after all; it\\'s worth more than big\\ntitles or fine clothes--or even than dead grandfathers, with due\\nrespect to Cynthia. I tell you, Lila may never stir from the\\nmidst of these tobacco fields; she may be buried alive all her\\ndays between these muddy roads that lead heaven knows where, and\\nyet she may live a lot bigger and fuller life than she might have\\ndone with all London at her feet, as they say it was at your\\nGreataunt Susannah\\'s. The person who has to have outside props to\\nkeep him straight must have been made mighty crooked at the\\nstart, and Lila\\'s not like that.\"\\n\\nChristopher stooped and pulled Spy\\'s ears.\\n\\n\"That\\'s as good a way to look at it as any other, I reckon,\" he\\nremarked; \"and now I\\'ve got to hurry the shoeing of the mare.\"\\n\\nHe crossed over and joined Lila and Jim before the henhouse door,\\nwhere he put the big fowls to noisy flight.\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re a trusty neighbour, \" he cried good-humoredly,\\nstriking Jim a friendly blow that sent him reeling out into the\\npath.\\n\\nLila passed her hand in a sweeping movement round the inside of\\nthe basin and flirted the last drops of dough from her\\nfinger-tips.\\n\\n\"A few of your pats will cripple Jim for a week,\" she observed,\\n\"so you\\'d better be careful; he\\'s too useful a friend to lose\\nwhile there are any jobs to do.\"\\n\\n\"Why, if I had that muscle I could run a farm with one hand,\"\\nsaid Jim. \"Give a plough a single push, Christopher, and I\\nbelieve it would run as long as there was level ground.\"\\n\\nCynthia, standing at the kitchen window with a cuptowel slung\\nacross her arm, watched the three chatting merrily in the\\nsunshine, and the look of rigid resentment settled like a mask\\nupon her face. She was still gazing out upon them when Docia\\nopened the door behind her and informed her in a whisper that\\n\"Ole miss wanted her moughty quick.\"\\n\\n\"All right, Docia. Is anything the matter?\"\\n\\n\"Naw\\'m, \\'tain\\' nuttin\\' \\'tall de matter. She\\'s des got fidgetty.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll come in a minute. Are you better to-day? How\\'s your\\nheart?\"\\n\\n\"Lawd, Miss Cynthia, hit\\'s des bruised all over. Ev\\'y breaf I\\ndraw hits it plum like a hammer. I hyear hit thump, thump, thump\\nall de blessed time.\"\\n\\n\"Be careful, then. Tell mother I\\'m coming at once.\"\\n\\nShe hung the cup-towel on the rack, and, taking off her blue\\nchecked apron, went along the little platform to the main part of\\nthe house and into the old lady\\'s parlour, where the morning\\nsunshine fell across the faces of generations of dead Blakes. The\\nroom was still furnished with the old rosewood furniture, and the\\nold damask curtains hung before the single window, which gave on\\nthe overgrown front yard and the twisted aspen. Though the rest\\nof the house suggested only the direst poverty, the immediate\\nsurroundings of Mrs. Blake revealed everywhere the lavish ease so\\ncharacteristic of the old order which had passed away. The\\ncarving on the desk, on the book-cases, on the slender sofa, was\\nall wrought by tedious handwork; the delicate damask coverings to\\nthe chairs were still lustrous after almost half a century; and\\nthe few vases scattered here and there and filled with autumn\\nflowers were, for the most part, rare pieces of old royal\\nWorcester. While it was yet Indian summer, there was no need of\\nfires, and the big fireplace was filled with goldenrod, which\\nshed a yellow dust down on the rude brick hearth.\\n\\nThe old lady, inspired by her indomitable energy, was already\\ndressed for the day in her black brocade, and sat bolt upright\\namong the pillows in her great oak chair.\\n\\n\"Some one passed the window whistling, Cynthia. Who was it? The\\nwhistle had a pleasant, cheery sound.\"\\n\\n\"It must have been Jim Weatherby, I think: old Jacob\\'s son.\"\\n\\n\"Is he over here?\"\\n\\n\"To see Christopher--yes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, be sure to remind the servants to give him something to\\neat in the kitchen before he goes back, and I think, if he\\'s a\\ndecent young man, I should like to have a little talk with him\\nabout his family. His father used to be one of our most\\nrespectable labourers.\"\\n\\n\"It would tire you, I fear, mother. Shall I give you your\\nknitting now?\"\\n\\n\"You have a most peculiar idea about me, my child. I have not yet\\nreached my dotage, and I don\\'t think that a little talk with\\nyoung Weatherby could possibly be much of an ordeal. Is he an\\nimproper person?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, of course not; you shall see him whenever you like. I\\nwas only thinking of you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m sure I am very grateful for your consideration, my\\ndear, but there are times, occasionally, you know, when it is\\nbetter for one to judge for oneself. I sometimes think that your\\nonly fault, Cynthia, is that you are a little--just a very little\\nbit, you understand--inclined to manage things too much. Your\\npoor father used to say that a domineering woman was like a\\nkicking cow; but this doesn\\'t apply to you, of course.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I call Jim now, mother?\"\\n\\n\"You might as well, dear. Place a chair for him, a good stout\\none, and be sure to make him wipe his feet before he comes in.\\nDoes he appear to be clean?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, perfectly.\"\\n\\n\"I remember his father always was--unusually so for a common\\nlabourer. Those people sometimes smell of cattle, you know; and\\nbesides, my nose has grown extremely sensitive in the years since\\nI lost my eyesight. Perhaps it would be as well to hand me the\\nbottle of camphor. I can pretend I have a headache.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no need, really; he isn\\'t a labourer at all, you know,\\nand he looks quite a gentleman. He is, I believe, considered a\\nvery handsome young man.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blake waved toward the door and the piece of purple glass\\nflashed in the sunlight. \"In that case, I might offer him some\\nsensible advice,\" she said. \"The Weatherbys, I remember, always\\nshowed a very proper respect for gentle people. I distinctly\\nrecall how well Jacob behaved when on one occasion Micajah\\nBlair--a dreadful, dissolute character, though of a very old\\nfamily and an intimate friend of your father\\'s--took decidedly\\ntoo much egg-nog one Christmas when he was visiting us, and\\ninsisted upon biting Jacob\\'s cheek because it looked so like a\\nwinesap. Jacob had come to see your father on business, and I\\nwill say that he displayed a great deal of good sense and\\ndignity; he said afterward that he didn\\'t mind the bite on his\\ncheek at all, but that it pained him terribly to see a Virginia\\ngentleman who couldn\\'t balance a bowl of egg-nog. Well, well,\\nMicajah was certainly a rake, I fear; and for that matter, so was\\nhis father before him.\"\\n\\n\"Father had queer friends,\" observed Cynthia sadly. \"I remember\\nhis telling me when I was a little girl that he preferred that\\nfamily to any in the county.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the family was all right, my dear. I never heard a breath\\nagainst the women. Now you may fetch Jacob. Is that his name?\"\\n\\n\"No; Jim.\"\\n\\n\"Dear me; that\\'s very odd. He certainly should have been called\\nafter his father. I wonder how they could have been so\\nthoughtless.\"\\n\\nCynthia drew forward an armchair, stooped and carefully arranged\\nthe ottoman, and then went with stern determination to look for\\nJim Weatherby.\\n\\nHe was sitting in the stable doorway, fitting a shoe on the old\\nmare, while Lila leaned against an overturned barrel in the\\nsunshine outside. At Cynthia\\'s sudden appearance they both\\nstarted and looked up in amazement, the words dying slowly on\\ntheir lips.\\n\\n\"Why, whatever is the matter, Cynthia?\" cried Lila, as if in\\nterror.\\n\\nCynthia came forward until she stood directly at the mare\\'s head,\\nwhere she delivered her message with a gasp:\\n\\n\"Mother insists upon talking to Jim. There\\'s no help for it; he\\nmust come.\"\\n\\nWeatherby dropped the mare\\'s hoof and raised a breathless\\nquestion to Cynthia\\'s face, while Lila asked quickly:\\n\\n\"Does she know?\"\\n\\n\"Know what?\" demanded Cynthia, turning grimly upon her. \"Of\\ncourse she knows that Jim is his father\\'s son.\"\\n\\nThe young man rose and laid the hammer down on the overturned\\nbarrel; then he led the mare back to her stall, and coming out\\nagain, washed his hands in a tub of water by the door.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m ready,\" he observed quietly. \"Shall I go in alone?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we don\\'t ask that of you,\" said Lila, laughing. \"Come; I\\'ll\\ntake you.\" She slipped her hand under his arm and they went gaily\\ntoward the house, leaving Cynthia to pick up the horseshoe nails\\nlying loose upon the ground.\\n\\nHearing the young man\\'s step on the threshold, Mrs. Blake turned\\nher head with a smile of pleasant condescension and stretched out\\nher delicate yellowed hand.\\n\\n\"This is Jim Weatherby, mother,\" said Lila in her softest voice.\\n\"Cynthia says you want to talk to him.\"\\n\\n\"I know, my child; I know,\" returned Mrs. Blake, with an animated\\ngesture. \"Come in, Jim, and don\\'t trouble to stand. Find him a\\nchair, Lila. I knew your father long before you were born,\" she\\nadded, turning to the young man, \"and I knew only good of him. I\\nsuppose he has often told you of the years he worked for us?\"\\n\\nJim held her hand for an instant in his own, and then, bending\\nover, raised it to his lips.\\n\\n\"My father never tires of telling us about the old times, and\\nabout Mr. Blake and yourself,\" he answered in his precise\\nEnglish, and with the simple dignity which he never lost. Lila,\\nwatching him, prayed silently that a miracle might open the old\\nlady\\'s eyes and allow her to see the kind, manly look upon his\\nface.\\n\\nMrs. Blake nodded pleasantly, with evident desire to put him\\nwholly at his ease.\\n\\n\"Well, his son is becoming quite courtly,\" she responded,\\nsmiling, \"and I know Jacob is proud of you--or he ought to be,\\nwhich amounts to the same thing. There\\'s nothing I like better\\nthan to see a good, hard-working family prosper in life and raise\\nits station. Not that I mean to put ideas into your head, of\\ncourse, for it is a ridiculous sight to see a person dissatisfied\\nwith the position in which the good Lord has placed him. That was\\nwhat I always liked about your mother, and I remember very well\\nher refusing to wear some of my old finery when she was married,\\non the ground that she was a plain, honest woman, and wanted to\\ncontinue so when she was a wife. I hope, by the way, that she is\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, quite. She does not walk much, though; her joints have been\\ntroubling her.\"\\n\\nTo Lila\\'s surprise, he was not the least embarrassed by the\\npersonal tone of the conversation, and his sparkling blue eyes\\nheld their usual expression of blithe good-humour.\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" Mrs. Blake pricked at the subject in her sprightly way.\\n\"Well, you must persuade her to use a liniment of Jamestown weed\\nsteeped in whisky. There is positively nothing like it for\\nrheumatism. Lila, do we still make it for the servants? If so,\\nyou might send Sarah Weatherby a bottle.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see about it, mother. Aren\\'t you tired? Shall I take Jim\\naway?\"\\n\\n\"Not just yet, child. I am interested in seeing what a promising\\nyoung man he has become. How old are you, Jim?\"\\n\\n\"Twenty-nine next February. There are two of us, you know--I\\'ve a\\nsister Molly. She married Frank Granger and moved ten miles\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that brings me to the very point I was driving at. Above all\\nthings, let me caution you most earnestly against the reckless\\nmarriages so common in your station of life. For heaven\\'s sake,\\ndon\\'t marry a woman because she has a pretty face and you cherish\\nan impracticable sentiment for her. If you take my advice, you\\nwill found your marriage upon mutual respect and industry. Select\\na wife who is not afraid of work, and who expects no folderol of\\nromance. Love-making, I\\'ve always maintained, should be the\\npastime of the leisure class exclusively.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not afraid of work myself,\" replied Jim, laughing as he\\nlooked boldly into the old lady\\'s sightless eyes, \"but I\\'d never\\nstand it for my wife--not a--a lick of it!\"\\n\\n\"Tut, tut! Your mother does it.\"\\n\\nJim nodded. \"But I\\'m not my father,\" he mildly suggested.\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'re a fine, headstrong young fool, and I like you all\\nthe better for it,\" declared Mrs. Blake. \"You may go now, because\\nI feel as if I needed a doze; but be sure to come in and see me\\nthe next time you\\'re over here. Lila, put the cat on my knees and\\nstraighten my pillows.\"\\n\\nLila lifted the cat from the rug and placed it in the old lady\\'s\\nlap; then, as she arranged the soft white pillows, she bent over\\nsuddenly and kissed the piece of purple glass on the fragile\\nhand.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV. In Which Christopher Hesitates\\n\\nFollowing his impulsive blow in defense of Will Fletcher,\\nChristopher experienced, almost with his next breath, a reaction\\nin his feeling for the boy; and meeting him two days later at the\\ndoor of the tobacco barn, he fell at once into a tone of\\ncontemptuous raillery.\\n\\n\"So you let Fred smash you up, eh?\" he observed, with a sneer.\\n\\nWill flushed.\\n\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t talk like that,\" he answered; \"he\\'s the biggest\\nman about here except you. By the way, you\\'re a bully friend to a\\nfellow, you know, and it\\'s not a particle of use pretending you\\ndon\\'t like me, because you can\\'t help hitting back jolly quick\\nwhen anybody undertakes to give me a licking.\"\\n\\n\"Why were you such a fool as to go at him?\" inquired Christopher,\\nglancing up at his evenly hanging rows of tobacco, and then\\ncoming outside to lock the door. \"You\\'ll never get a reputation\\nas a fighter if you are always jumping on men over your own size.\\nNow, next time I should advise you to try your spirit on Sol\\nPeterkin.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it was all about Molly,\" explained Will frankly. \"I told\\nFred that he was a big blackguard to use the girl so, and then he\\ncalled me a \\'white-livered liar.\\'\"\\n\\n\"I heard him,\" remarked Christopher quietly.\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t care what he says--he is a blackguard. I\\'m glad\\nyou knocked him down, too; it was no more than he deserved.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t do it on Molly Peterkin\\'s account, you know. Tobacco\\ntakes up quite enough of my time without my entering the lists as\\na champion of light women. But if you aren\\'t man enough to fight\\nyour own battles, I suppose I\\'ll have to keep my muscle in proper\\nshape.\"\\n\\nWill smarted from the words, and the corners of his mouth took a\\ndogged droop.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see how you expect me to be a match for Fred Turner,\" he\\nreturned angrily.\\n\\n\"Why, I don\\'t expect it,\" replied Christopher coolly, as he\\nturned the key in the padlock, drew it out, and slipped it into\\nhis pocket. \"I expect you merely to keep away from him, that\\'s\\nall.\"\\n\\nWill stared at him in perplexity. \"What a devil of a humour you\\nare in!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n\"Am I?\" Christopher broke into a laugh. \"You are accustomed to\\nthe sunny temper of your grandfather. How is he to-day? In his\\nusual cheerful vein?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s awful,\" answered the boy, relieved at the change of\\nsubject. \"If you could only have heard him yesterday! Somebody\\ntold him about the fight at the store, and, as luck would have\\nit, he found out that Molly Peterkin was at the bottom of it all.\\nWhen he called me into his room and locked the door I knew\\nsomething was up; and sure enough, we had blood and thunder for\\ntwo mortal hours. He threatened to sell the horses and the\\nhounds, and to put me at the plough, if I ever so much as looked\\nat the girl again--\\'gal,\\' he called her, and a \\'brazen wench.\\'\\nThat is the way he talks, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" Christopher nodded gravely.\\n\\n\"But the funny part is, that the thing that made him hottest was\\nyour knocking over Fred Turner. That he simply couldn\\'t stand.\\nWhy, he\\'d have paid Fred fifty dollars down to thrash me black\\nand blue, he said. He called you--Oh, he has a great store of pet\\nnames!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Christopher, for the other caught himself up\\nsuddenly.\\n\\n\"Nothing much--he\\'s always doing it, you know.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t trouble yourself on my account. I\\'m familiar with\\nhis use of words.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he called you \\'a crazy pauper who ought to be in gaol.\\'\"\\n\\n\"He did, did he? Well, for once in his life he drew it mild.\"\\nThen he gave a long whistle and kicked away a rock in the path. \"\\n\"\\'A crazy pauper who ought to be in gaol.\\' I\\'ve a pretty\\ngood-sized debt to settle with your grandfather, when I come to\\nthink of it.\"\\n\\n\"Just suppose you were in my place now,\" insisted Will. \"Then I\\nreckon you\\'d have cause forswearing, sure enough. I tell you I\\ncouldn\\'t get out of that room yesterday until I promised him I\\'d\\nturn over a new leaf--that I\\'d start in with Mr. Morrison\\nto-morrow, and dig away at Latin and Greek until I go to the\\nuniversity next fall.\"\\n\\nChristopher turned quickly.\\n\\n\"To-morrow?\" he repeated. \"Why, that\\'s the day I had planned we\\'d\\ngo hunting. Make Morrison\\'s Friday.\"\\n\\nThe boy wavered.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t we go another day?\" he asked. \"He\\'s so awfully set on\\nto-morrow. I\\'d have to be mighty sharp to fool him again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, well, but it\\'s the only day I\\'ve free. There\\'s a lot of fall\\nploughing to do; then the apples are ready to be gathered; and I\\nmust take some corn to the mill before the week\\'s up. I\\'ve wasted\\ntoo much time with you as it is. It\\'s the only wealth I have, you\\nsee.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll go--I\\'ll go,\" declared Will, jumping to a decision.\\n\"There\\'ll be a terrific fuss if he finds it out, but perhaps he\\nwon\\'t. I\\'ll bring my gun over to the barn to-night, and get\\nZebbadee to meet us with the hounds at the bend in the road.\\nWell, I must get back now. I don\\'t want him to suspect I\\'ve seen\\nyou to-day.\"\\n\\nHe started off at a rapid pace, and Christopher, turning in the\\nother direction, went to bring the horses from the distant\\npasture. It was a mellow afternoon, and a golden haze wrapped the\\nbroad meadow, filled with autumn wild flowers, and the little\\nbricked-up graveyard on the low, green hill. As he swung himself\\nover the bars at the end of the path he saw Lila and Jim\\nWeatherby gathering goldenrod in the center of the field. When\\nthey caught sight of him, Jim laid his handful of blossoms in a\\nbig basket on the ground and came to join him on his way to the\\npasture.\\n\\n\"They are for Mrs. Blake\\'s fireplace,\" he remarked with a\\nfriendly smile, as he glanced back at Lila standing knee-deep\\namid the October flowers.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a queer idea,\" observed Christopher, finding himself at a\\nloss for a reply.\\n\\nJim strolled on leisurely, snatching at the heads of wild carrot\\nas he passed.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something I\\'ve wanted to tell you, Christopher,\" he said\\nafter a moment, turning his pleasant, manly face upon the other.\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" asked Christopher, with a sudden desire to avert\\nthe impending responsibility. \"Oh, but I hardly think I\\'m the\\nproper person, \" he added, laughing.\\n\\nJim met his eyes squarely.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a plain man,\" he said slowly, \"and though I\\'m not ashamed of\\nit, I know, of course, that my family have always been plain\\npeople. As things are, I had no business on earth to fall in love\\nwith your sister, but all the same it\\'s what I\\'ve gone and done.\"\\n\\nChristopher nodded and walked on.\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose it\\'s what I should have done, too, in your\\nplace,\" he returned quietly.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve reproached myself for it often enough,\" pursued Jim; \"but\\nwhen all is said, how can a man prevent a thing like that? I\\nmight as well try to shut my eyes to the sun when it is shining\\nstraight on me. Why, everybody else seems dull and lifeless when\\nI look at her--and I seem such a brute myself that I hardly dare\\ntouch her hand. All I ask is to be her servant until I die.\"\\n\\nIt took courage to speak such words, and Christopher, knowing it,\\nstopped midway of the little path and regarded Jim with the rare\\nsmile which gave a boyish brightness to his face.\\n\\n\"By George, you are a trump!\" he said heartily. \"And as far as\\nthat goes, you\\'re good enough for Lila or for anybody else. It\\nisn\\'t that, you see; it\\'s only--\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" finished Jim quietly and without resentment; \"it\\'s my\\ngrandfather. Your sister, Cynthia, told me, and I reckon it\\'s all\\nnatural, but somehow I can\\'t make myself ashamed of the old man--\\nnor is Lila, for that matter. He was an honest, upright body as\\never you saw, and he never did a mean thing in his life, though\\nhe lived to be almost ninety.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right,\" said Christopher, flushing suddenly; \"and as far\\nas I\\'m concerned, I\\'d let Lila marry you to-morrow; but as for\\nmother, she would simply never consent. The idea would be\\nimpossible to her, and we could never explain things; you must\\nsee that yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" replied Jim readily; \"but the main point is that you\\nyourself would have no objection to our marriage, provided it\\nwere possible.\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit; not a bit.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand, and Jim shook it warmly before he picked up\\nhis basket and went to rejoin Lila.\\n\\nTurning in the path, Christopher saw the girl, who was sitting\\nalone on the lowered bars, rise and wave a spray of goldenrod\\nabove her head. Then, as the lovers met, she laid her hand upon\\nJim\\'s arm and lifted her glowing face as if to read his words\\nbefore he uttered them. Something in the happy surrender of her\\ngesture, or in the brooding mystery of the Indian summer, when\\none seemed to hear the earth turn in the stillness, touched\\nChristopher with a sudden melancholy, and it appeared to him when\\nhe went on again that a shadow had fallen over the brightness of\\nthe autumn fields. Disturbed by the unrest which follows any\\nilluminating vision of ideal beauty, he asked himself almost\\nangrily, in an effort to divert his thoughts, if it were possible\\nthat he was weakening in his purpose, since he no longer found\\nthe old zest in his hatred of Fletcher. The deadness of his\\nemotions had then affected this one also--the single feeling\\nwhich he had told himself would be eternal; and the old nervous\\nthrill, so like the thrill of violent love, no longer troubled\\nhim when he chanced to meet his enemy face to face. To-day he\\nheld Will Fletcher absolutely in his hand, he knew; in a few\\nyear\\'s at most his debt to Fletcher would probably be cancelled;\\nthe man and the boy would then be held together by blood ties\\nlike two snarling hounds in the leash--and yet, when all was\\nsaid, what would the final outcome yield of satisfaction? As he\\nput the question he knew that he could meet it only by evasion,\\nand his inherited apathy enfeebled him even while he demanded an\\nanswer of himself.\\n\\nAs the months went on, his indifference to success or failure\\npervaded him like a physical lethargy, and he played his game so\\nrecklessly at last that he sometimes caught himself wondering if\\nit were, after all, worth a single flicker of the candle. He\\nstill saw Will Fletcher daily; but when the spring came he ceased\\nconsciously, rather from weariness than from any nobler\\nsentiment, to exert an influence which he felt to be harmful to\\nthe boy. For four years he had wrought tirelessly to compass the\\nruin of Fletcher\\'s ambition; and now, when he had but to stretch\\nforth his arm for the final blow, he admitted impatiently that\\nwhat he lacked was the impulsive energy the deed required.\\n\\nHe was still in this mood when, one afternoon in April, as he was\\ndriving his oxen to the store, he met Fletcher in the road behind\\nthe pair of bays. At sight of him the old man\\'s temper slipped\\ncontrol, and at the end of a few minutes they were quarrelling as\\nto who should be the one to turn aside.\\n\\n\"Git out of the road, will you?\" cried Fletcher, half rising from\\nhis seat and jerking at the reins until the horses reared. \"Drive\\nyour brutes into the bushes and let me pass!\"\\n\\n\"If you think I\\'m going to swerve an inch out of my road to\\noblige you, Bill Fletcher, you are almost as big a fool as you\\nare a rascal,\" replied Christopher in a cool voice, as he brought\\nhis team to a halt and placed himself at the head of it with his\\nlong rawhide whip in his hand.\\n\\nAs he stood there he had the appearance of taking his time as\\nlightly as did the Olympian deities; and it was clear that he\\nwould wait patiently until the sun set and rose again rather than\\nyield one jot or tittle of his right upon the muddy road. While\\nhe gazed placidly over Fletcher\\'s head into the golden distance,\\nhe removed his big straw hat and began fanning his heated face.\\n\\nThere followed a noisy upbraiding from Fletcher, which ended by\\nhis driving madly into the underbrush and almost overturning the\\nheavy carriage. As he passed, he leaned from his seat and slashed\\nhis whip furiously into Christopher\\'s face; then he drove on at a\\nwild pace, bringing the horses in a shiver, and flecked with\\nfoam, into the gravelled drive before the Hall.\\n\\nThe bright flower-beds and the calm white pillars were all in\\nsunshine, and Miss Saidie, with a little, green wateringpot in\\nher hand, was sprinkling a tub of crocuses beside the steps.\\n\\n\"You look flustered, Brother Bill,\" she observed, as Fletcher\\nthrew the reins to a Negro servant and came up to where she\\nstood.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve just had some words with that darned Blake,\" returned\\nFletcher, chewing the end of his mustache, as he did when he was\\nin a rage. \"I met him as I drove up the road and he had the\\nimpudence to keep his ox-cart standing plumb still while I tore\\nthrough the briers. It\\'s the third time this thing has happened,\\nand I\\'ll be even with him for it yet.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure he must be a very rude person,\" remarked Miss Saidie,\\npinching off a withered blossom and putting it in her pocket to\\nkeep from throwing it on the trim grass. \"For my part, I\\'ve never\\nbeen able to see what satisfaction people git out of being\\nill-mannered. It takes twice as long as it does to be polite, and\\nit\\'s not nearly so good for the digestion afterward.\"\\n\\nFletcher listened to her with a scowl. \"Well, if you ever get\\nanything but curses from Christopher Blake, I\\'d like to hear of\\nit,\" he said, with a coarse laugh.\\n\\nWhy, he was really quite civil to me the other day when I passed\\nhim,\" replied Miss Saidie, facing Fletcher with her hand resting\\non the belt of her apron. \"I was in the phaeton, and he got down\\noff his wagon and picked up my whip. I declare, it almost took my\\nbreath away, but when I thanked him he raised his hat and spoke\\nvery pleasantly.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you and your everlasting excuses!\" sneered Fletcher, going\\nup the steps and turning on the porch to look down upon her. \"I\\ntell you I\\'ve had as many of \\'em as I\\'m going to stand. This is\\nmy house, and what I say in it has got to be the last word. If\\nyou squirt any more of that blamed water around here the place\\nwill rot to pieces under our very feet.\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie placed her watering-pot on the step and lifted to him\\nthe look of amiable wonder which he found more irritating than a\\nsharp retort.\\n\\n\"I forgot to tell you that Susan Spade has been waiting to speak\\nto you,\" she remarked, as if their previous conversation had been\\nof the friendliest nature.\\n\\n\"Oh, drat her! What does she want?\"\\n\\n\"She wouldn\\'t tell me--it was for you alone, she said. That was a\\ngood half-hour ago, and she\\'s been waiting in your setting-room\\never sence. She\\'s such a sharp-tongued woman I wonder how Tom\\nmanages to put up with her.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if he does, I won\\'t,\" growled Fletcher, as he went in to\\nmeet his visitor.\\n\\nMrs. Spade, wearing a severe manner and a freshly starched purple\\ncalico, was sitting straight and stiff on the edge of the\\ncretonne-covered lounge, and as he entered she rose to receive\\nhim with a visible unbending of her person. She was a lank woman,\\nwith a long, scrawny figure which appeared to have run entirely\\nto muscle, and very full skirts that always sagged below the\\nbelt-line in the back. Her face was like that of a man--\\nlarge-featured, impressive, and not without a ruddy masculine\\ncomeliness.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my duty that\\'s brought me, Mr. Fletcher,\" she began, as\\nthey shook hands. \"You kin see very well yo\\'self that it\\'s not a\\npleasure, as far as that goes, for if it had been I never should\\nhave come-not if I yearned and pined till I was sore. I never saw\\na pleasure in my life that didn\\'t lead astray, an\\' I\\'ve got the\\neye of suspicion on the most harmless-lookin\\' one that goes. As I\\ntell Tom--though he won\\'t believe it--the only way to be sartain\\nyou\\'re followin\\' yo\\' duty in this world is to find out the thing\\nyou hate most to do an\\' then do it with all yo\\' might. That rule\\nhas taken me through life, suh: it married me to Tom Spade, an\\'\\nit\\'s brought me here to-day. \\'Don\\'t you go up thar blabbin\\' on\\nWill Fletcher,\\' said Tom, when I was tyin\\' on my bonnet. \\'You\\nneedn\\'t say one word mo\\' about it,\\' was my reply. \\'I know the\\nLord\\'s way, an\\' I know mine. I\\'ve wrastled with this in pra\\'r,\\nan\\' I tell you when the Lord turns anybody\\'s stomach so dead agin\\na piece of business, it means most likely that it\\'s the very\\nthing they\\'ve got to swallow down.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Will!\" gasped Fletcher, dropping suddenly into his armchair.\\n\"Please come to the point at once, ma\\'am, and let me hear what\\nthe rascal has done last.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m comin\\', suh; I\\'m comin\\',\" Mrs. Spade hastened to assure him.\\n\"Yes, Tom an\\' I hev talked it all down to the very bone, but I\\nwouldn\\'t trust a man\\'s judgment on morals any mo\\' than I would on\\nmatchin\\' calico. Right an\\' wrong don\\'t look the same to \\'em by\\nlamplight as they do by day, an\\' if thar conscience ain\\'t set\\nplum\\' in the pupils of thar eyes, I don\\'t know whar \\'tis, that\\'s\\nsho\\'. But, thank heaven, I ain\\'t one of those that\\'s always\\nfindin\\' an excuse for people--not even if the backslider be my\\nown husband. Thar\\'s got to be some few folks on the side of\\ndecency, an\\' I\\'m one of \\'em. Virtue\\'s a slippery thing--that\\'s\\nhow I look at it--an\\' if you don\\'t git a good grip on it an\\'\\nwatch it with a mighty stern eye it\\'s precious apt to wriggle\\nthrough yo\\' fingers. I\\'m an honest woman, Mr. Fletcher, an\\' I\\nwouldn\\'t blush to own it in the presence of the King of England\\n\\n\"Great Scott!\" exclaimed Fletcher, with a brutal laugh; \"do you\\nmean to tell me the precious young fool has fallen in love with\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"Me, suh? If he had, a broomstick an\\' a spar\\' rib or so would\\nhave been all you\\'d ever found of him agin. I\\'ve never yit laid\\neyes on the man I couldn\\'t settle with a single sweep, an\\' when a\\nlone woman comes to wantin\\' a protector, I\\'ve never seen the\\nhusband that could hold a candle to a good stout broom. That\\'s\\nwhat I said to Jinnie when she got herself engaged to Fred\\nBoxley. \\'Married or single,\\' I said, \\'gal, wife, or widow, a\\nbroom is yo\\' best friend.\\'\"\\n\\nFletcher twisted impatiently in his chair.\\n\\n\"Oh, for heaven\\'s sake, stop your drivelling,\" he blurted out at\\nlast, \"and tell me in plain language what the boy has done.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know what he\\'s done or what he hasn\\'t,\" rejoined\\nMrs. Spade, \"but I\\'ve watched him courtin\\' Molly Peterkin till I\\ntold Tom this thing had to stop or I would stop it. If thar\\'s a\\np\\'isonous snake or lizard in this country, suh, it\\'s that\\ntow-headed huzzy of Sol Peterkin\\'s; an\\' if thar\\'s a sex on this\\nearth that I ain\\'t go no patience with, it\\'s the woman sex. A man\\nmay slip an\\' slide a little because he was made that way, but\\nwhen it comes to a woman she\\'s got to w\\'ar whalebones in her\\nclothes when I\\'m aroun\\'. Lord! Lord! What\\'s the use of bein\\'\\nhonest if you can\\'t p\\'int yo\\' finger at them that ain\\'t? Virtue\\ngits mighty little in the way of gewgaws in this world, an\\' I\\nreckon it\\'s got to make things up in the way it feels when it\\nlooks at them that\\'s gone astray--\"\\n\\n\"Molly Peterkin!\" gasped Fletcher, striking the arm of his chair\\na blow that almost shattered it. \"Christopher Blake was bad\\nenough, and now it\\'s Molly Peterkin! Out of the frying-pan right\\nspang into the fire. Oh, you did me a good turn in coming, Mrs.\\nSpade. I\\'ll forgive you the news you brought, and I\\'ll even\\nforgive you your blasted chatter. How long has this thing been\\ngoing on, do you know?\"\\n\\n\"That I don\\'t, suh, that I don\\'t; though I\\'ve been pryin\\' an\\'\\npeekin\\' mighty close. All I know is, that every blessed evenin\\'\\nfor the last two weeks I\\'ve seen \\'em walkin\\' together in the lane\\nthat leads to Sol\\'s. This here ain\\'t goin\\' to keep up one day\\nmo\\'; that\\'s what I put my foot down on yestiddy. I\\'d stop it if I\\ndidn\\'t have nothin\\' agin that gal but the colour of her hair. I\\ndon\\' know how \\'tis, suh, but I\\'ve always had the feelin\\' that\\nthar\\'s somethin\\' indecent about yaller hair, an\\' if I\\'d been born\\nwith it I\\'d have stuck my head into a bowl of pitch befo\\' I\\'d\\nhave gone flauntin\\' those corn-tassels in the eyes of every man I\\nmet. Thar\\'s nothin\\' in the looks of me that\\'s goin\\' to make a man\\nregret he\\'s got a wife if I can help it; an\\' mark my word, Mr.\\nFletcher, if they had dyed Molly Peterkin\\'s hair black she might\\nhave been a self-respectin\\' woman an\\' a hater of men this very\\nday. A light character an\\' a light head go precious well\\ntogether, an\\' when you set one a good sober colour the other\\'s\\npretty apt to follow.\"\\n\\nFletcher rose from his chair and stood gripping the table hard.\\n\\n\"Have you any reason to think--does it look likely--that young\\nBlake has had a hand in this?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Who? Mr. Christopher? Why, I don\\'t believe he could tell a\\npetticoat from a pair of breeches to save his soul. He ain\\'t got\\nno fancy for corn-tassels and blue ribbons, I kin tell you that.\\nIt\\'s good honest women that are the mothers of families that he\\ntakes to, an\\' even then it ain\\'t no mo\\' than \\'How are you, Mrs.\\nSpade? A fine mornin\\'!\\'\"\\n\\n\"Well, thar\\'s one thing you may be sartain of,\" returned\\nFletcher, breaking in upon her, \"and that is that this whole\\nbusiness is as good as settled. I leave here with the boy\\nto-morrow morning at sunrise, and he doesn\\'t set foot agin in\\nthis county until he\\'s gone straight through the university. I\\'ll\\ndrag him clean across the broad ocean before he shall do it.\"\\n\\nThen, as Mrs. Spade took a noisy departure, he stood, without\\nlistening to her, gazing morosely down upon the pattern of the\\ncarpet.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. The Happiness of Tucker\\n\\nEarly in the following November, Jim Weatherby, returning from\\nthe cross-roads one rainy afternoon, brought Christopher a long,\\nwailing letter from Will.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve had to walk a chalk-line, sure enough,\" he wrote,\\n\"since that awful day we left home in a pouring rain, with\\ngrandpa wearing a whole thunderstorm on his forehead. It has been\\ncram, cram, cram ever since, I can tell you, and here I am now,\\njust started at the university, with my head still buzzing with\\nthe noise of those confounded ancients. If grandpa hadn\\'t gone\\nwhen he did, I declare I believe he would have ended by driving\\nme clean crazy. Since he left I\\'ve had time to take a look about\\nme, and I find there\\'s a good deal of fun to be got here, after\\nall. How I\\'ll manage to mix it in with Greek I don\\'t see, but\\nluck\\'s with me, you know--I\\'ve found that out--so I shan\\'t\\nbother.\\n\\n\"By the way, I wish you would make Molly Peterkin understand how\\nit was I came away so hastily. Tell her I haven\\'t forgotten her,\\nand give her the little turquoise pin I\\'m sending. It just\\nmatches her eyes. Be sure to let me know if she\\'s as pretty as\\never.\"\\n\\nBy the next mail the turquoise brooch arrived, and Christopher,\\nputting it in his pocket, went over to Sol Peterkin\\'s to bear the\\nmessage to the girl. As it happened, she was swinging on the\\nlittle sagging gate when he came up the lane, and at sight of him\\nher eyebrows shot up under her flaxen curls, which hung low upon\\nher forehead. She was a pretty, soulless little animal, coloured\\nlike peach-blossoms, and with a great deal of that soft\\ninsipidity which is usually found in a boy\\'s ideal of maiden\\ninnocence.\\n\\n\"Why, I couldn\\'t believe my eyes when I first saw you,\" she said,\\narranging her curls over her left shoulder with a conscious\\nsimper.\\n\\nThe old Blake gallantry rose to meet her challenging eyes, and he\\nregarded her smilingly a moment before he answered.\\n\\n\"Well, I could hardly believe mine, you know,\" he responded\\ncarelessly. \"I thought for an instant that a big butterfly had\\nalighted on the gate.\"\\n\\nShe pouted prettily.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you come in?\" she asked after a moment, with an\\nembarrassed air, as she remembered that he was one of the \"real\\nBlakes\" for whom her father used to work.\\n\\nA light retort was on his lips, but while he looked at her a\\nlittle weary frown darkened her shallow eyes, and with the\\npeculiar sympathy for all those oppressed by man or nature which\\nwas but one expression of his many-sided temperament he quickly\\nchanged the tone of his reply. At the instant it seemed to him\\nthat Molly Peterkin and himself stood together defrauded of their\\nrightful heritage of life; and as his thought broadened he felt\\nsuddenly the pathos of her forlorn little figure, of her foolish\\nblue eyes, of her trivial vanities, of her girlish beauty, soiled\\nand worn by common handling. A look very like compassion was in\\nhis face, and the girl, seeing it, reddened angrily and kicked at\\na loose pebble in the path. When he went away a moment later he\\nleft a careless message for Sol about the tobacco crop, and the\\nlittle white box containing the turquoise brooch was still in his\\npocket.\\n\\nThat afternoon the trinket went back to Will with a curt letter.\\n\"If you take my advice, you\\'ll leave Molly Peterkin alone,\" he\\nwrote in his big, unformed hand, \"for as far as I can see you are\\ntoo good a match to get on well together. She\\'s a fool, you know,\\nand from the way you\\'re going on just now it looks very much as\\nif you were one also. At any rate, I\\'m not your man for\\ngallantries. I\\'d rather hunt hares than women, any day--and\\ngame\\'s plentiful just now.\"\\n\\nIt was a long winter that year, and for the first time since her\\nterrible illness Mrs. Blake was forced to keep her bed during a\\nbitter spell of weather, when the raw winds whistled around the\\nlittle frame house, entering the cracks at the doors and the\\nloosened sashes of the windows. Cynthia grew drawn and pinched\\nwith a sickly, frost-bitten look, and even Lila\\'s rare bloom\\ndrooped for a while like that of a delicate plant starving for\\nthe sunshine. Christopher, who, as usual, was belated in his\\nwinter\\'s work, was kept busy hauling and chopping wood,\\nshovelling the snow away from the porch and the paths that led to\\nthe well, the stable, and the barn. Once a day, most often after\\nbreakfast, Jim Weatherby appeared, smiling gaily beneath his\\npowdering of snow; and sometimes, in defiance of Cynthia, he\\nwould take Lila for a sleigh-ride, from which she would return\\nblossoming like a rose.\\n\\nMrs. Blake, from her tester bed, complained bitterly of the cold,\\nand drew from the increasing severity of the winters, which she\\ndeclared became more unbearable each year, warrant for her belief\\nin the gradual \"decline of the world as a dwelling-place.\"\\n\\n\"You may say what you please, Tucker,\" she remarked one morning\\nwhen she had awakened with an appetite to find that her eggs had\\nfrozen in the kitchen, \"but you can hardly be so barefaced as to\\ncompliment this weather. I\\'m sure I never felt anything like it\\nwhen I was young.\"\\n\\n\"Well, at least I have a roof over my head now, and I didn\\'t when\\nI marched to Romney with old Stonewall,\" remarked Tucker from the\\nhearth, where he was roasting an apple before the big logs.\\n\"Many\\'s the morning I waked then with the snow frozen stiff all\\nover me, and I had to crack through it before I could get up.\"\\n\\nThe old lady made a peevish gesture.\\n\\n\"It may sound ungrateful,\" she returned, \"but I\\'m sometimes\\ntempted to wish that you had never marched to Romney, or that\\nGeneral Jackson had been considerate enough to choose a milder\\nspell. I really believe when you come to die you will console\\nyourself with the recollection of something worse that happened\\nin the war.\"\\n\\nTucker laughed softly to himself as he watched the apple\\nrevolving in the red heat on its bit of string. \"Well, I\\'m not\\nsure that I shan\\'t, Lucy,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Habit\\'s mighty strong, you know, and when you come to think of\\nit there\\'s some comfort in knowing that you\\'ll never have to face\\nthe worst again. A man doesn\\'t duck his head at the future when\\nhe\\'s learned that, let be what will; it can\\'t be so bad as the\\nthing he\\'s gone through with and yet come out on top. It gives\\nhim a pretty good feeling, after all, to know that he hasn\\'t\\nfunked the hardest knock that life could give. Well, my birds are\\nhungry, I reckon, and I\\'ll hobble out and feed \\'em while this\\napple is roasting to the core.\"\\n\\nRaising himself with difficulty, he got upon his crutches and\\nwent to scatter his crumbs from the kitchen window.\\n\\nBy the first of March the thaw came, and the snow melted in a day\\nbeneath the lavish spring sunshine. It was a week later that\\nChristopher, coming from the woods at midday, saw Tucker sitting\\non his old bench by the damask rose-bush, in which the sap was\\njust beginning to swell. The sun shone full on the dead grass,\\nand the old soldier, with his chin resting in the crook of his\\ncrutch, was gazing straight down upon the earth. The expression\\nof his large, kindly face was so radiant with enjoyment that\\nChristopher quickened his steps and slapped him affectionately\\nupon the shoulder.\\n\\n\"Is Fletcher dead, Uncle Tucker?\" he inquired, laughing.\\n\\n\"No, no; nobody\\'s dead that I\\'ve heard of,\" responded Tucker in\\nhis cheerful voice; \"but something better than Bill Fletcher\\'s\\ndeath has happened, I can tell you. Why, I\\'d been sitting out\\nhere an hour or more, longing for the spring to come, when\\nsuddenly I looked down and there was the first dandelion--a\\nregular miracle--blooming in the mould about that old rose-bush.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll be hanged!\" exclaimed Christopher, aghast. \"Mark my\\nwords, you\\'ll be in an asylum yet.\"\\n\\nThe other chuckled softly.\\n\\n\"When you put me there you\\'ll shut up the only wise man in the\\ncounty,\" he returned. \"If your sanity doesn\\'t make you happy, I\\ncan tell you it\\'s worth a great deal less than my craziness. Look\\nat that dandelion, now--it has filled two hours chock full of\\nthought and colour for me when I might have been puling indoors\\nand nagging at God Almighty about trifles. The time has been when\\nI\\'d have walked right over that little flower and not seen it,\\nand now it grows yellower each minute that I look at it, and each\\nminute I see it better than I did the one before. There\\'s nothing\\nin life, when you come to think of it--not Columbus setting out\\nto sea nor Napoleon starting on a march--more wonderful than that\\nbrave little blossom putting up the first of all through the\\nearth.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see anything in a dandelion but a nuisance,\" observed\\nChristopher, sitting down on the bench and baring his head to the\\nsunshine; \"but you do manage to get interest out of life, that\\'s\\ncertain.\"\\n\\n\"Interest! Good Lord!\" exclaimed Tucker. \"If a man can\\'t find\\nsomething to interest him in a world like this, he must be a dull\\nfellow or else have a serious trouble of the liver. So long as I\\nhave my eyes, and there\\'s a different sky over my head each day,\\nand earth, and trees, and flowers all around me, I don\\'t reckon\\nI\\'ll begin to whistle to boredom. If I were like Lucy, now, I\\nsometimes think things would be up with me, and yet Lucy is one\\nof the very happiest women I\\'ve ever known. Her brain is so\\nfilled with pleasant memories that it\\'s never empty for an\\ninstant.\"\\n\\nChristopher\\'s face softened, as it always did at an allusion to\\nhis mother\\'s blindness.\\n\\n\"You\\'re right,\" he said; \"she is happy.\"\\n\\n\"To be sure, she\\'s had her life,\" pursued Tucker, without\\nnoticing him. \"She\\'s been a beauty, a belle, a sweetheart, a\\nwife, and a mother--to say nothing of a very spoiled old woman;\\nbut all the same, I don\\'t think I have her magnificent patience.\\nOh, I couldn\\'t sit in the midst of all this and not have eyes to\\nsee.\"\\n\\nWith a careless smile Christopher glanced about him--at the\\nbright blue sky seen through the bare trees, at the dried carrot\\nflowers in the old field across the road, at the great pine\\ngrowing on the little knoll.\\n\\n\"I hardly think she misses much,\" he said, and added after a\\nmoment, \"Do you know I\\'d give twenty--no forty, fifty years of\\nthis for a single year of the big noisy world over there. I\\'m\\ndog-tired of stagnation.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s natural,\" admitted Tucker gently. \"At your age I\\ndoubtless felt the same. The young want action, and they ought to\\nhave it, because it makes the quiet of middle age seem all the\\nsweeter. You\\'ve missed your duels and your flirtations and your\\npomades, and you\\'ve been put into breeches and into philosophy at\\nthe same time. Why, one might as well stick a brier pipe in the\\nmouth of a boy who is crying for his first gun and tell him to go\\nsit in the chimney-corner and be happy. When I was twenty-five I\\ntravelled all the way to New York for the latest Parisian\\nwaistcoat, but I can\\'t remember that I ever strolled round the\\ncorner to see a peach-tree in full bloom. I\\'m a lot happier now,\\nheaven knows, in my homespun coat, than I was then in that\\nwaistcoat of satin brocade, so I sometimes catch myself wishing\\nthat I could see again the people I knew then--the men I\\nquarrelled with and the women I kissed. I\\'d like to apologise for\\nthe young fool of thirty years ago.\"\\n\\nChristopher stirred restlessly, and, clasping his hands behind\\nhis head, stared at a small white cloud drifting slowly above the\\ngreat pine.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s the fool part I envy you, all the same,\" he remarked.\\n\\n\"You\\'re welcome to it, my boy,\" answered Tucker; then he paused\\nabruptly and bent his ear. \"Ah, there\\'s the bluebird! Do you hear\\nhim whistling in the meadow? God bless him; he\\'s a hearty fellow\\nand has spring in his throat.\"\\n\\n\"I passed one coming up,\" said Christopher.\\n\\n\"The same, I reckon. He\\'ll be paying me a visit soon, and I\\'ve\\ngot my crumbs ready.\" He smiled brightly and then sat with his\\nchin on his crutch, looking steadily across the road. \"You\\nhaven\\'t had your chance, my boy,\" he resumed presently; \"and a\\nman ought to have several chances to look round him in this\\nworld, for otherwise the things he misses will always seem to him\\nthe only things worth having. I\\'m not much of a fellow to preach,\\nyou\\'ll say--a hundred and eighty pounds of flesh that can\\'t dress\\nitself nor hobble about without crutches that are strapped on-\\n-but if it\\'s the last word I speak I wouldn\\'t change a day in my\\nlong life, and if it came to going over it again I\\'d trust it all\\nin the Lord\\'s hands and start blindfolded. And yet, when I look\\nback upon it now, I see that it wasn\\'t much of a life as lives\\ngo, and the two things I wanted most in it I never got.\"\\n\\nChristopher turned quickly with a question.\\n\\n\"Oh, you think I have always been a contented, prosaic chap,\"\\npursued Tucker, smiling, \"but you were never more mistaken since\\nyou were born. Twice in my life I came mighty near blowing out my\\nbrains--once when I found that I couldn\\'t go to Paris and be an\\nartist, and the second time when I couldn\\'t get the woman I\\nwanted for my wife. I wasn\\'t cut out for a farmer, you see, and I\\nhad always meant from the time I was a little boy to go abroad\\nand study painting. I\\'d set my heart on it, as people say, but\\nwhen the time came my father died and I had to stay at home to\\nsquare his debts and run the place. For a single night I was as\\nclean crazy as a man ever was. It meant the sacrifice of my\\ncareer, you know, and a career seemed a much bigger thing to me\\nthen than it does to-day.\"\\n\\n\"I never heard that,\" said Christopher, lowering his voice.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a lot we don\\'t know even about the people we live in a\\nlittle house with. You never heard, either, I dare say, that I\\nwas so madly in love once that when the woman threw me over for a\\nbetter man I shut myself up in a cabin in the woods and did not\\nspeak to a human being for six months. I was a rare devil, sure\\nenough, though you\\'d never believe it to see me now. It took two\\nblows like that, a four years\\' war, and the surgeon\\'s operating\\ntable to teach me how to be happy.\"\\n\\n\"It was Miss Matoaca Bolling, I suppose?\" suggested Christopher,\\nwith a mild curiosity.\\n\\nThe old soldier broke into his soft, full laugh.\\n\\n\"Matoaca! Bless your soul, no. But to think that Lucy should have\\nkept a secret for more than thirty years! Never talk to me again\\nabout a woman\\'s letting anything out. If she\\'s got a secret that\\nit mortifies her to tell it will be buried in the grave with her,\\nand most likely it will never see the light at judgment Day. Lucy\\nwas always ashamed of my being jilted, you know.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a new story then, is it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s as old as the hills by now. What\\'s the funny part,\\nthough, is that Lucy has always tried to persuade herself it was\\nreally Matoaca I cared for. You know, I sometimes think that a\\nwoman can convince herself that black is white if she only keeps\\ntrying hard enough--and it\\'s marvellous that she never sees the\\ndifference between wanting to believe a thing and believing it in\\nearnest. Now, if Matoaca had been the last woman on this earth,\\nand I the last man, I could never have fallen in love with her,\\nthough I may as well confess that I had my share of fancies when\\nI was young. It\\'s no use attempting to explain a man\\'s feelings,\\nof course. Matoaca was almost as great a belle as Lucy, and she\\nwas the handsomest creature you ever laid eyes on--one of those\\nbig, managing women who are forever improving things around them.\\nWhy, I don\\'t believe she could stay two seconds in a man\\'s arms\\nwithout improving the set of his cravat. Some men like that kind\\nof thing, but I never did, and I often think the reason I went so\\nmad about the other woman was that she came restful after\\nMatoaca. She was the comforting kind, who, you might be sure,\\nalways saw you at your best; and no matter the mood you were in,\\nshe never wanted to pat and pull you into shape. Lucy always said\\nshe couldn\\'t hold a candle to Matoaca in looks, and I suppose she\\nwas right; but, pretty or plain, that girl had something about\\nher that went straight to my heart more than thirty years ago and\\nstays there still. Strange to say, I\\'ve tried to believe that it\\nwas half compassion, for she always reminded me of a little wild\\nbird that somebody had caught and shut up in a cage, and it used\\nto seem to me sometimes that I could almost hear the fluttering\\nof her soul. Well, whatever it was, the feeling was the sort that\\nis most worth while, though she didn\\'t think so, of course, and\\nbroke her great heart over another man. She married him and had\\nsix children and died a few years ago. He was a fortunate fellow,\\nI suppose, and yet I can\\'t help fancying that I\\'ve had the better\\npart and the Lord was right. She was not happy, they said, and he\\nknew it, and yet had to face those eyes of hers every day. It was\\nlike many other marriages, I reckon; he got used to her body and\\nnever caught so much as a single glimpse of her soul. Then she\\nfaded away and died to him, but to me she\\'s just the same as when\\nI first saw her, and I still believe that if she could come here\\nand sit on this old bench I should be perfectly happy. It\\'s a\\nlucky man, I tell you, who can keep the same desire for more than\\nthirty years.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head slowly, smiling as he listened to the bluebird\\nsinging in the road. \"And now I\\'ll be fetching my crumbs,\" he\\nadded, struggling to his crutches.\\n\\nWhen he had helped Tucker to the house, Christopher came back and\\nsat down again on the bench, closing his eyes to the sunshine,\\nthe spring sky, and the dandelion blooming in the mould. He was\\nvery tired, and his muscles ached from the strain of heavy\\nlabour, yet as he lingered there in the warm wind it seemed to\\nhim that action was the one thing he desired. The restless season\\nworked in his blood, and he felt the stir of old impulses that\\nhad revived each year with the quickening sap since the first\\npilgrimage man made on earth. He wanted to be up and away while\\nhe was still young, and his heart beat high, and at the moment he\\nwould have found positive delight in any convulsion of the\\nnatural order, in any excuse for a headlong and impetuous plunge\\ninto life.\\n\\nHe heard the door open again, and Tucker shuffled out into the\\npath and began scattering his crumbs upon the gravel. When\\nChristopher passed a moment later, on his way to the house, the\\nold soldier was merrily whistling an invitation to a glimpse of\\nblue in a tree-top by the road.\\n\\nThe spring dragged slowly, and with June came the transplanting\\nof the young tobacco. This was the busiest season of the year\\nwith Christopher, and so engrossed was he in his work that for a\\nweek at the end of the month he did not go down for the county\\nnews at Tom Spade\\'s store. Fletcher was at home, he knew, but he\\nhad heard nothing of Will, and it was through the storekeeper at\\nlast that he learned definitely of the boy\\'s withdrawal from the\\nuniversity. Returning from the field one afternoon at sunset, he\\nsaw Tom sitting beside Tucker in the yard, and in response to a\\ngesture he crossed the grass and stopped beside the long pine\\nbench.\\n\\n\"I say, Mr. Christopher, I\\'ve brought you a bit of news,\" called\\nthe storekeeper at the young man\\'s approach.\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s have it,\" returned Christopher, laughing. \"If you\\'re\\ngoing to tell me that Uncle Tucker has discovered a rare weed,\\nthough, I warn you that I can\\'t support it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not in this, thank heaven,\" protested Tucker; \"but to\\ntell the truth, I\\'m downright sorry for the boy--Fletcher or no\\nFletcher,\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Christopher under his breath, \"so it\\'s Will Fletcher?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s in a jolly scrape this time, an\\' no mistake,\" replied Tom.\\n\"He\\'s been leadin\\' a wild life at the university, it seems, an\\'\\nto-day Fletcher got a telegram saying that the boy had been\\ncaught cheatin\\' in his examinations. The old man left on the next\\ntrain, as mad as a hornet, I can tell you. He swore he\\'d bring\\nthe young scamp back an\\' put him to the plough. Well, well, thar\\nare worse dangers than a pretty gal, though Susan won\\'t believe\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"Then he\\'ll bring him home?\" asked Christopher, blinking in the\\nsunlight. At the instant it seemed to him that sky and field\\nwhirled rapidly before his eyes, and a strange noise started in\\nhis ears which he found presently to be the throbbing of his\\narteries.\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s been given a hard push down the wrong road,\" answered\\nTom, \"an\\' it\\'s more than likely he\\'ll never pull up till he gits\\nclean to the bottom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. The Wages of Folly\\n\\nTwo days later Fletcher\\'s big new carriage crawled over the muddy\\nroad, and Christopher, looking up from his work in the field,\\ncaught a glimpse of the sullen face Will turned on the familiar\\nlandscape. The younger Fletcher had come home evidently nursing a\\ngrievance at his heart; his eyes held a look of dogged\\nresentment, and the hand in which he grasped the end of the linen\\ndust-robe was closed in an almost convulsive grip. When he met\\nChristopher\\'s gaze he glanced angrily away without speaking, and\\nthen finding himself face to face with his grandfather\\'s scowl he\\njerked impatiently in the opposite direction. It was clear that\\nthe tussle of wills had as yet wrung only an enforced submission\\nfrom the younger man.\\n\\nLifting his head, Christopher stood idly watching the carriage\\nuntil it disappeared between the rows of flowering chestnuts;\\nthen, returning in a half-hearted fashion to his work, he found\\nhimself wondering curiously if Fletcher\\'s wrath and Will\\'s\\nindiscretions were really so great as public rumour might lead\\none to suppose.\\n\\nAn answer to his question came the next evening, when he heard a\\nlight, familiar whistle outside the stable where he was at work,\\nand a moment afterward Will appeared in the shadow of the\\ndoorway.\\n\\n\"So it wasn\\'t a cut, after all?\" said Christopher with a laugh,\\nas he held out his hand.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be hanged if I know what it was,\" was Will\\'s response,\\nturning away after a limp grasp and seating himself upon the big\\nbox in the corner. \"To tell the truth, grandpa has put me into\\nsuch a fluster that I hardly know my head from my heels. There\\'s\\none thing certain, though; if he doesn\\'t take his eye off me for\\na breathing space he\\'ll send me to the dogs before he knows it.\"\\n\\nHis face had lost its boyish freshness of complexion and his weak\\nmouth had settled into lines of sullen discontent. Even his dress\\ndisplayed the carelessness which is one of the outward marks of a\\ndisordered mind, and his bright blue tie was loosely knotted in\\nunequal lengths.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the trouble now?\" demanded Christopher, coming from the\\nstall and hanging his lantern from a nail beside the ladder,\\nwhere the light fell full on Will\\'s face. \"Out with it and have\\ndone. I thought yesterday that you had been driving a hard\\nbargain with the old man on my account.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not you this time, thank heaven,\" returned Will. \"It\\'s\\nall about that confounded scrape I got into at the university. I\\ntold him it would mean trouble if he sent me there, but he would\\ndo it whether or no. He dragged me away from here, you remember,\\nand had me digging at my books with a scatter-brained tutor for a\\ngood six months; then when I knew just about enough to start at\\nthe university he hauled me there with his own hands and kept\\nwatch over me for several weeks. I\\'m quick at most things like\\nthat, so after he went away I thought I\\'d have a little fun and\\ntrust luck to make it up to me at the end--but it all went\\nagainst me somehow, and then they stirred up that blamed rumpus\\nabout the examinations.\"\\n\\nYawning more in disgust than in drowsiness, he struck a match on\\nthe edge of the box and lighted a cigarette. His flippant manner\\nwas touched with the conscious resentment which still lingered in\\nhis eyes, and from the beginning to the end of his account he\\nbetrayed no hint of a regret for his own shabby part in the\\naffair. When it was not possible to rest the blame upon his\\ngrandfather, he merely shrugged his shoulders and lightly tossed\\nthe responsibility to fate.\\n\\n\"This is one of the things I daren\\'t do at the house,\" he\\nremarked after a moment, inhaling a cloud of smoke and blowing it\\nin spirals through his nostrils; \"the old man won\\'t tolerate\\nanything more decent than a pipe, unless it happens to be a chew.\\nOh, I\\'m sick to death of the whole business,\" he burst out\\nsuddenly. \"When I woke up this morning I had more than half a\\nmind to break loose and go abroad to Maria. By the way, Wyndham\\'s\\ndead, you know; he died last fall just after we went away.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, is that so!\" exclaimed Christopher. \"She\\'ll come home, then,\\nwill she?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the queer part--she won\\'t, and nobody knows why. Wyndham\\nturned out to be a regular scamp, of course; he treated her\\nabominably and all that, but he no sooner died than she turned\\nabout and picked up one of his sisters to nurse and coddle. Oh,\\nit\\'s all foolishness, but I\\'ve half a mind to run away, all the\\nsame. A life like this will drive me crazy in six months, and\\nI\\'ll be hanged if it is my fault, after all. He knew I never had\\na head for books, but he drove me at them as if I were no better\\nthan a black slave. Things have all been against me from the\\nstart, and yet I used to think that I was born to be lucky--\"\\n\\n\"What does he mean to do with you now?\" inquired Christopher.\\n\\n\"Put me to the plough, he says; but I can\\'t stand it--I haven\\'t\\nthe strength. Why, this morning he made me hang around that\\ntobacco field in the blazing sun for two mortal hours, minding\\nthose shiftless darkies. If I complain; or even go off to sit\\ndown in a bit of shade, he rushes up and blusters about kicking\\nme out of doors unless I earn my bread. Oh, his temper is simply\\nawful, and he gets worse every day. He\\'s growing stingy, too,\\nand makes us live like beggars. All the vegetables go to market\\nnow, and most of the butter, and this morning he blew Aunt\\nSaidie\\'s head off because she had spring chickens on the\\nbreakfast table. I don\\'t dare ask him for a penny, and yet he\\'s\\nrich--one of the richest men in the State, they say.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it sounds jolly,\" observed Christopher, smiling.\\n\\n\"Oh, you can\\'t imagine the state of things, and you\\'d never\\nbelieve it if I told you. It\\'s worse than any fuss you ever heard\\nof or ever saw. I used to be able to twist him round my finger,\\nyou know, and now he hates me worse than he does a snake. He\\nhasn\\'t spoken a word to me since that scene we had at the\\nuniversity, except to order me to go out and watch the Negroes\\nplant tobacco. If he finds out I want a thing he\\'ll move heaven\\nand earth to keep me from getting it--and then sit by and grin.\\nHe\\'s got a devil in him, that\\'s the truth, and there\\'s nothing to\\ndo except keep out of his way as much as possible. I\\'m patient,\\ntoo--Aunt Saidie knows it--and the only time I ever hit back was\\nwhen he jumped on you the other day. Then I got mad and struck\\nout hard, I tell you.\"\\n\\nChristopher leaned over and began buckling and unbuckling a\\nleather strap in the harness-box.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t get into hot water on my account,\" he returned; \"the more\\nhe abuses me, you know, the better I like it. But it\\'s odd that\\nafter all these years he should want to turn you into an\\noverseer.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he shan\\'t do it; that\\'s certain. It will be a cold day\\nwhen he gets me masquerading in the family character. Let him go\\njust one step too far and I\\'ll shake him off for good, and strike\\nout on a freight-train. Life couldn\\'t be any worse than it is\\nnow, and it might be a great deal better. As to my hanging round\\nlike this much longer and swearing at a pack of worthless\\ndarkies--well, it\\'s more than I bargain for, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s not much excitement in it, to be sure. I would rather be\\na freight-hand myself, I think, when all is said.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t joke. You were brought up to it and it doesn\\'t\\ncome so hard.\"\\n\\n\"Doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Not so hard as it does to me, at any rate. There\\'s got to be\\nsome dash about life, I tell you, to make it suit my taste. I\\nwasn\\'t born to settle down and count my money and my tobacco from\\nmorning till night. It\\'s spice I want in things, and--hang it! I\\ndon\\'t believe there\\'s a pretty woman in the county.\"\\n\\nFor a moment Christopher stared silently down at the matted\\nstraw. His face had grown dark, and the reckless lines about his\\nmouth became suddenly prominent.\\n\\n\"Why, where\\'s Molly Peterkin?\" he asked abruptly, with a laugh\\nthat seemed to slip from him against his will.\\n\\nThe other broke into a long whistle and tossed the end of his\\ncigarette through the doorway.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t think I\\'ve forgotten her,\" he replied; \"she\\'s the\\none bright spot I see in this barren hole. By the way, why do you\\nthink her a fool?\"\\n\\n\"Because she is one.\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'re a brute. What does a man want with brains in a woman,\\nanyway. Maria had them and they didn\\'t keep her from coming to\\nshipwreck.\"\\n\\nChristopher reached for the lantern.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve got to go now,\" he broke in, \"and you\\'d better be\\ntrotting home or you\\'ll have the old man and the hounds out after\\nyou.\"\\n\\nWith the lantern swinging from his hand, he went to the door and\\nwaited for Will; then passing out, he turned the key in the lock,\\nand with a short \"Good-night!\" started briskly toward the house.\\n\\nWill followed him to the kitchen steps, and then keeping to the\\npath that trailed across the yard, he passed through the\\nwhitewashed gate and went on along the sunken road which led by\\nthe abandoned ice-pond. Here he turned into the avenue of\\nchestnuts, and with the lighted windows of the Hall before him,\\nwalked slowly toward the impending interview with his\\ngrandfather.\\n\\nAs he entered the house, Miss Saidie looked out from the\\ndining-room doorway and beckoned in a stealthy fashion with the\\nhen-house key.\\n\\n\"He has been hunting everywhere for you,\" she whispered, \"and I\\ntold him you\\'d gone for a little stroll along the road.\"\\n\\nAn expression of anger swept over Will\\'s face, and he made a\\nhelpless gesture of revolt.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t stand it any longer,\" he answered, with a spurt of\\nresolution which was exhausted in the feeble speech.\\n\\nMiss Saidie put up her hand and straightened his necktie with an\\naffectionate pat.\\n\\n\"Only for a little while, dear,\" she urged; \"he\\'s in one of his\\nblack humours, and it will blow over, never fear. Things are\\nnever so bad but there\\'s hope of a mending some day. Try to\\nplease him and go to work as he wants you to do. It all came of\\nthe trouble at the university--he had set his heart on your\\ncarrying off the honours.\"\\n\\n\"It was his fault,\" said Will stubbornly. \"I begged him not to\\nsend me there. It was his fault.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that can\\'t be helped now,\" returned the little woman\\ndecisively. \"All we can do is to make things as easy as we can,\\nand if thar\\'s ever to be any peace in this house again you must\\ntry to humour him. I never saw him in such a state before, and\\nI\\'ve known him for sixty years and slept in a trundle-bed with\\nhim as a baby. The queerest thing about it, too, is that he seems\\nto get closer and closer every day. Just now thar was a big fuss\\nbecause I hadn\\'t sent all the fresh butter to market, and I\\nthought he\\'d have a fit when he found I was saving some asparagus\\nfor dinner to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"Where is he now?\" asked Will in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Complaining over some bills in his setting-room; and he actually\\ntold me a while ago, when I went in, that he had been a fool to\\ngive Maria so much money for Wyndham to throw away. Poor Maria!\\nI\\'m sure she has had a hard enough time without being abused for\\nsomething she couldn\\'t help. But it really is a passion with him,\\nthar\\'s no use denying it. He spends his whole time adding up the\\ncost of what we eat.\"\\n\\nThen, as the supper-bell rang in the hall, she finished\\nhurriedly, and assuming a cheerful manner, took her place behind\\nthe silver service.\\n\\nFletcher entered with a heavy step, his eyes lowering beneath his\\nbushy eyebrows. The weight of his years appeared to have fallen\\nupon him in a night, and he was no longer the hale, ruddy man of\\nmiddle age, with his breezy speeches and his occasional touches\\nof coarse humour. The untidiness of his clothes was still\\nmarked-his coat, his cravat, his finger nails, all showed the old\\nlack of neatness.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t you say grace, Brother Bill?\" asked Miss Saidie, as he\\npaused abstractedly beside his chair.\\n\\nBending his head, he mumbled a few hurried words, and then cast a\\nsuspicious glance over the long table.\\n\\n\"I told you to use the butter with onions in it,\" he said,\\nhelping himself and tasting a little on the end of his knife.\\n\"This brings forty cents a pound in market, and I\\'ll not have the\\nwaste.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Brother Bill, the other is so bad,\" gasped Miss Saidie\\nnervously.\\n\\n\"It\\'s good enough for you and me, I reckon. We wan\\'t brought up\\non any better, and what\\'s good enough for us is good enough for\\nmy grandson.\" Then he turned squarely upon Will. \"So you\\'re back,\\neh? Whar did you go?\" he demanded\\n\\nWill tried to meet his eyes, failed, and stared gloomily at the\\nwhite-and-red border of the tablecloth.\\n\\n\"I went out for a breath of air,\" he answered in a muffled voice.\\n\"It\\'s been stifling all day.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to get used to it, I reckon,\" returned the old man\\nwith a brutal laugh. \"I\\'ll have no idlers and no fancy men about\\nme.\"\\n\\nAn ugly smile distorted his coarse features, and, laying down his\\nknife and fork, he sat watching his grandson with his small,\\nbloodshot eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. The Toss of a Coin\\n\\nA fortnight passed before Will came to Christopher\\'s again, and\\nthen he stole over one evening in the shadow of the twilight.\\nThings were no better, he said; they were even worse than usual;\\nthe work in the tobacco field was simply what he couldn\\'t stand,\\nand his grandfather was growing more intolerable every day.\\nBesides this, the very dullness of the life was fast driving him\\nto distraction. He had smuggled a bottle of whisky from the town,\\nand last night, after a hot quarrel with the old man, he had\\nsucceeded in drugging himself to sleep. \"My nerves have gone all\\nto pieces,\" he finished irritably, \"and it\\'s nothing on earth but\\nthis everlasting bickering that has done it. It\\'s more than flesh\\nand blood can be expected to put up with.\"\\n\\nHis hand shook a little when he lighted a cigarette, and his\\nface, which was burned red from wind and sun, contracted\\nnervously as he talked. It was the wildness in his speech,\\nhowever, the suppressed excitement which ran in an undercurrent\\nbeneath his words, that caused the other to turn sharply and\\nregard him for a moment with gathered brows.\\n\\n\"Well, take my advice and don\\'t try that dodge too often,\"\\nremarked Christopher in a careless tone.\\n\\n\"What in the deuce does it matter?\" returned Will desperately.\\n\"It was the only quiet night I\\'ve had for three weeks: I slept\\nlike a log straight through until the breakfast-bell. Then I was\\nlate, of course, and he threatened to take an hour\\'s time from my\\nday\\'s wages. By the way, he pays me now, you know, just as he\\ndoes the other labourers.\"\\n\\nFor a time he kept up his rambling complaint, but, breaking off\\nabruptly at last, made some trivial excuse, and started homeward\\nacross the fields. Christopher, looking after him, was hardly\\nsurprised when he saw him branch off into the shaded lane that\\nled to Sol Peterkin\\'s.\\n\\nThere followed a month when the two met only at long intervals,\\nand then with a curious constraint of manner. Sometimes\\nChristopher, stopping on his way to the pasture, would exchange a\\nfew words over the rail fence with Will, who lounged on the edge\\nof his grandfather\\'s tobacco crop; but the old intimacy had\\nceased suddenly to exist, and it was evident that a newer\\ninterest had distracted the boy\\'s ardent fancy.\\n\\nIt was not until August that the meaning of the change was made\\nclear to Christopher, when, coming one day to a short turn in a\\nlittle woodland road upon his land, he saw Will and Molly\\nPeterkin sitting side by side on a fallen log. The girl had been\\ncrying, and at the sight of Christopher she gave a frightened sob\\nand pulled her blue gingham sunbonnet down over her forehead; but\\nWill, inspired at the instant by some ideal of chivalry, drew her\\nhand through his arm and came out boldly into the road.\\n\\n\"You know Molly,\" he said in a brave voice that was not without\\npathos, \"but you don\\'t know that she has promised to be my wife.\"\\n\\nWhatever the purpose of the girl\\'s tears, she had need of them no\\nlonger, for with an embarrassed little laugh she flushed and\\ndimpled into her pretty smile.\\n\\n\"Your wife?\" repeated Christopher blankly. \"Why, you\\'re no better\\nthan two children and deserve to be whipped. If I were in your\\nplace, I\\'d start to catching butterflies, and quit fooling.\"\\n\\nHe passed on laughing merrily; but before the day was over he\\nbegan to wonder seriously if Will could be really sincere in his\\nintention to marry Molly Peterkin--poor, pretty Molly, whose fame\\nwas blown to the four corners of the county.\\n\\nBy night the question had come to perplex him in earnest, and it\\nwas almost with relief that he heard a familiar rattle on his\\nwindow-pane as he undressed, and, looking out, saw Will standing\\nin the long grass by the porch.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s time you turned up,\" he said, when he had slipped\\ncautiously down the staircase and joined him in the yard.\\n\\n\"Get your lantern,\" returned Will, \"and come on to the barn.\\nThere\\'s something I must see you about at once,\" and while the\\nother went in search of the light, he stood impatiently uprooting\\na tuft of grass as he whistled a college song in unsteady tones.\\n\\nAt the end of a minute Christopher reappeared, bearing the\\nlantern, which he declared was quite unnecessary because of the\\nrising moon.\\n\\n\"Oh, but I must talk indoors,\" responded Will; \"the night makes\\nme creepy--it always did.\"\\n\\n\"So there is something to say, and it\\'s no nonsense? Are the\\nskies about to fall, or has your grandfather got a grip on his\\ntemper?\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! It\\'s not that. Wait till we get inside.\" And when they\\nhad entered the barn, he turned and carefully closed the door,\\nafter flashing the light over the trampled straw in the dusky\\ncorners. In the shed outside a new-born calf bleated plaintively,\\nand at the sound he started and broke into an apologetic laugh.\\n\"You thought I was joking to-day,\" he said suddenly.\\n\\nChristopher nodded.\\n\\n\"So I presumed,\" he answered, wondering if drink or love or both\\ntogether had produced so extreme an agitation.\\n\\n\"Well, I wasn\\'t,\" declared Will, and, placing the lantern on the\\nfloor, he raised his head to meet the other\\'s look. \"I was as\\ndead in earnest as I am this minute--and if it\\'s the last word I\\never speak, I mean to marry Molly Peterkin.\"\\n\\nHis excitable nerves were plainly on the rack of some strong\\nemotion, and as he met the blank amazement in Christopher\\'s face\\nhe turned away with a gesture of angry reproach.\\n\\n\"Then you\\'re a fool,\" said Christopher, with a shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n\\nWill quivered as if the words struck him like a whip.\\n\\n\"Because she\\'s Sol Peterkin\\'s daughter?\" he burst out.\\nChristopher smiled.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not her father, but her character, that I was thinking of,\"\\nhe answered, and the next instant fell back in sheer surprise,\\nfor Will, flinging himself recklessly upon him, struck him\\nsquarely in the mouth.\\n\\nAs they fell breathlessly apart Christopher was conscious that\\nfor the first time in his life he felt something like respect for\\nWill Fletcher--or at least for that expression of courageous\\npassion which in the vivid moments of men\\'s lives appears to\\nraise the strong and the weak alike above the ordinary level of\\ntheir surroundings. For a second he stood swallowing down the\\nanger which the blow aroused in him--an anger as purely physical\\nas the mounting of the hot blood to his cheek--then he looked\\nstraight into the other\\'s face and spoke in a pleasant voice.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon; it was all my fault,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I knew you\\'d see it,\" answered Will, appeased at once by the\\nconfession, \"and I counted on you to help us; that\\'s why I came.\"\\n\\n\"To help you?\" repeated Christopher, a little startled.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve got to be married, you know--there\\'s simply nothing\\nelse to do. All this confounded talk about Molly has come near\\nkilling her, and the poor child is afraid to look anybody in the\\nface. She\\'s so innocent, you know, that half the time she doesn\\'t\\nunderstand what their lies are all about.\"\\n\\n\"Good God!\" said Christopher beneath his breath.\\n\\n\"And besides, what use is there in waiting?\" urged Will. \"Grandpa\\nwon\\'t be any better fifty years from now than he is to-day, and\\nby that time we\\'d be old and gray-haired. This life is more than\\nI can stand, anyway, and it makes mighty little difference\\nwhether it ends one way or another. Just so I have Molly I don\\'t\\ncare much what happens. \"\\n\\n\"But you can\\'t marry--it\\'s simply out of the question. Why,\\nyou\\'re not yet twenty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we can\\'t marry here, of course, but we\\'re going on to\\nWashington to-morrow--all our plans are made, and that\\'s why I\\ncame to see you. I want to borrow your horses to take us to the\\ncrossroads at midnight. \"\\n\\nSeizing him by the shoulder, Christopher shook him roughly in a\\npowerful grasp.\\n\\n\"Wake up,\" he said impatiently; \"you are either drunk or asleep,\\nand you\\'re going headlong to the devil. If you do this thing\\nyou\\'ll be ashamed of it in two weeks.\" Then he released him,\\nlaughing as he watched him totter and regain his balance. \"But if\\nyou\\'re bent on being an ass, then, for heaven\\'s sake, go and be\\none,\" he added irritably.\\n\\nA shiver passed through Will, and he stuttered an instant before\\nhe could form his words.\\n\\n\"She told me you\\'d say that,\" he replied. \"She told me you\\'d\\nalways hated her.\"\\n\\n\"Hate her? Nonsense! She isn\\'t worth it. I\\'d as soon hate a white\\nkitten. As far as that goes, I\\'ve nothing against the girl, and I\\ndon\\'t doubt she\\'d be a much better wife than most men deserve.\\nI\\'m not prating about virtue, mind you; I\\'m only urging common\\nsense. You\\'re too young and too big a fool to marry anybody.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you disapprove of her, at any rate--you\\'re against her,\\nand that\\'s why I haven\\'t talked about her before. She\\'s the most\\nbeautiful creature alive, I tell you, and I wouldn\\'t give her up\\nif to keep her meant I\\'d be a beggar.\"\\n\\n\"It will mean that, most likely.\"\\n\\nTurning away, Will drew a small flask from his pocket and,\\nunscrewing the stopper, raised the bottle to his lips. \"I\\'d go\\nmad but for this,\" he said; \"that\\'s why I\\'ve carried it about\\nwith me for the last week. It\\'s the only thing that drives away\\nthis horrible depression.\"\\n\\nAs he drank, Christopher regarded him curiously, noting that the\\nwhisky lent animation to his face and an unnatural luster to his\\neyes. The sunburn on his forehead appeared to deepen all at once,\\nand there was a bright red flush across his cheeks.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t take my advice,\" said Christopher at last, \"but I\\ncan\\'t help telling you that unless you\\'re raving mad you\\'d better\\ndrop the whole affair as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\"Not now--not now, \" protested Will gaily, consumed by an\\nartificial energy. \"Don\\'t preach to me while the taste of a drink\\nis still in my mouth, for there\\'s no heart so strong as the one\\nwhisky puts into a man. When I feel my courage oozing from my\\nfingers I can reinforce it in less time than it takes to sneak\\naway.\"\\n\\nGrowing boisterous, he assumed a ridiculous swagger, and broke\\ninto a fragment of a college song. Until morning he would not\\nprobably become himself again, and, knowing this, Christopher\\ndesisted helplessly from his efforts at persuasion.\\n\\n\"You will lend me the horses?\" asked Will, keeping closely to his\\npoint.\\n\\n\"Are you steady enough?\"\\n\\n\"Of course--of course, \" he stretched out his hands and moved a\\npace or two away; \"and besides, Dolly drives like old Nick.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll see,\" said Christopher, and going to the window, he\\nflung back the rude shutter and looked out into the August night.\\nThe warm air touched his face like a fragrant breath, and from\\nthe darkness a big white moth flew over his shoulder to where the\\nlantern burned dimly on the floor.\\n\\n\"I may take them?\" urged Will again, pulling him by the sleeve.\\n\\nAt the words Christopher turned and walked slowly back across the\\nbarn.\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ll lend them to you,\" he answered, without meeting the\\nother\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a jolly good chap; I always knew it, \" cried Will\\nheartily. \"I\\'ll take them out at midnight, when there\\'s a good\\nmoon, and get Jerry Green to drive them back to-morrow. Hurrah!\\nIt\\'s the best night\\'s work you ever did!\"\\n\\nHe went out hurriedly, still singing his college song, and\\nChristopher, without moving from his place, stood watching the\\nbig white moth that circled dizzily about the lantern. At the\\ninstant he regretted that Will had appealed to him--regretted\\neven that he had promised him the horses. He wished it had all\\ncome about without his knowledge--that Fletcher\\'s punishment and\\nWill\\'s ruin had been wrought less directly by his own\\nintervention. Next he told himself that he would have stopped\\nthis thing had it been possible, and then with the thought he\\nbecame clearly aware that it was still in his power to prevent\\nthe marriage. He had but to walk across the fields to Fletcher\\'s\\ndoor, and before sunrise the foolish pair would be safely home\\nagain. Will would probably be sent off to recover, and Molly\\nwould go back to making butter and to flirting with Fred Turner.\\nOn the other hand, let the marriage but take place--let him keep\\nsilent until the morning--and the revenge of which he had dreamed\\nsince childhood would be accomplished at a single stroke. Bill\\nFletcher\\'s many sins would find him out in a night.\\n\\nThe big moth, fluttering aimlessly from the lantern, flew\\nsuddenly in his face, and the touch startled him from his\\nabstraction. With a laugh he shook the responsibility from his\\nshoulders, and then, as he hesitated again for a breath, the\\nracial instinct arose, as usual, to decide the issue.\\n\\nTaking a dime from his pocket, he tossed it lightly in the air\\nand waited for it to fall.\\n\\n\"Heads for me, tails for Fletcher.\"\\n\\nThe coin spun for an instant in the gloom above him and then\\ndropped noiselessly to the floor. When he lifted the lantern and\\nbent over it he saw that the head lay uppermost.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. In Which Christopher Triumphs\\n\\nWhen he entered the house a little later Cynthia met him in the\\nkitchen doorway with an anxious frown.\\n\\n\"I heard a noise, Christopher. What was it?\"\\n\\n\"A man wanted me about something. How is mother resting?\"\\n\\n\"Not well. Her dreams trouble her. She grows weaker every day,\\nand the few hours she insists upon spending in her chair tire her\\ndreadfully.\"\\n\\n\"There is nothing that she needs, you say?\"\\n\\n\"No; nothing. She has never felt our poverty for an instant.\"\\n\\nThe furrow between his eyebrows grew deeper.\\n\\n\"And you?\" he asked abruptly, regarding her fixedly with his\\nintent gaze. \"What under heaven are you up to at this hour?\"\\n\\nGlancing down at the ironing-board before her, she flushed\\npainfully through the drawn grayness of her face.\\n\\n\"I had a little ironing to do,\" she answered, \"and I wanted it\\nall finished to-night. Mother needs me in the day.\"\\n\\nPushing her aside, he seized the iron and ran it in a few hasty\\nstrokes over the rough-dry garment which she had spread on the\\nboard. \"Go to bed and leave these things alone,\" he insisted.\\n\\n\"Oh, Christopher, you\\'ll spoil it!\" cried Cynthia, clutching his\\narm.\\n\\nHe returned the iron to the stand and met her reproachful look\\nwith a gesture of annoyance. \"Well, I\\'m going to sleep, if you\\naren\\'t,\" he said, and treading as lightly as possible in his\\nheavy boots, went along the little platform and upstairs to his\\ngarret room.\\n\\nOnce inside, he undressed hastily and flung himself upon the bed,\\nbut his thoughts spun like a top, and wild visions of Will, of\\nFletcher, and of Molly Peterkin whirled confusedly through his\\nbrain. When at last he lost consciousness for a time, it was to\\ndream restlessly of the cry of a hare that the hounds had caught\\nand mangled. The scream of the creature came to him from a thick\\nwood, which was intersected by innumerable small green paths, and\\nwhen he tried vainly to go to the rescue he lost himself again\\nand again in the wilderness of trails. Back and forth he turned\\nin the twilight, crushing down the underbrush and striking in a\\nfrenzy at the forked boughs the trees wrapped about him, while\\nsuddenly the piteous voice became that of a woman in distress.\\nThen, with a great effort, he fought his way through the wood, to\\nsee the mangled hare change slowly into Maria Fletcher, who\\nopened her eyes to ask him why he hunted her to death.\\n\\nHe awoke in a cold sweat, and, sitting up in bed, leaned for air\\ntoward the open window. A dull ache gnawed at his heart, and his\\nlips were parched as if from fever. Again it seemed to him that\\nMaria entreated him across the distance.\\n\\n\\nWhen he came down at sunrise he found Jerry Green awaiting him\\nwith the horses, and learned in answer to his questions that the\\nlovers had taken a light wagon at the cross-roads and driven on\\nto town.\\n\\n\"They were that bent on gittin\\' thar that they couldn\\'t even wait\\nfor the stage, \" the man told him. \"Well, they\\'re a merry pair,\\nan\\' I hope good will come of it--seein\\' as \\'tain\\'t no harm to\\nhope.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they think so now, at any rate,\" Christopher replied, as he\\nturned away to unharness the patient horses.\\n\\nAt breakfast, an hour or two later, he learned that his mother\\nwas in one of her high humours, and that, awaking early and\\nprattling merrily of the past, she insisted that they should\\ndress her immediately in her black brocade. When the meal was\\nover he carried her from her bed to the old oak chair, in which\\nshe managed to keep upright among her pillows. Her gallant spirit\\nwas still youthful and undaunted, and the many infirmities of her\\nbody were powerless to distort the cheerful memories behind her\\nsightless eyes.\\n\\nLeaving her presently, after a careless chat about the foibles of\\nBolivar Blake, he took his hoe from an outhouse and went to\\n\"grub\" the young weeds from the tobacco, which had now reached\\nits luxuriant August height. By noon his day\\'s work on the crop\\nwas over, and he was resting for a moment in the shadow of a\\nlocust tree by the fence, when he heard rapid footsteps\\napproaching in the new road, and Bill Fletcher threw himself over\\nthe crumbling rails and came panting into the strip of shade. At\\nsight of the man\\'s face Christopher flung his hoe out into the\\nfield, where it bore down a giant plant, and bracing his body\\nagainst the tree, prepared himself to withstand the shock of the\\nfirst blow; but the other, after glaring at him for a breathless\\ninstant, fell back and rapped out a single thundering oath. \"You\\nhell-hound! This is all your doing!\"\\n\\nThrowing off the words with a gesture of his arm, Christopher\\nstared coolly into the other\\'s distorted face; then, yielding to\\nthe moment\\'s vindictive impulse, he broke into a sneering laugh.\\n\\n\"So you have heard the good news?\" he inquired lightly.\\n\\nBefore the rage in the old man\\'s eyes--before the convulsed\\nfeatures and the quivering limbs--he felt a savage joy suddenly\\ntake possession of him.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all your doing, every last bit of it,\" repeated Fletcher\\nhoarsely, \"and I\\'ll live to pay you back if I hang for it in the\\nend!\"\\n\\n\"Go ahead, then,\" retorted Christopher; \"you might as well hang\\nfor a sheep as for a lamb, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you think I\\'m fooling?\" said the other, wiping a fleck of\\nfoam from his mouth, \"but you\\'ll find out better some day, unless\\nthe devil gets you mighty quick. You\\'ve made that boy a scamp and\\na drunkard, and now you\\'ve gone and married him to a--\" He\\nswallowed the words and stood gasping above his loosened collar.\\n\\nChristopher paled slightly beneath his sunburn; then, as he\\nrecovered his assurance, a brutal smile was sketched about his\\nmouth.\\n\\n\"Come, come, go easy,\" he protested flippantly; \"there\\'s such a\\nthing, you remember, as the pot calling the kettle black.\"\\n\\nHis gay voice fell strangely on the other\\'s husky tones, and for\\nthe moment, in spite of his earth-stained hands and his clothes\\nof coarse blue jean, he might have been a man of the world\\ncondescending to a peasant. It was at such times, when a raw\\nemotion found expression in the primitive lives about him, that\\nhe realised most vividly the gulf between him and his neighbours.\\nTo his superficial unconcern they presented the sincerity of\\nnaked passion.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve made the boy what he is,\" repeated the old man, in a\\nquiver from head to foot. \"You\\'ve done your level best to send\\nhim to the devil.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he had a pretty good start, it seems, before I ever laid\\neyes on him.\"\\n\\n\"You set out to ruin him from the first, and I watched you,\" went\\non Fletcher, choking over each separate word before he uttered\\nit; \"my eye was on your game, and if you were anything but the\\nbiggest villain on earth I could have stopped it. But for you\\nhe\\'d be a decent chap this very minute.\"\\n\\n\"And the pattern of his grandfather,\" sneered Christopher.\\n\\nFletcher raised his arm for a blow and then let it fall limply to\\nhis side. \"Oh, I\\'m done with you now, and I\\'m done with your\\ngang,\" he said. \"Play your devil\\'s tricks as much as you please;\\nthey won\\'t touch me. If that boy sets foot on my land again I\\'ll\\nhorsewhip him as I would a hound. Let him see who\\'ll feed him now\\nwhen he comes to starve.\"\\n\\nCatching his breath, Christopher stared at him an instant in\\nsilence; then he spoke in a voice which had grown serious.\\n\\n\"The more fool you, then,\" he said. \"The chap\\'s your grandson,\\nand he\\'s a better one than you deserve. Whatever he is, I tell\\nyou now, he\\'s a long sight too good for such as you--and so is\\nMolly Peterkin, for that matter. Heavens above! What are you that\\nyou should become a stickler for honesty in others? Do you think\\nI\\'ve forgotten that you drove my father to his grave, and that\\nthe very land you live on you stole from me? Pshaw! It takes more\\nthan twenty years to bury a thing like that, you fool!\"\\n\\nFletcher looked helplessly round for a weapon, and catching sight\\nof the hoe, raised it in his hands; but Christopher, seizing it\\nroughly from him, tossed it behind him in the little path.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have none of that,\" added the young man grimly.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a liar, as your father was before you,\" burst out\\nFletcher, swallowing hard; \"and as for that scamp you\\'ve gone and\\nsent to hell, you can let him starve or not, jest as you please.\\nHe has made his choice between us, and he can stick to it till he\\nrots in the poorhouse. Much good you\\'ll do him in the end, I\\nreckon.\"\\n\\n\"Well, just now it seems he hasn\\'t chosen either of us,\" remarked\\nChristopher, cooling rapidly as the other\\'s anger grew red hot.\\n\"It rather looks as if he\\'d chosen Molly Peterkin.\"\\n\\n\"Damn you!\" gasped Fletcher, putting up a nerveless hand to tear\\nhis collar apart, while a purple flush rose slowly from his\\nthroat to his forehead. \"If you name that huzzy to me again I\\'ll\\nthrash you within an inch of your life!\"\\n\\n\"Let\\'s try it,\" suggested Christopher in an irritating drawl.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m used to bullies like you,\" pursued the old man. \"I know\\nthe kind of brute that thinks he can knock his way into heaven.\\nYour father was jest sech another, and if you come to die a crazy\\ndrunkard like him it\\'ll be about the end that you deserve!\"\\n\\nAn impatient frown drew Christopher\\'s brows together, and,\\npicking up the hoe, he walked leisurely out into the field.\\n\\n\"Well, I can\\'t stop to hear your opinion of me,\" he observed.\\n\"You\\'ll have to keep it until another time,\" and breaking into a\\ncareless whistle, he strode off between the tobacco furrows on\\nhis way to bring the old mare from the pasture.\\n\\nA little later, alone with the broad white noon and the stillness\\nof the meadow, his gay whistle ended abruptly on his lips and the\\nold sullen frown contracted his heavy brows. It was in vain that\\nhe tried to laugh away the depression of the moment; the white\\nglare of the fields and the perfume of wild flowers blooming in\\nhot sunshine produced in him a sensation closely akin to physical\\nnausea--a disgust of himself and of the life and the humanity\\nthat he had known. What was it all worth, after all? And what of\\nsatisfaction was there to be found in the thing he sought?\\nFletcher\\'s face rose suddenly before him, and when he tried to\\nbanish the memory the effort that he made brought but the more\\ndistinctly to his eyes the coarse, bloated features with the\\nswollen veins across the nose. Trivial recollections returned to\\nannoy him--the way the man sucked in his breath when he was\\nangry, and the ceaseless twitching of the small muscles above his\\nbloodshot eyes. \"Pshaw! What business is it of mine?\" he\\nquestioned angrily. \"What am I to the man, that I cannot escape\\nthe disgust that he arouses? Is it possible that I should be\\nhaunted forever by a face I hate? There are times when I could\\nkill him simply because of the repulsion that I feel. As for the\\nboy--let him marry a dozen Molly Peterkins--who cares? Not I,\\nsurely. When he turns upon his grandfather and they fall to\\ngnawing at each other\\'s bones, the better I shall be pleased.\" He\\nshook his head impatiently, but the oppression which in some\\nvague way he associated with the white heat and the scent of wild\\nflowers still weighed heavily upon his thoughts. \"Is it possible\\nthat after all that has happened I am not yet satisfied?\" he\\nasked, with annoyance.\\n\\nFor awhile he lingered by the little brook in the pasture, and\\nthen slipping the bridle on the old mare, returned slowly to the\\nhouse. At the bars he met Sol Peterkin, who had hurried over in\\nevident consternation to deliver his news.\\n\\n\"Good Lord, Mr. Christopher! What do you think that gal of mine\\nhas gone and done now?\"\\n\\nChristopher slid the topmost bar from its place and lifted his\\nhead\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tell me that she\\'s divorced already,\" he returned. \"Why,\\nthe last I heard of her she had run off this morning to marry\\nWill Fletcher.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, suh; that\\'s it,\" said Sol. \"I\\'m meanin\\' the marriage.\\nWell, well, it does seem that you can\\'t settle down an\\' begin to\\nsay yo\\' grace over one trouble befo\\' a whole batch lights upon\\nyou. To think, arter the way I\\'ve sweated an\\' delved to be\\nhonest, that a gal of mine should tie me hand an\\' foot to Bill\\nFletcher.\"\\n\\nIn spite of his moodiness, the humour of the situation struck\\nhome to Christopher, and throwing back his head he burst into a\\nlaugh.\\n\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t poke yo\\' fun, suh,\" continued Sol. \"Money is a\\nmighty good thing, but you can\\'t put it in the blood, like you\\nkin meanness. All Bill Fletcher\\'s riches ain\\'t soaked in him\\nblood an\\' bone, but his meanness is, an\\' that thar meanness goes\\na long sight further than his money. Thar ain\\'t much sto\\' set by\\nhonesty in this here world, suh, an\\' you kin buy a bigger chaw of\\ntobaccy with five cents than you kin with all the virtue of Moses\\non his Mount; but all the same it\\'s a mighty good thing to rest\\nyo\\' head on when you go to bed, an\\' I ain\\'t sure but it makes\\neasier lyin\\' than a linen pillow-slip an\\' a white goose tick--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I dare say,\" interrupted Christopher; \"but now that it\\'s\\nover we must make the best of it. She didn\\'t marry Bill Fletcher,\\nafter all, you know--\"\\n\\nHe checked himself with a start, and the bridle slipped from his\\narm to the ground, for his name was called suddenly in a high\\nvoice from the house, and as he swung himself over the bars Lila\\ncame running barehead across the yard.\\n\\n\"Christopher!\" she cried; \"we could not find you, and Bill\\nFletcher has talked to mother like a madman. Come quickly! She\\nhas fainted!\"\\n\\nBefore she had finished, he had dashed past her and through the\\nhouse into the little parlour, where the old lady sat erect and\\nunconscious in her Elizabethan chair.\\n\\n\"I found her like this,\" said Lila, weeping. \"We heard loud\\nvoices and then a scream, and when we rushed in the man left, and\\nshe sat looking straight ahead like this--like this.\"\\n\\nThrowing himself upon his knees beside the chair, Christopher\\ncaught his mother to his breast and turned angrily upon the\\nwomen.\\n\\n\"Has nothing been done? Where is the doctor?\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Jim has gone for him. Here, let me take her,\" said Cynthia,\\nunclasping his arms. \"There, stand back. She is not dead. In a\\nlittle while she will come to herself again.\"\\n\\nRising from the floor, he stood motionless in the center of the\\nroom, where the atmosphere was heavy with the fragrance of\\ncamphor and tea-roses. A broad strip of sunshine was at his feet,\\nand in the twisted aspen beside the window a catbird was singing.\\nThese remained with him for years afterward, and with them the\\nmemory of the blind woman sitting stiffy erect and staring\\nvacantly into his face.\\n\\n\"He has told her everything,\" said Cynthia--\"after twenty years.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK IV. The Awakening\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I. The Unforeseen\\n\\nThe road was steep, and Christopher, descending from the big,\\nlumbering cart, left the oxen to crawl slowly up the incline. It\\nwas a windy afternoon in March, and he was returning from a trip\\nto Farrar\\'s mill, which was reached by a lane that branched off a\\nhalf-mile or so from the cross-roads. A blue sky shone brightly\\nthrough the leafless boughs above him, and along the little\\nwayside path tufts of dandelion were blooming in the red dust.\\nThe wind, which blew straight toward him from the opening beyond\\nthe strip of wood in which he walked, brought the fresh scent of\\nthe upturned fields and of the swelling buds putting out with the\\nwarm sunshine. In his own veins he felt also that the blood had\\nstirred, and that strange, quickening impulse, which comes with\\nthe rising sap alike to a man and to a tree, worked restlessly in\\nhis limbs at the touch of spring. Nature was alive again, and he\\nfelt vaguely that in the resurrection surrounding him he must\\nhave his part--that in him as well as in the earth the spirit of\\nlife must move and put forth in gladness. A flock of swallows\\npassed suddenly like a streak of smoke on the blue sky overhead,\\nand as his eyes followed them the old roving instinct pulled at\\nhis heart. To be up and away, to drink life to its dregs and come\\nhome for rest, were among the impulses which awoke with the\\nreturn of spring.\\n\\nThe oxen moved behind him at a leisurely pace, and outstripping\\nthem in a little while, he had turned at a sudden opening in the\\ntrees into the main road, when, to his surprise, he saw a woman\\nin black, followed by a small yellow dog, walking in front of him\\nalong the grassy path. As he caught sight of her a strong gust of\\nwind swept down the road, wrapping her skirt closely about her\\nand whirling a last year\\'s leaf into her face. For a moment she\\npaused and, throwing back her head, drank the air like water;\\nthen, holding firmly to her hat, she started on again at her\\nrapid pace. In the ease with which she moved against the wind, in\\nthe self-possession of her carriage, and most of all in the grace\\nwith which she lifted her long black skirt, made, he could see,\\nafter the fashion of the outside world, he realised at once that\\nshe was a stranger to the neighbourhood. No woman whom he had\\nknown--not even Lila--had this same light yet energetic walk--a\\nwalk in which every line in her body moved in accord with the\\nbuoyant impulse that controlled her step. As he watched her he\\nrecalled instantly the flight of a swallow in the air, for her\\npassage over the ground was as direct and beautiful as a bird\\'s.\\n\\nWhen he neared her she turned suddenly, and, as she flung back\\nher short veil, he saw to his amazement that he faced Maria\\nFletcher.\\n\\n\"So you have forgotten me?\" she said, with a smile. \"Or have I\\nchanged so greatly that my old friends do not know me?\"\\n\\nShe held out her hand, and while a tremor ran through him, he\\nkept her bared palm for an instant in his own.\\n\\n\"You dropped from the sky,\" he answered, steadying his voice with\\nan effort. \"You have taken my breath away and I cannot speak.\"\\n\\nThen letting her hand fall, he stood looking at her in a wonder\\nthat shone in his face, for to the Maria whom he had known the\\nwoman before him now bore only the resemblance that the finished\\nportrait bears to the charcoal sketch; and the years which had so\\nchanged and softened her had given her girlish figure a nobility\\nthat belonged to the maturity she had not reached. It was not\\nthat she had grown beautiful--when he sought for physical changes\\nhe found only that her cheek was rounder, her bosom fuller; but\\nif she still lacked the ruddy attraction of mere flesh-and-blood\\nloveliness, she had gained the deeper fascination which is the\\noutward accompaniment of a fervent spirit. Her eyes, her voice,\\nher gestures were all attuned to the inner harmony which he\\nrecognised also in the smile with which she met his words; and\\nthe charm that she irradiated was that rarest of all physical\\ngifts, the power of the flesh to express the soul that it\\nenvelops.\\n\\nThe wind or the meeting with himself had brought a faint flush to\\nher cheek, but without lowering her eyes she stood regarding him\\nwith her warm, grave smile. The pale oval of her face, framed in\\nthe loosened waves of her black hair, had for him all the\\nremoteness that surrounded her memory; and yet, though he knew it\\nnot, the appeal she made to him now, and had made long ago, was\\nthat he recognised in her, however dumbly, a creature born, like\\nhimself, with the power to experience the fulness of joy or\\ngrief.\\n\\n\"So I have taken your breath away,\" she said; \"and you have\\nforgotten Agag.\"\\n\\n\"Agag?\" he turned with a question and followed her glance in the\\ndirection of the dog. \"It is the brute you saved?\"\\n\\n\"Only he is not a brute--I have seen many men who were more of\\none. Look! He recognises you. He has followed me everywhere, but\\nhe doesn\\'t like Europe, and if you could have seen his joy when\\nwe got out at the cross-roads and he smelt the familiar country!\\nIt was almost as great as mine.\"\\n\\n\"As yours? Then you no longer hate it?\"\\n\\n\"I have learned to love it in the last six years,\" she answered,\\n\"as I have learned to love many things that I once hated. Oh,\\nthis wind is good when it blows over the ploughed fields, and yet\\nbetween city streets it would bring only dust and discomfort.\"\\n\\nShe threw back her head, looking up into the sky, where a bird\\npassed.\\n\\n\"Will you get into the cart now?\" he asked after a moment,\\nvaguely troubled by the silence and by the gentleness of her\\nupward look, \"or do you wish to walk to the top of the hill?\"\\n\\nShe turned and moved quickly on again.\\n\\n\"It is such a little way, let us walk,\" she replied, and then\\nwith a laugh she offered an explanation of her presence. \"I wrote\\ntwice, but I had no answer,\" she said; \"then I decided to come,\\nand telegraphed, but they handed me my telegram and my last\\nletter at the cross-roads. Can something have happened, do you\\nthink? or is it merely carelessness that keeps them from sending\\nfor the mail?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know; but they are all alive, at least. You have come\\nstraight from--where?\"\\n\\n\"From abroad. I lived there for six years, first in one place,\\nthen in another--chiefly in Italy. My husband died eighteen\\nmonths ago, but I stayed on with his people. It seemed then that\\nthey needed me most, but one can never tell, and I may have made\\na mistake in not coming home sooner.\"\\n\\n\"I think you did,\" he said quietly, running the end of his long\\nwhip through his fingers.\\n\\nShe flashed a disturbed glance at him.\\n\\n\"Is it possible that you are keeping something from me? Is any\\none ill?\"\\n\\n\"Not that I have heard of, but I never see any of them, you know,\\nexcept your brother.\"\\n\\n\"And he is married. They told me so at the cross-roads. I can\\'t\\nunderstand why they did not let me know.\"\\n\\n\"It was very sudden--they went to Washington.\"\\n\\n\"How queer! Who is the girl, I wonder?\"\\n\\n\"Her name was Molly Peterkin--old Sol\\'s daughter; you may\\nremember him.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"No; I\\'ve lived here so little, you see. What\\nis she like?\"\\n\\n\"A beauty, with blue eyes and yellow hair.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? And are they happy?\" He laughed. \"They are in love--or\\nwere, six months ago.\"\\n\\n\"You are cynical. But do they live at the Hall?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet. Your grandfather has not spoken to Will since the\\nmarriage, and that was last August.\"\\n\\n\"Where, under heaven, do they live, then?\"\\n\\n\"On a little farm he has given them adjoining Sol\\'s. I believe he\\nmeans that they shall raise tobacco for a living.\"\\n\\nShe made a gesture of distress. \"Oh, I ought to have come home\\nlong ago!\"\\n\\n\"What difference would that have made: you could have done\\nnothing. A thunderbolt falling at his feet doesn\\'t sober a man\\nwhen he is in love.\"\\n\\n\"I might have helped--one never knows. At least I should have\\nbeen at my post, for, after all, the ties of blood are the\\nstrongest claims we have.\"\\n\\n\"Why should they be?\" he questioned, with sudden bitterness. \"You\\nare more like that swallow flying up there than you are like any\\nFletcher that ever lived.\"\\n\\nShe smiled. \"I thought so once,\" she answered, \"but now I know\\nbetter. The likeness must be there, and I am going to find it.\"\\n\\n\"You will never find it,\" he insisted, \"for there is nothing of\\nthem in you--nothing.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t like them, I remember.\"\\n\\n\"Nor do you.\"\\n\\nA laugh broke from her and humour rippled in her eyes.\\n\\n\"So you still persist in the truth, and in the plain truth!\" she\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n\"Then it is so, you confess it?\"\\n\\n\"No, no, no,\" she protested. \"Why, I love them all--all, do you\\nhear, and I love Will more than the rest of them put together.\"\\n\\nHe looked away from her, and then, turning, waited for the oxen\\nto reach the summit of the hill.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better get in now, I think,\" he said; \"there is a long\\nwalk ahead of us, and if my team is slow it is sure also.\"\\n\\nAs he brought the oxen to a halt, she laid her hand for an\\ninstant on his arm, and, mounting lightly upon the wheel, stepped\\ninto the cart.\\n\\n\"Now give me Agag,\" she said, and he handed her the little dog\\nbefore he took up the ropes and settled himself beside her on the\\ndriver\\'s seat. \"You look like one of the disinherited princesses\\nin the old stories mother tells,\" he observed.\\n\\nA puzzled wonder was in her face as she turned toward him.\\n\\n\"Who are you? And what has Blake Hall to do with your family?\"\\nshe asked.\\n\\n\"Only that it was named after us. We used to live there.\"\\n\\n\"Within your recollection?\"\\n\\nHe nodded, with his eyes on the slow oxen.\\n\\n\"Then you have not always been a farmer?\"\\n\\n\"Ever since I was ten years old.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand, I can\\'t understand,\" she said, perplexed.\\n\"You are like no one about here; you are like no one I have ever\\nseen.\"\\n\\n\"Then I must be like you,\" he returned bluntly.\\n\\n\"Like me? Oh, heavens, no; you would make three of me--body,\\nbrain, and soul. I believe, when I think of it, that you are the\\nbiggest man I\\'ve ever known--and by that I don\\'t mean in height--\\nfor I have seen men with a greater number of physical inches.\\nInches, somehow, have very little to do with the impression--and\\nso has muscle, strong as yours is. It is simple bigness that I am\\ntalking about, and it was the first thing I noticed in you--\"\\n\\n\"At the cross-roads?\" he asked, and instantly regretted his\\nwords.\\n\\n\"No; not at the cross-roads,\" she answered, smiling. \"You have a\\ngood memory; but mine is better. I saw you once on a June\\nmorning, when I was riding along the road with the chestnuts and\\nyou were standing out in the field.\"\\n\\n\"I did not see you or I should have remembered,\" he said quietly.\\n\\nSilence fell between them, and he was conscious in every fiber of\\nhis body--that he had never been so close to her before--had\\nnever felt the touch of her arm upon his own, nor the folds of\\nher skirt brushing against his knees. A gust of wind whipped the\\nend of her veil into his face, and when she turned to recapture\\nit he felt her warm breath on his cheek. The sense of her\\nnearness pervaded him from head to foot, and an unrest like that\\nproduced by the spring wind troubled his heart. He did not look\\nat her, and yet he saw her full dark eyes and the curve of her\\nwhite throat more distinctly than he beheld the blue sky at which\\nhe gazed. Was it possible that she, too, shared his disquietude?\\nhe wondered, or was the silence that she kept as undisturbed as\\nher tranquil pose?\\n\\n\"I should not have forgotten it,\" he repeated presently, turning\\nto meet her glance.\\n\\nShe started and looked away from the landscape. \"You have long\\nmemories in this county, I know,\" she said. \"So few things happen\\nthat it becomes a religion to cherish the little incidents. It\\nmay be that I, too, have inherited something of this, for I\\nremember very clearly the few months I spent here.\"\\n\\n\"You remembered them even while you were away?\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\" she asked. \"It is not the moving about, the strange\\nplaces one sees, nor the people one meets, that really count in\\nlife, you know.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" he questioned abruptly.\\n\\nShe hesitated as if trying to put her thoughts more clearly into\\nwords.\\n\\n\"I think it is the things one learns,\" she said; \"the places in\\nwhich we take root and grow, and the people who teach us what is\\nreally worth while--patience, and charity, and the beauty there\\nis in the simplest and most common lives when they are lived\\nclose to Nature.\"\\n\\n\"In driving the plough or in picking the suckers from a tobacco\\nplant,\" he added scornfully.\\n\\n\"In those things, yes; and in any life that is good, and true,\\nand natural.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I have lived near enough to Nature to hate her with all my\\nmight,\" he answered, not without bitterness. \"Why, there are\\ntimes when I\\'d like to kick every ploughed field I see out into\\neternity. Tobacco-growing is one of the natural things, I\\nsuppose, but if you want to see any beauty in it you must watch\\nit from a shady road. When you get in the midst of it you\\'ll find\\nit coarse and sticky, and given over generally to worms. I have\\nspent my whole life working on it, and to this day I never look\\nat a plant nor smell a pipe without a shiver of disgust. The\\nthings I want are over there,\" he finished, pointing with his\\nwhip-handle to the clear horizon. \"I want the excitement that\\nmakes one\\'s blood run like wine.\"\\n\\n\"Battle, murder, and all that, I suppose?\" she said, smiling.\\n\\n\"War, and fame, and love,\" he corrected.\\n\\nHer face had grown grave, and in the thoughtful look she turned\\nupon him it seemed to him that he saw a purpose slowly take form.\\nSo earnest was her gaze that at last his own fell before it, at\\nwhich she murmured a confused apology, like one forcibly awakened\\nfrom a dream.\\n\\n\"I was wondering what that other life would have made of you,\"\\nshe said; \"the life that I have known and wearied of--a life of\\npetty shams, of sham love, of sham hate, of sham religion. It is\\nall little, you know, and it takes a little soul to keep alive in\\nit. I craved it once myself, and it took six years of artifice to\\nteach me that I loved a plain truth better than a pretty lie.\"\\n\\nHe had been looking at the strong white hand lying in her lap,\\nand now, with a laugh, he held out his own bronzed and roughened\\none.\\n\\n\"There is the difference,\" he said; \"do you see it?\"\\n\\nA wave of sympathy swept over her expressive face, and with one\\nof her impulsive gestures, which seemed always to convey some\\nspiritual significance, she touched his outstretched palm with\\nher fingers. \"How full of meaning it is,\" she replied, \"for it\\ntells of quiet days in the fields, and of a courage that has not\\nfaltered before the thing it hates. When I look at it it makes me\\nfeel very humble--and yet very proud, too, that some day I may be\\nyour friend.\"\\n\\nHe shook his head, with his eyes on the sun, which was slowly\\nsetting.\\n\\n\"That is out of the question,\" he answered. \"You cannot be my\\nfriend except for this single day. If I meet you to-morrow I\\nshall not know you.\"\\n\\n\"Because I am a Fletcher?\" she asked, wondering.\\n\\n\"Because you are a Fletcher, and because you would find me worse\\nthan a Fletcher.\"\\n\\n\"Riddles, riddles,\" she protested, laughing; \"and I was always\\ndull at guessing--but I may as well warn you now that I have come\\nhome determined to make a friend of every mortal in the county,\\nman and beast.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll do it,\" he answered seriously. \"I\\'m the only thing about\\nhere that will resist you. You\\'ll be everybody\\'s friend but\\nmine.\"\\n\\nShe caught and held his gaze. \"Let us see,\" she responded\\nquietly.\\n\\nFor a time they were silent, and spreading out her skirt, she\\nmade a place for the dog upon it. The noise of the heavy wheels\\non the rocky bed of the road grew suddenly louder in his ears,\\nand he realised with a pang that every jolt of the cart carried\\nhim nearer the end. With the thought there came to him a wish\\nthat life might pause at the instant--that the earth might be\\narrested in its passage and leave him forever aware of the warm\\ncontact that thrilled through him. They had already passed\\nWeatherby\\'s lane, and presently the chimneys of Blake Hall\\nappeared above the distant trees. When they reached the abandoned\\nice-pond Christopher spoke with an attempted carelessness.\\n\\n\"It would perhaps be better for you to walk the rest of the way,\"\\nhe said. \"Trouble might be made in the beginning if your\\ngrandfather were to know that I brought you over.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right, I think,\" she said, and rising as the cart\\nstopped, she followed him down into the road. Then with a word or\\ntwo of thanks, she smiled brightly, and, calling the dog, passed\\nrapidly into the twilight which stretched between him and a\\nsingle shining window that was visible in the Hall.\\n\\nAfter she had quite disappeared he still stood motionless by the\\nice-pond, staring into the dusk that had swallowed her up from\\nhis gaze. So long did he remain there that at last the oxen tired\\nof waiting and began to move slowly on along the sunken road.\\nThen starting abruptly from his meditation, he picked up the\\nropes that trailed before him on the ground and fell into his\\naccustomed walk beside the cart. At the moment it seemed to him\\nthat his whole life was shattered into pieces by the event of a\\nsingle instant. Something stronger than himself had shaken the\\nfoundations of his nature, and he was not the man that he had\\nbeen before. He was like one born blind, who, when his eyes are\\nopened, is ignorant that the light which dazzles him is merely\\nthe shining of the sun.\\n\\nWhen he came into the house, after putting up the oxen, Cynthia\\ncommented upon the dazed look that he wore.\\n\\n\"You must have fallen asleep on the way home,\" she remarked.\\n\\n\"It is the glare of the lamp,\" he answered. \"I have just come out\\nof the darkness,\" and before sitting down to his supper, he\\nopened the door and listened for the sound of his mother\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"She is asleep, then?\" he said, coming back again. \"Has she\\nrecognised either of you to-day?\"\\n\\n\"No; she wanders again. The present is nothing to her any\\nlonger--it is all blotted out with everything that Fletcher told\\nher. She asks for father constantly, and the only thing that\\ninterested her was when Jim went in and talked to her about\\nfarming. She is quite rational except that she has entirely\\nforgotten the last twenty years, and just before falling asleep\\nshe laughed heartily over some old stories of Grandpa Bolivar\\'s.\"\\n\\n\"Then I may see her for a minute?\"\\n\\n\"If you wish it--yes.\"\\n\\nPassing along the hall, he entered the little chamber where the\\nold lady lay asleep in her tester bed. Her fine white hair was\\nbrushed over the pillow, and her drawn and yellowed face wore a\\nplacid and childlike look. As he paused beside her a faint smile\\nflickered about her mouth and her delicate hand trembled slightly\\nupon the counterpane. Her dreams had evidently brought her\\nhappiness, and as he stood looking down upon her the wish entered\\nhis heart that he might change his young life for her old one--\\nthat he might become, in her place, half dead, and done with all\\nthat the future could bring of either joy or grief.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. Maria Returns to the Hall\\n\\nThrough the grove of oaks a single lighted window glimmered now\\nred, now yellow, as lamplight struggled with firelight inside,\\nand Maria, walking rapidly through the dark, felt that the\\ncomfortable warmth shining on the panes was her first welcome\\nhome. The night had grown chilly, and she gathered her wraps\\nclosely together as she hastened along the gravelled drive and\\nran up the broad stone steps to the closed door. There was no\\nanswer to her knock, and, finding that the big silver handle of\\nthe door turned easily, she entered the hall and passed\\ncautiously through the dusk that enveloped the great staircase.\\nHer foot was on the first step, when a stream of light issued\\nsuddenly from the dining-room, and, turning, she stood for an\\ninstant hesitating upon the threshold. A lamp burned dimly in the\\ncenter of the old mahogany table, where a scant supper for two\\nhad been hastily laid. In the fireplace a single hickory log sent\\nout a shower of fine sparks, which hovered a moment in the air\\nbefore they were sucked up by the big stone chimney. The room was\\njust as Maria had left it six years before, and yet in some\\nunaccountable fashion it seemed to have lost the dignity which\\nshe remembered as its one redeeming feature. Nothing was changed\\nthat she could see--the furniture stood in the same places, the\\nsame hard engravings hung on the discoloured walls--but as she\\nglanced wonderingly about her she was aware of a shock greater\\nthan the one she had nerved herself to withstand. It was, after\\nall, the atmosphere that depressed her, she concluded with her\\nnext thought--the general air of slovenly unrefinement revealed\\nin the details of the room and of the carelessly laid table.\\n\\nWhile she still hesitated uncertainly on the threshold, the\\npantry door opened noiselessly and Miss Saidie appeared, carrying\\na glass dish filled with preserved watermelon rind. At sight of\\nMaria she gave a start and a little scream, and the dish fell\\nfrom her hands and crashed upon the floor.\\n\\n\"Sakes alive! Is that you, Maria?\"\\n\\nHastily crossing the room, Maria caught the little woman in her\\narms and kissed her twice.\\n\\n\"Why, you poor thing! I\\'ve frightened you to death,\" she said,\\nwith a laugh.\\n\\n\"You did give me a turn; that\\'s so,\" replied Miss Saidie, as she\\nwiped the moisture from her crimson face. \"It\\'s been so long\\nsince anybody\\'s come here that Malindy--she\\'s the only servant\\nwe\\'ve got now--was actually afraid to answer your knock. Then\\nwhen I came in and saw you standing by the door, I declare it\\nalmost took my breath clean away. I thought for a moment you were\\na ghost, you looked so dead white in that long, black dress.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m flesh and blood, never fear,\" Maria assured her. \"Much\\nmore flesh and blood, too, than I was when I went away--but I\\'ve\\nmade you spill all your preserves. What a shame!\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie glanced down a little nervously. \"I must wipe it up\\nbefore Brother Bill comes in,\" she said; \"it frets him so to see\\na waste.\"\\n\\nPicking up a dust-cloth she had left on a chair, she got down on\\nher knees and began mopping up the sticky syrup which trickled\\nalong the floor. \"He hates so to throw away anything,\" she\\npursued, panting softly from her exertions, \"that if he were to\\nsee this I believe it would upset him for a week. Oh, he didn\\'t\\nuse to be like that, I know,\" she added, meeting Maria\\'s amazed\\nlook; \"and it does seem strange, for I\\'m sure he gets richer and\\nricher every day--but it\\'s the gospel truth that every cent he\\nmakes he hugs closer than he did the last. I declare, I\\'ve seen\\nhim haggle for an hour over the price of salt, and it turns him\\npositively sick to see anything but specked potatoes on the\\ntable. He kinder thinks his money is all he\\'s got, I reckon, so\\nhe holds on to it like grim death.\"\\n\\n\"But it isn\\'t all he has. Where\\'s Will?\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie shook her head, with a glance in the direction of the\\ndoor.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mention him if you want any peace,\" she said, rising with\\ndifficulty to her feet. \"Your grandpa has never so much as laid\\neyes on him sence he gave him that little worn-out place side by\\nside with Sol Peterkin--and told him he\\'d shoot him if he ever\\ncaught sight of him at the Hall. You\\'ve come home to awful worry,\\nthar\\'s no doubt of it, Maria.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, oh, oh,\" sighed Maria, and, tossing her hat upon the sofa,\\npressed her fingers on her temples. With the firelight thrown\\nfull on the ivory pallor of her face, the effect she produced was\\nalmost unreal in its intensity of black and white--an absence of\\ncolour which had in it all the warmth and the animation we are\\nused to associate with brilliant hues. A peculiar mellowness of\\ntemperament, the expression of a passionate nature confirmed in\\nsympathy, shone in the softened fervour of her look as she bent\\nher eyes thoughtfully upon the flames.\\n\\n\"Something must be done for Will,\" she said, turning presently.\\n\"This can\\'t go on another day.\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie caught her breath sharply, and hastened to the head\\nof the table, as Fletcher\\'s heavy footsteps crossed the hall.\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, be careful,\" she whispered warningly, jerking\\nher head nervously from side to side.\\n\\nFletcher entered with a black look, slamming the door heavily\\nbehind him, then, suddenly catching sight of Maria, he stopped\\nshort on the threshold and stared at her with hanging jaws.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be blessed if it ain\\'t Maria!\" he broke out at last.\\n\\nMaria went toward him and held out her cheek for his kiss.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve surprised you almost as much as I did Aunt Saidie,\" she\\nsaid, with her cheerful laugh, which floated a little strangely\\non the sullen atmosphere.\\n\\nCatching her by the shoulder, Fletcher drew her into the circle\\nof the lamplight, where he stood regarding her in gloomy silence.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve filled out considerable,\" he remarked, as he released her\\nat the end of his long scrutiny. \"But thar was room for it,\\nheaven knows. You\\'ll never be the sort that a man smacks his lips\\nover, I reckon, but you\\'re a plum sight better looking than you\\nwere when you went away.\"\\n\\nMaria winced quickly as if he had struck her; then, regaining her\\ncomposure almost instantly, she drew back her chair with a casual\\nretort.\\n\\n\"But I didn\\'t come home to set the county afire,\" she said. \"Why,\\nAunt Saidie, what queer, coarse china! What\\'s become of the\\nwhite-and-gold set I used to like?\"\\n\\nA purple flush mounted, slowly to Miss Saidie\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"I was afraid it would chip, so I packed it away,\" she explained.\\n\"Me and Brother Bill ain\\'t used to any better than this, so we\\ndon\\'t notice. Things will have to be mighty fine now, I reckon,\\nsince you\\'ve got back. You were always particular about looks, I\\nremember.\"\\n\\n\"Was I?\" asked Maria curiously, glancing down into the plate\\nbefore her. For the last few years she had schooled herself to\\ndespise what she called the \"silly luxuries of living,\" and yet\\nthe heavy white cup which Miss Saidie handed her, and the sound\\nof Fletcher drinking his coffee, aroused in her the old poignant\\ndisgust.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I\\'m over particular now,\" she added pleasantly,\\n\"but we may as well get out the other china tomorrow, I think.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t find many fancy ways here--eh, Saidie?\" inquired\\nFletcher, with a chuckle. \"Thar\\'s been a precious waste of\\nvictuals on this place, but it\\'s got to stop. I ain\\'t so sure you\\ndid a wise thing in coming back,\" he finished abruptly, turning\\nhis bloodshot eyes on his granddaughter.\\n\\n\"You aren\\'t? Well, I am,\" laughed Maria; \"and I promise you that\\nyou shan\\'t find me troublesome except in the matter of china.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must have changed your skin, I reckon.\"\\n\\n\"Changed? Why, I have, of course. Six years isn\\'t a day, you\\nknow, and I\\'ve been in many places.\" Then, as a hint of interest\\nawoke in his eyes, she talked on rapidly, describing her years\\nabroad and the strange cities in which she had lived. Before she\\nhad finished, Fletcher had pushed his plate away and sat\\nlistening with the ghost of a smile upon his face.\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ll do, I reckon,\" he said at the end, and, pushing\\nback his chair, he rose from his place and stamped out into the\\nhall.\\n\\nWhen he had gone into his sitting-room and closed the door behind\\nhim, Miss Saidie nodded smilingly, as she measured out the\\nservant\\'s sugar in a cracked saucer. \"He\\'s brighter than I\\'ve\\nseen him for days,\" she said; \"and now, if you want to go\\nupstairs, Malindy has jest lighted your fire. She had to carry\\nthe wood up while we were at supper, so Brother Bill wouldn\\'t see\\nit. He hates even to burn a log, though they are strewn round\\nloose all over the place.\"\\n\\nMaria, was feeding Agag on the hearth, and she waited until he\\nhad finished before she took up her hat and wraps and went toward\\nthe door. \"Oh, you needn\\'t bother to light me,\" she said, waving\\nMiss Saidie back when she would have followed. \"Why, I could find\\nmy way over this house at midnight without a candle.\" Then, with\\na cheerful \"Goodnight,\" she called Agag and went up the dusky\\nstaircase.\\n\\nA wood fire was burning in her room, and she stood for a moment\\nlooking pensively into the flames, a faint smile sketched about\\nher mouth. Then throwing off her black dress in the desire for\\nfreedom, she clasped her hands above her head and paced slowly up\\nand down the shadowy length of the room. In the flowing measure\\nof her walk; in the free, almost defiant, movement of her\\nupraised arms; and in the ample lines of her throat and bosom,\\nwhich melted gradually into the low curves of her hips, she might\\nhave stood for an incarnation of vital force. One felt\\ninstinctively that her personality would be active rather than\\npassive--that the events which she attracted to herself would be\\nprofoundly emotional in their fulfilment.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the depressing hour she had just passed, and the\\nold vulgarity which had shocked her with a new violence, she was\\nconscious, moving to and fro in the shadows, of a strange\\nhappiness--of a warmth of feeling which pervaded her from head to\\nfoot, which fluttered in her temples and burned like firelight in\\nher open palms. The place was home to her, she realised at last,\\nand the surroundings of her married life--the foreign towns and\\nthe enchanting Italian scenery--showed in her memory with a\\ndistant and alien beauty. Here was what she loved, for here was\\nher right, her heritage--the desolate red roads, the luxuriant\\ntobacco fields, the primitive and ignorant people. In her heart\\nthere was no regret for any past that she had known, for over the\\nwild country stretching about her now there hung a romantic and\\nmysterious haze.\\n\\nA little later she was aroused from her reverie by Miss Saidie,\\nwho came in with a lighted lamp in her hand.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you need a light, Maria? I never could abide to sit in the\\ndark.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes; bring it in. There, put it on the bureau and sit down\\nby the fire, for I want to talk to you. No, I\\'m not a bit tired;\\nI am only trying to fit myself again in this room. Why, I don\\'t\\nbelieve you\\'ve changed a pin in the pincushion since I went\\naway.\"\\n\\nMiss Saidie dusted the top of the bureau with her apron before\\nshe placed the tall glass lamp upon it.\\n\\n\"Thar warn\\'t anybody to stay in it,\" she answered, as she sat\\ndown in a deep, cretonne-covered chair and pushed back the\\nhickory log with her foot. \"I declare, Maria, I don\\'t see what\\nyou want to traipse around with that little poor-folksy yaller\\ndog for. He puts me in mind of the one that old blind nigger up\\nthe road used to have.\"\\n\\n\"Does he?\" asked Maria absently, in the voice of one whose\\nthoughts are hopelessly astray.\\n\\nShe was standing by the window, holding aside the curtain of\\nflowered chintz, and after a moment she added curiously: \"There\\'s\\na light in the fields, Aunt Saidie. What does it mean?\"\\n\\nCrossing the room, Miss Saidie followed the gesture with which\\nMaria pointed into the night.\\n\\n\"That\\'s on the Blake place,\" she said; \"it must be Mr.\\nChristopher moving about with his lantern.\"\\n\\n\"You call him Mr. Christopher?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it slipped out. His father\\'s name was Christopher before\\nhim, and I used to open the gate for him when I was a child. Many\\nand many a time the old gentleman\\'s given me candy out of his\\npocket, or a quarter to buy a present, and one Christmas he\\nbrought me a real wax doll from the city. He wasn\\'t old then, I\\ncan tell you, and he was as handsome as if he had stepped out of\\na fashion plate. Why, young Mr. Christopher can\\'t hold a candle\\nto him for looks.\"\\n\\n\"He was a gentleman, then? I mean the old man.\"\\n\\n\"Who? Mr. Christopher\\'s father? I don\\'t reckon thar was a freer\\nor a finer between here and London.\"\\n\\nMaria\\'s gaze was still on the point of light which twinkled\\nfaintly here and there in the distant field.\\n\\n\"Then how, in heaven\\'s name, did he come to this?\" she asked, in\\na voice that was hardly louder than a whisper.\\n\\n\"I never knew; I never knew,\" protested Miss Saidie, going back\\nto her chair beside the hearth. \"Brother Bill and he hate each\\nother worse than death, and it was Will\\'s fancy for Mr.\\nChristopher that brought on this awful trouble. For a time, I\\ndeclare it looked as if the boy was really bewitched, and they\\nwere together morning, noon, and night. Your grandpa never got\\nover it, and I believe he blames Mr. Christopher for every last\\nthing that\\'s happened--Molly Peterkin and all.\"\\n\\n\"Molly Peterkin?\" repeated Maria inquiringly. \"Why, how absurd!\\nAnd, after all, what is the matter with the girl?\" Dropping the\\ncurtain, she came over to the fire, and sat listening attentively\\nwhile Miss Saidie told, in spasmodic jerks and pauses, the\\nfoolish story of Will\\'s marriage.\\n\\n\"Your grandpa will never forgive him--never, never. He has turned\\nhim out for good and all, and he talks now of leaving every cent\\nof his money to foreign missions.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll see,\" said Maria soothingly. \"I\\'ll go over there to-\\nmorrow and talk with Will, and then I\\'ll try to bring grandfather\\nto some kind of reason. He can\\'t let them starve, rich as he is,\\nthere\\'s no sense in that--and if the worst comes, I can at least\\nshare the little I have with them. It may supply them with bread,\\nif Molly will undertake to churn her own butter.\"\\n\\n\"Then your money went, too?\"\\n\\n\"The greater part of it. Jack was fond of wild schemes, you know.\\nI left it in his hands.\" She had pronounced the dead man\\'s name\\nso composedly that Miss Saidie, after an instant\\'s hesitation,\\nbrought herself to an allusion to the girl\\'s loss.\\n\\n\"How you must miss him, dear,\" she ventured timidly; \"even if he\\nwasn\\'t everything he should have been to you, he was still your\\nhusband.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he was my husband,\" assented Maria quietly.\\n\\n\"You were so brave and so patient, and you stuck by him to the\\nlast, as a wife ought to do. Then thar\\'s not even a child left to\\nyou now.\"\\n\\nMaria turned slowly toward her and then looked away again into\\nthe fire. The charred end of a lightwood knot had fallen on the\\nstones, and, picking it up, she threw it back into the flames.\\n\"For a year before his death his mind was quite gone,\" she said\\nin a voice that quivered slightly; \"he had to be taken to an\\nasylum, but I went with him and nursed him till he died. There\\nwere times when he would allow no one else to enter his room or\\neven bring him his meals. I have sat by him for two days and\\nnights without sleeping, and though he did not recognise me, he\\nwould not let me stir from my place.\"\\n\\n\"And yet he treated you very badly--even his family said so.\"\\n\\n\"That is all over now, and we were both to blame. I owed him\\nreparation, and I made it, thank God, at the last.\"\\n\\nAs she raised her bare arms to the cushioned back of her chair\\nMiss Saidie caught a glimpse of a deep white scar which ran in a\\njagged line above her elbow.\\n\\n\"Oh, it is nothing, nothing,\" said Maria hastily, clasping her\\nhands again upon her knees. \"That part of my life is over and\\ndone with and may rest in peace. I forgave him then, and he\\nforgives me now. One always forgives when one understands, you\\nknow, and we both understand to-day--he no less than I. The chief\\nthing was that we made a huge, irretrievable mistake--the mistake\\nthat two people make when they think that love can be coddled and\\nnursed like a domestic pet--when they forget that it goes wild\\nand free and comes at no man\\'s call. Folly like that is its own\\npunishment, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, my dear,\" gasped Miss Saidie, in awe-stricken sympathy\\nbefore the wild remorse in Maria\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"I did my duty, as you call it; I even clung to it desperately,\\nand, much as I hated it, I never rebelled for a single instant.\\nThe nearest I came to loving him, I think, was when, after our\\nterrible life together, he lay helpless for a year and I was with\\nhim day and night. If I could have given him my strength then,\\nbrain and body, I would have done it gladly, and that agonised\\ncompassion was the strongest feeling I ever had for him.\" She\\nbroke off for a long breath, and sat looking earnestly at the\\namazed little woman across from her. \"You could never\\nunderstand!\" she exclaimed impetuously, \"but I must tell you--I\\nmust tell you because I can\\'t live with you day after day and\\nknow that there is an old dead lie between us. I hate lies, I\\nhave had so many of them, and I shall speak the truth hereafter,\\nno matter what comes of it. Anything is better than a long,\\nwearing falsehood, or than those hideous little shams that we\\nwere always afraid to touch for fear they would melt and show us\\nour own nakedness. That is what I loathe about my life, and that\\nis what I\\'ve done with now forever. I am myself now for the first\\ntime since I was born, and at last I shall let my own nature\\nteach me how to live.\"\\n\\nHer intense pallor was illumined suddenly by a white flame,\\nwhether from the leaping of some inner emotion or from the\\nsinking firelight which blazed up fitfully Miss Saidie could not\\ntell. As she turned her head with an impatient movement her black\\nhair slipped its heavy coil and spread in a shadowy mass upon her\\nbared shoulders.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know how it is,\" said Miss Saidie, wiping her\\neyes. \"But I can\\'t see that it makes any difference whether you\\nwere what they call in love or not, so long as you were a good,\\nwell-behaved wife. I don\\'t think a man troubles himself much\\nabout a woman\\'s heart after he\\'s put his wedding ring on her\\nfinger; and though I know, of course, that thar\\'s a lot of\\nnonsense spoken in courtship, it seems to me they mostly take it\\nout in talking. The wives that I\\'ve seen are generally as anxious\\nabout thar setting hens as they are about thar husband\\'s hearts,\\nand I reckon things are mighty near the same the world over.\"\\n\\nWithout noticing her, Maria went on feverishly, speaking so low\\nat times that the other almost lost the words.\\n\\n\"It is such a relief to let it all out,\" she said, with a long,\\nsighing breath, \"and oh! if I had loved him it would have been so\\ndifferent--so different. Then I might have saved him; for what\\nevil is strong enough to contend against a love which would have\\nborne all things, have covered all things?\"\\n\\nRising from her chair, she walked rapidly up and down, and\\npausing at last beside the window, lifted the curtain and looked\\nout into the night.\\n\\n\"I might have saved him; I know it now,\" she repeated slowly: \"or\\nhad it been otherwise, even in madness I would not have loosened\\nmy arms, and my service would have been the one passionate\\ndelight left in my life. They could never have torn him from my\\nbosom then, and yet as it was--as it was--\" She turned quickly,\\nand, coming back, laid her hand on Miss Saidie\\'s arm. \"It is such\\na comfort to talk, dear Aunt Saidie,\" she added, \"even though you\\ndon\\'t understand half that I say. But you are good--so good; and\\nnow if you\\'ll lend me a nightgown I\\'ll go to bed and sleep until\\nmy trunks come in the morning.\" Her voice had regained its old\\ncomposure, and Miss Saidie, looking back as she went for the\\ngown, saw that she had begun quietly to braid her hair.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. The Day Afterward\\n\\nWhen Maria awoke, the sun was full in her eyes, and somewhere on\\nthe lawn outside the first bluebird was whistling. With a start,\\nshe sprang out of bed and dressed quickly by the wood fire which\\nMalindy had lighted. Then, before going downstairs, she raised\\nthe window and leaned out into the freshness of the morning,\\nwhere a white mist glimmered in the hollows of the March\\nlandscape. In the distance she saw the smoking chimneys of the\\nBlake cottage, very faint among the leafless trees, and nearer at\\nhand men were moving back and forth in her grandfather\\'s fields.\\nSix years ago she would have found little beauty in so grave and\\ncolourless a scene, but to-day as she looked upon it a peace such\\nas she had never known possessed her thoughts. The wisdom of\\nexperience was hers now, and with it she had gained something of\\nthe deeper insight into nature which comes to the soul that is\\nreconciled with the unknown laws which it obeys.\\n\\nGoing down a few moments later, she found that breakfast was\\nalready over, and that Miss Saidie was washing the tea things at\\nthe head of the bared table.\\n\\n\"Why, it seems but a moment since I fell asleep,\" said Maria, as\\nshe drew back her chair. \"How long has grandfather been up?\"\\n\\n\"Since before daybreak. He is just starting to town, and he\\'s in\\na terrible temper because the last batch of butter ain\\'t up to\\nthe mark, he says. I\\'m sure I don\\'t see why it ain\\'t, for I\\nworked every pound of it with my own hands--but thar ain\\'t no\\nrule for pleasing men, and never will be till God Almighty sets\\nthe universe rolling upside down. That\\'s the wagon you hear now.\\nThank heaven, he won\\'t be back till after dark.\"\\n\\nWith a gesture of relief Maria applied herself to the buttered\\nwaffles before her, prepared evidently in her honour, and then\\nafter a short silence, in which she appeared to weigh carefully\\nher unuttered words, she announced her intention of paying\\nimmediately her visit to Will and Molly.\\n\\n\"Oh, you can\\'t, you can\\'t,\" groaned Miss Saidie, nervously\\nmopping out the inside of a cup. \"For heaven\\'s sake, don\\'t raise\\nanother cloud of dust jest as we\\'re beginning to see clear\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t tell me I can\\'t when I must,\" responded Maria, pushing\\naway her plate and rising from the table; \"there\\'s no such word\\nas \\'can\\'t\\' when one has to, you know. I\\'ll be back in two hours\\nat the most, and oh! with so much to tell you!\"\\n\\nAfter tying on her hat in the hall, she looked in again to\\nlighten Miss Saidie\\'s foreboding by a tempting bait of news; but\\nwhen she had descended the steps and walked slowly along the\\ndrive under the oaks, the assumed brightness of her look faded as\\nrapidly as the morning sunshine on the clay road before her. It\\nwas almost with dismay that she found herself covering the ground\\nbetween the Hall and Will\\'s home and saw the shaded lane\\nstretching to the little farm adjoining Sol Peterkin\\'s.\\n\\nAs she passed the store, Mrs. Spade, who was selling white china\\nbuttons to Eliza Field, leaned over the counter and stared in\\namazement through the open window.\\n\\n\"Bless my soul an\\' body, if thar ain\\'t old Fletcher\\'s\\ngranddaughter come back!\" she exclaimed--\"holdin\\' her head as\\nhigh as ever, jest as if her husband hadn\\'t beat her black an\\'\\nblue. Well, well, times have slid down hill sence I was a gal,\\nan\\' the women of to-day ain\\'t got the modesty they used to be\\nborn with. Why, I remember the time when old Mrs. Beale in the\\nnext county used to go to bed for shame, with a mustard plaster,\\nevery time her husband took a drop too much, which he did every\\nblessed Saturday that he lived. It tided him over the Sabbath\\nmighty well, he used to say, for he never could abide the sermons\\nof Mr. Grant.\"\\n\\nEliza dropped the buttons she had picked up and turned, craning\\nher neck in the direction of Maria\\'s vanishing figure.\\n\\n\"What on earth has she gone down Sol Peterkin\\'s lane for?\" she\\ninquired suspiciously.\\n\\n\"The Lord knows; if it\\'s to visit her brother, I may say it\\'s a\\nlong ways mo\\'n I\\'d do.\"\\n\\n\"She was always a queer gal even befo\\' her marriage--so strange\\nan\\' far-away lookin\\' that I declar\\' it used to scare me half to\\ndeath to meet her all alone at dusk. I never could help feelin\\'\\nthat she could bewitch a body, if she wanted to, with those\\nsolemn black eyes.\"\\n\\n\"She ain\\'t bewitched me,\" returned Mrs. Spade decisively \"an\\'\\nwhat\\'s mo\\', she\\'s had too many misfortune come to her to make me\\nbelieve she ain\\'t done somethin\\' to deserve \\'em. Thar\\'s mighty\\nfew folks gets worse than they deserve in this world, an\\' when\\nyou see a whole flock of troubles settle on a person\\'s head you\\nmay rest right sartain thar\\'s a long score of misbehaviours up\\nagin \\'em. Yes, ma\\'am; when I hear of a big misfortune happenin\\'\\nto anybody that I know, the first question that pops into my head\\nis: \\'I wonder if they\\'ve broke the sixth this time or jest the\\ncommon seventh?\\' The best rule to follow, accordin\\' to my way of\\nthinkin\\', is to make up yo\\' mind right firm that no matter what\\nevil falls upon a person it ain\\'t nearly so bad as the good Lord\\nought to have made it.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a real pious way of lookin\\' at things, I reckon,\" sighed\\nEliza deferentially, as she fished five cents from the deep\\npocket of her purple calico and slapped it down upon the counter;\\n\"but we ain\\'t all such good church-goers as you, the mo\\'s the\\npity.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m moral, an\\' I make no secret of it, \"replied Mrs. Spade.\\n\"It\\'s writ plain all over me, an\\' it has been ever sence the day\\nthat I was born. \\'That\\'s as moral lookin\\' a baby as ever I saw,\\'\\nwas what Doctor Pierson said to ma when I wan\\'t mo\\'n two hours\\nold. It was so then, an\\' it\\'s been so ever sence. \\'Virtue may not\\ntake the place of beaux,\\' my po\\' ma used to say, \\'but it will\\nease her along mighty well without \\'em\\'--Yes, the buttons are\\nfive cents. To be sure, I\\'ll watch out and let you hear if she\\ncomes this way again.\"\\n\\nMaria, meanwhile, happily unconscious of the judgment of her\\nneighbours, walked thoughtfully along the lane until she came in\\nsight of the small tumbled-down cottage which had been Fletcher\\'s\\nwedding gift to his grandson. A man in blue jean clothes was\\nploughing the field on the left of the road, and it was only when\\nsomething vaguely familiar in his dejected attitude caused her to\\nturn for a second glance that she realised, with a pang, that he\\nwas Will.\\n\\nAt her startled cry he looked up from the horses he was driving,\\nand then, letting the ropes fall, came slowly toward her across\\nthe faint purple furrows. All the boyish jauntiness she\\nremembered was gone from his appearance; his reversion to the\\nfamily type had been complete, and it came to her with a shock\\nthat held her motionless that he stood to-day where her\\ngrandfather had stood fifty years before.\\n\\n\"Will!\" she gasped, with an impulsive, motherly movement of her\\narms. Rejecting her caress with an impatient shrug, he stood\\nkicking nervously at a clod of earth, his eyes wavering in a\\ndispirited survey of her face.\\n\\n\"Well, it seems that we have both made a blamed mess of things,\"\\nhe said at last.\\n\\nMaria shook her head, smiling hopefully. \"Not too bad a mess to\\nstraighten out, dear,\" she answered. \"We must set to work at once\\nand begin to mend matters. Ah, if you had only written me how\\nthings were!\"\\n\\n\"What was the use?\" asked Will doggedly. \"It was all grandpa--he\\nturned out the devil himself, and there was no putting up with\\nhim. He\\'ll live forever, too; that\\'s the worst of it!\"\\n\\n\"But you did anger him very much, Will--and you might so easily\\nhave waited. Surely, you were both young enough.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it wasn\\'t all about Molly, you know, when it comes to that.\\nLong before I married he had made my life a burden to me. It all\\nbegan with his insane jealousy of Christopher Blake--\"\\n\\n\"Of Christopher Blake?\" repeated Maria, and fell a step away from\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Blake has been a deuced good friend to me,\" insisted Will;\\n\"that\\'s what the old man hates--what he\\'s hated steadily all\\nalong. The whole trouble started when I wouldn\\'t choose my\\nfriends to please him; and when at last I undertook to pick out\\nmy own wife there was hell to pay.\"\\n\\nMaria\\'s gaze wandered inquiringly in the direction of the house,\\nwhich had a disordered and thriftless air.\\n\\n\"Is she here?\" she asked, not without a slight nervousness in her\\nvoice.\\n\\nWill followed her glance, and, taking off his big straw hat,\\npulled at the shoestring tied tightly around the crown.\\n\\n\"Not now; but you\\'ll see her some day, when she\\'s dressed up, and\\nI tell you she\\'ll be worth your looking at. All she needs is a\\nlittle money to turn her into the most tearing beauty you ever\\nsaw.\"\\n\\n\"And she\\'s not at home?\"\\n\\n\"Not now,\" he replied impatiently; \"her mother has just come over\\nand taken her off. I say, Maria,\" he lowered his voice, and an\\neager look came into his irresolute face, which already showed\\nthe effects of heavy drinking, \"this can\\'t keep up, you know; it\\nreally can\\'t. We must have money, for there\\'s a child coming in\\nthe autumn.\"\\n\\n\"A child!\" exclaimed Maria, startled. \"Oh, Will! Will!\" She\\nglanced round again at the barren landscape and the squalid\\nlittle house; \"then something must be done at once--there\\'s no\\ntime to lose. I\\'ll speak to grandfather about it this very\\nnight.\"\\n\\n\"At least, there\\'s no harm in trying,\" said Will, catching\\ndesperately at the suggestion. \"Even if you don\\'t make things\\nbetter, there\\'s a kind of comfort in the thought that you can\\'t\\nmake them worse. We\\'re at the bottom of the hill already. So, if\\nyou don\\'t pull us up, at least you won\\'t push us any farther\\ndown.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll pull you up, never fear; but you must give me time.\"\\n\\n\"Your own affairs are in rather a muddle I reckon, by now?\"\\n\\n\"Hopeless, it seems; but I\\'ll share with you the few hundreds I\\nstill have. I brought this to-day, thinking you might be in\\nimmediate need.\"\\n\\nAs she drew the little roll of bills from her pocket, Will\\nreached out eagerly, and, seizing it from her, counted it\\ngreedily in her presence. \"Well, you\\'re a downright brick,\\nMaria,\" he remarked, as he thrust it hastily into his shirt.\\n\\nDisappointment had chilled Maria\\'s enthusiasm a little, but the\\nnext instant she dismissed the feeling as ungenerous, and slipped\\nher hand affectionately through his arm as he walked back with\\nher into the road.\\n\\n\"I wish I could see Molly,\" she said again, her eyes on the\\nhouse, where she caught a glimpse of a bright head withdrawn from\\none of the windows.\\n\\n\"She is over at her mother\\'s, I told you,\" returned Will\\nirritably, and then, stooping to kiss her hurriedly, he added in\\na persuasive voice: \"Bring the old man to reason, Maria; it\\'s\\nlife or death, remember.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do my best, Will; I\\'ll go on my knees to him to-night.\"\\n\\n\"Does he dislike you as much as ever?\"\\n\\n\"No; he rather fancies me, I think. Last evening he grew almost\\namiable, and this morning Aunt Saidie told me he left me a pound\\nof fresh butter from the market jar. If you only knew how fond\\nhe\\'s grown of his money you would realise what it means.\"\\n\\n\"Well, keep it up, for God\\'s sake. Humour him for all he\\'s worth.\\nCoddle and coax him into doing something for us, or dying and\\nleaving us his money.\"\\n\\nMaria\\'s face grew grave. \"That\\'s the serious part, Will; he talks\\nof leaving every penny he has to foreign missions.\"\\n\\n\"The devil!\" cried Will furiously. \"If he does, I hope he\\'ll land\\nin hell. Don\\'t let him, Maria. It all rests with you. Why, if he\\ndid, you\\'d starve along with us, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you needn\\'t think of me--I could always teach, you know, and\\na little money buys a great deal of happiness with me. I have\\nlearned that great wealth is almost as much of an evil as great\\npoverty.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d take the risk of it, every time; and he is beastly rich,\\nisn\\'t he, Maria?\"\\n\\n\"One of the very richest men in the State, they told me at the\\ncross-roads.\"\\n\\n\"Yet he has the insolence to cut me off without a dollar. Look at\\nthis petered-out little farm he\\'s given me. Why, it doesn\\'t bring\\nin enough to feed a darkey!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll hope for better things, dear; but you must learn to be\\npatient--very patient. His anger has been smothered so long that\\nit has grown almost as settled as hate. Aunt Saidie doesn\\'t dare\\nmention your name to him, and she tells me that if I so much as\\nspeak of you he\\'ll turn me out of doors.\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s even worse than I thought.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps. I can\\'t say, for I haven\\'t approached the subject even\\nremotely as yet. Keep your courage, however, and I promise you to\\ndo my best.\"\\n\\nShe kissed him again, and then, turning her face homeward,\\nstarted at a rapid walk down the lane. The interview with Will\\nhad disturbed her more than she liked to admit, and it was with a\\npositive throb of pain that she forced herself at last to compare\\nthe boy of five years ago with the broken and dispirited man from\\nwhom she had just parted. Was this tragedy the end of the young\\nambition which Fletcher had nursed so fondly, this--a nervous,\\noverworked tobacco-grower, with bloodshot eyes, and features\\nalready inflamed by reckless drinking? The tears sprang to her\\nlashes, and, throwing up her hands with a pathetic gesture of\\nprotest, she hastened on homeward as if to escape the terror that\\npursued her.\\n\\nShe had turned from the lane into the main road, and was just\\napproaching the great chestnuts which grew near the abandoned\\nice-pond, when, looking up suddenly at the call of a bird above\\nher head, she saw Christopher Blake standing beside the rail\\nfence and watching her with a strong and steady gaze.\\nInvoluntarily she slackened her pace and waited, smiling for him\\nto cross the fence; but, to her amazement, after an instant in\\nwhich his eyes held her as if rooted to the spot, he turned\\nhastily away and walked rapidly in the opposite direction. For a\\nbreath she stood motionless, gazing blankly into space; then, as\\nshe went on again, she knew that she carried with her not the\\nwonder at his sudden flight, but the clear memory of that one\\nmoment\\'s look into his eyes. A century of experience, with its\\ntears and its laughter, its joy and its anguish, its desire and\\nits fulfilment, seemed crowded into the single instant that held\\nher immovable in the road.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. The Meeting in the Night\\n\\nWhen Christopher turned so abruptly from Maria\\'s gaze he was\\nconscious only of a desperate impulse of flight. At the instant\\nhis strength seemed to fail him utterly, and he realised that for\\nthe first time in his life he feared to trust himself to face the\\nimminent moment. His one thought was to escape quickly from her\\npresence, and in the suddenness of his retreat he did not weigh\\nthe possible effect upon her of his rudeness. A little later,\\nhowever, when he had put the field between him and her haunting\\neyes, he found himself returning with remorse to his imaginings\\nof what her scattered impressions must have been.\\n\\nBetween regret and perplexity the day dragged through, and he met\\nhis mother\\'s exacting humours and Cynthia\\'s wistful inquiries\\nwith a curious detachment of mind. He had reached that middle\\nstate of any powerful emotion when even the external objects\\namong which one moves seem affected by the inward struggle\\nbetween reason and desire--the field in which he worked, the\\ndistant landscape, the familiar faces in the house, and those\\nfrail, pathetic gestures of his mother\\'s hands, all expressed in\\noutward forms something of the passion which he felt stirring in\\nhis own breast. It was in his nature to dare risks blindly--to\\nhesitate at no experience offered him in his narrow life, and\\nthere were moments during this long day when he found himself\\nquestioning if one might not, after all, plunge headlong into the\\nimpossible.\\n\\nAs he rose from the supper table, where he had pushed his\\nuntasted food impatiently away, he remembered that he had\\npromised in the morning to meet Will Fletcher at the store, and,\\nlighting his lantern, he started out to keep the appointment he\\nhad almost forgotten. He found Will overflowing with his domestic\\ntroubles, and it was after ten o\\'clock before they both came out\\nupon the road and turned into opposite ways at the beginning of\\nSol Peterkin\\'s lane.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll help you with the ploughing, of course,\" Christopher said,\\nas they lingered together a moment before parting; \"make your\\nmind quite easy about that. I\\'ll be over at sunrise on Monday and\\nput in a whole day\\'s job.\"\\n\\nThen, as he fell back into his own road, he found something like\\nsatisfaction in the prospect of driving Will Fletcher\\'s plough.\\nThe easy indifference with which he was accustomed to lend a hand\\nin a neighbour\\'s difficulty had always marked his association\\nwith the man whose ruin, he still assured himself, he had\\nwrought.\\n\\nIt was a dark, moonless night, with only a faint, nebulous\\nwhiteness where the clouded stars shone overhead. His lantern,\\nswinging lightly from his hand, cast a shining yellow circle on\\nthe ground before him, and it was by this illumination that he\\nsaw presently, as he neared the sunken road into which he was\\nabout to turn, a portion of the shadow by the ice-pond detach\\nitself from the surrounding blackness and drift rapidly to meet\\nhim. In his first start of surprise, he raised the lantern\\nquickly above his head and waited breathlessly while the\\nadvancing shape assumed gradually a woman\\'s form. The old ghost\\nstories of his childhood thronged confusedly into his brain, and\\nthen, before the thrilling certainty of the figure before him, he\\nuttered a single joyous exclamation:\\n\\n\"You!\"\\n\\nThe light flashed full upon Maria\\'s face, which gave back to him\\na white and tired look. Her eyes were heavy, and there was a\\nstrange solemnity about them--something that appealed vaguely to\\nhis religious instinct.\\n\\n\"What in heaven\\'s name has happened?\" he asked, and his voice\\nescaped his control and trembled with emotion.\\n\\nWith a tired little laugh, she screened her eyes from the\\nlantern.\\n\\n\"I had a talk with grandfather about Will,\" she answered, \"and he\\ngot so angry that he locked me out of doors. He had had a\\nworrying day in town, and I think he hardly knew what he was\\ndoing--but he has put up the bars and turned out the lights, and\\nthere\\'s really no way of getting in.\"\\n\\nHe thought for a moment. \"Will you go on to your brother\\'s, or is\\nit too far?\"\\n\\n\"At first I started there, but that must have been hours ago, and\\nit was so dark I got lost by the ice-pond. After all, it would\\nonly make matters worse if I saw Will again; so the question is,\\nWhere am I to sleep?\"\\n\\n\"At Tom Spade\\'s, then--or--\" he hesitated an instant, \"if you\\ncare to come to us, my sister will gladly find room for you.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"No, no; you are very kind, but I can\\'t do\\nthat. It is best that I shouldn\\'t leave the place, perhaps, and\\nwhen the servant comes over at sunrise I can slip up into my\\nroom. If you\\'ll lend me your lantern I\\'ll make myself some kind\\nof a bed in the barn. Fortunately, grandfather forgot to lock the\\ndoor.\"\\n\\n\"In the barn?\" he echoed, surprised.\\n\\n\"Oh, I went there first, but after I lay down I suddenly\\nremembered the mice and got up and came away. I\\'m mortally afraid\\nof mice in the dark; but your lantern will keep them off, will it\\nnot?\"\\n\\nShe smiled at him from the shining circle which surrounded her\\nlike a halo, and for a moment he forgot her words in the\\nwonderful sense of her nearness. Around them the night stretched\\nlike a cloak, enclosing them in an emotional intimacy which had\\nall the warmth of a caress. As she leaned back against the body\\nof a tree, and he drew forward that he might hold the lantern\\nabove her head, the situation was resolved, in spite of the\\neffort that he made, into the eternal problem of the man and the\\nwoman. He was aware that his blood worked rapidly in his veins,\\nand as her glance reached upward from the light to meet his in\\nthe shadow he realised with the swiftness of intuition that in\\nher also the appeal of the silence was faced with a struggle.\\nThey would ignore it, he knew, and yet it shone in their eyes,\\nquivered in their voices, and trembled in their divided hands;\\nand to them both its presence was alive and evident in the space\\nbetween them. He saw her bosom rise and fall, her lips part\\nslightly, and a tremor disturb the high serenity of her\\nself-control, and there came to him the memory of their first\\nmeeting at the cross-roads and of the mystery and the rapture of\\nhis boyish love. He had found her then the lady of his dreams,\\nand now, after all the violence of his revolt against her, she\\nwas still to him as he had first seen her--the woman whose soul\\nlooked at him from her face.\\n\\nFor a breathless moment--for a single heart-beat--it seemed to\\nhim that he had but to lean down and gather her eyes and lips and\\nhands to his embrace, to feel her awaken to life within his arms\\nand her warm blood leap up beneath his mouth. Then the madness\\nleft him as suddenly as it had come, and she grew strangely\\nwhite, and distant, and almost unreal, in the spiritual beauty of\\nher look. He caught his breath sharply, and lowered his gaze to\\nthe yellow circle that trembled on the ground.\\n\\n\"But you will be afraid even with the light,\" he said, in a voice\\nwhich had grown almost expressionless.\\n\\nAs if awaking suddenly from sleep, she passed her hand slowly\\nacross her eyes.\\n\\n\"No, I shall not be afraid with the light,\" she answered, and\\nmoved out into the road.\\n\\n\"Then let me hold it for you--the hill is very rocky.\"\\n\\nShe assented silently, and quickened her steps down the long\\nincline; then, as she stumbled in the darkness, he threw the\\nlantern over upon her side. \"If you will lean on me I think I can\\nsteady you,\" he suggested, waiting until she turned and laid her\\nhand upon his arm. \"That\\'s better now; go slowly and leave the\\nroad to me. How in thunder did you come over it in the pitch\\ndark?\"\\n\\n\"I fell several times,\" she replied, with a little unsteady\\nlaugh, \"and my feet are oh! so hurt and bruised. Tomorrow I shall\\ngo on crutches.\"\\n\\n\"A bad night\\'s work, then.\"\\n\\n\"But not so bad as it might have been,\" she added cheerfully.\\n\\n\"You mean if I had not found you it would have been worse. Well,\\nI\\'m glad that much good has come out of it. I have spared you a\\ncold--so that goes down to my credit; otherwise--But what\\ndifference does it make?\" he finished impatiently. \"We must have\\nmet sooner or later even if I had run across the world instead of\\nmerely across a tobacco field. After all, the world is no bigger\\nthan a tobacco field, when it comes to destiny.\"\\n\\n\"To destiny?\" she looked up, startled. \"Then there are fatalists\\neven among tobacco-growers?\"\\n\\nHe met her question with a laugh. \"But I wasn\\'t always a tobacco-\\ngrower, and there were poets before Homer, who is about the only\\none I\\'ve ever read. It\\'s true I\\'ve tried to lose the little\\neducation I ever had--that I\\'ve done my best to come down to the\\nlevel of my own cattle; but I\\'m not an ox, after all, except in\\nstrength, and one has plenty of time to think when one works in\\nthe field all day. Why, the fancies I\\'ve had would positively\\nturn your head.\"\\n\\n\"Fancies--about what?\"\\n\\n\"About life and death and the things one wants and can never get.\\nI dream dreams and plot unimaginable evil--\"\\n\\n\"Not evil,\" she protested.\\n\\n\"Whole crops of it; and harvest them, too.\"\\n\\n\"But why?\"\\n\\n\"For pure pleasure--for sheer beastly love of the devilment I\\ncan\\'t do.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head, treating his words as a jest.\\n\\n\"There was never evil that held its head so high.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s pride, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Nor that wore so frank a face.\"\\n\\n\"And that\\'s hypocrisy.\"\\n\\n\"Nor that dared to be so rude.\"\\n\\nHe caught up her laugh.\\n\\n\"You have me there, I grant you. What a brute I must have seemed\\nthis morning.\"\\n\\n\"You were certainly not a Chesterfield--nor a Bolivar Blake.\"\\n\\nWith a start he looked down upon her. \"Then you, too, are aware\\nof the old chap?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Of Bolivar Blake--why, who isn\\'t? I used to be taught one of his\\nmaxims as a child--\\'If you can\\'t tell a polite lie, don\\'t tell\\nany.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Good manners, but rather bad morality, eh?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, the two things seem to run together,\" she\\nreplied; \"which encourages me to hope that you will prove to be a\\npattern of virtue.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t hope too hard. I may merely have lost the one trait\\nwithout developing the other.\"\\n\\n\"At least, it does no harm to believe the best,\" she returned in\\nthe same careless tone. Ahead of them, where the great oaks were\\nmassed darkly against the sky, he saw the steep road splotched\\ninto the surrounding blackness. Her soft breathing came to him\\nfrom the obscurity at his side, and he felt his arm burn beneath\\nthe light pressure of her hand. For the first time in his lonely\\nand isolated life he knew the quickened emotion, the fulness of\\nexperience, which came to him with the touch of the woman whom,\\nhe still told himself, he could never love. Not to love her had\\nbeen so long for him a point of pride as well as of honour that\\neven while the wonderful glow pervaded his thoughts, while his\\npulses drummed madly in his temples, he held himself doggedly to\\nthe illusion that the appeal she made would vanish with the\\nmorning. It was a delirium of the senses, he still reasoned, and\\nknew even as the lie was spoken that the charm which drew him to\\nher was, above all things, the spirit speaking through the flesh.\\n\\n\"I fear I have been a great bother to you,\" said Maria, after a\\nmoment, \"but you will probably solace yourself with the\\nreflection that destiny would have prepared an equal nuisance had\\nyou gone along another road.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" he answered, smiling; \"but philosophy sometimes fails\\na body, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"It may be. I knew a man once who said he leaned upon two\\ncrutches, philosophy and religion. When one broke under him he\\nthrew his whole weight on the other--and lo! that gave way.\"\\n\\n\"Then he went down, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"I never heard the end--but if it wasn\\'t quite so dark, you would\\nfind me really covered with confusion. I have not only brought\\nyou a good mile out of your road, but I am now prepared to rob\\nyou of your light. Can you possibly find your way home in the\\ndark?\"\\n\\nAs she looked up, the lantern shone in his face, and she saw that\\nhe wore a whimsical smile.\\n\\n\"I have been in the dark all my life,\" he answered, \"until to-\\nnight.\"\\n\\n\"Until to-night?\"\\n\\n\"Until now--this very minute. For the first time for ten years I\\nbegin to see my road at this instant--to see where I have been\\nwalking all along.\"\\n\\n\"And where did it lead you?\"\\n\\nHe laughed at the seriousness in her voice.\\n\\n\"Through a muck-heap--in the steps of my own cattle. I am sunk\\nover the neck in it already.\"\\n\\nHer tone caught the lightness of his and carried it off with\\ngaiety.\\n\\n\"But there is a way out. Have you found it?\"\\n\\n\"There is none. I\\'ve wallowed so long in the filth that it has\\ncovered me.\"\\n\\n\"Surely it will rub off,\" she said.\\n\\nFor a moment the lantern\\'s flash rested upon his brow and eyes,\\nrelieving them against the obscurity which still enveloped his\\nmouth.\\n\\nThe high-bred lines of his profile stood out clear and fine as\\nthose of an ivory carving, and their very beauty saddened the\\nlook she turned upon him. Then the light fell suddenly lower and\\nrevealed the coarsened jaw, with the almost insolent strength of\\nthe closed lips. The whole effect was one of reckless power, and\\nshe caught her breath with the thought that so compelling a force\\nmight serve equally the agencies of good or evil.\\n\\nThey had reached the lawn, and as he responded to her hurried\\ngesture of silence they passed the house quickly and entered the\\ngreat open door of the barn. Here he hung the lantern from a\\nnail, and then, pulling down some straw from a pile in one\\ncorner, arranged it into the rude likeness of a pallet.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think the mice will trouble you,\" he said at last, as he\\nturned to go, \"but if they do--why, just call out and I\\'ll come\\nto slaughter--\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t go home, then?\" she asked, amazed.\\n\\nHe nodded carelessly.\\n\\n\"Not till daybreak. Remember, if you feel frightened, that I\\'m\\nwithin earshot.\"\\n\\nThen, before she could protest or detain him for an explanation,\\nhe turned from her and went out into the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. Maria Stands on Christopher\\'s Ground\\n\\nA broad yellow beam sliding under the door brought Maria into\\nsudden consciousness, and rising hastily from the straw, where\\nher figure had shaped an almost perfect outline, she crossed the\\ndusky floor smelling of trodden grain and went out into the early\\nsunshine, which slanted over the gray fields. A man trundling a\\nwheelbarrow from the market garden, and a milkmaid crossing the\\nlawn with a bucket of fresh milk, were the only moving figures in\\nthe landscape, and after a single hurried glance about her she\\nfollowed the straight road to the house and entered the rear\\ndoor, which Malindy had unlocked.\\n\\nMeeting Fletcher a little later at breakfast, she found, to her\\nsurprise, that he accepted her presence without question and made\\nabsolutely no allusion to the heated conversation of the evening\\nbefore. He looked sullen and dirty, as if he had slept all night\\nin his clothes, and he responded to Maria\\'s few good-humoured\\nremarks with a single abrupt nod over his coffee-cup. As she\\nwatched him a feeling of pity for his loneliness moved her heart,\\nand when he rose hastily at last and strode out into the hall she\\nfollowed him and spoke gently while he paused to take down his\\nhat from one of the old antlers near the door.\\n\\n\"If I could only be of some use to you, grandfather,\" she said;\\n\"are you sure there is nothing I can do?\"\\n\\nWith his hand still outstretched, he hesitated an instant and\\nstood looking down upon her, his heavy features wrinkling into a\\ngrin.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve nothing against you as a woman,\" he responded, \"but when\\nyou set up and begin to charge like a judge, I\\'ll be hanged if I\\ncan stand you.\"\\n\\n\"Then I won\\'t charge any more. I only want to help you and to do\\nwhat is best. If you would but let me make myself of some\\naccount.\"\\n\\nHe laughed not unkindly, and flecked with his stubby forefinger\\nat some crumbs which had lodged in the folds of his cravat.\\n\\n\"Then I reckon you\\'d better mix a batch of dough and feed the\\nturkeys,\" he replied, and touching her shoulder with his hat-\\nbrim, he went hurriedly out of doors.\\n\\nWhen he had disappeared beyond the last clump of shrubbery\\nbordering the drive, she remembered the lantern she had left\\nhanging in the barn, and, going to look for it, carried it\\nupstairs to her room. In the afternoon, however, it occurred to\\nher that Christopher would probably need the light by evening,\\nand swinging the handle over her arm, she set out across the\\nnewly ploughed fields toward the Blake cottage. The stubborn\\nrustic pride which would keep him from returning to the Hall\\naroused in her a frank, almost tender amusement. She had long ago\\nwearied of the trivial worldliness of life; in the last few years\\nthe shallowness of passion had seemed its crowning insult, and\\nover the absolute sincerity of her own nature the primal emotion\\nshe had heard in Christopher\\'s voice exerted a compelling charm.\\nThe makeshift of a conventional marriage had failed her utterly;\\nher soul had rejected the woman\\'s usual cheap compromise with\\nexternals; and in her almost puritan scorn of the vanities by\\nwhich she was surrounded she had attained the moral elevation\\nwhich comes to those who live by an inner standard of purity\\nrather than by outward forms. In the largeness of her nature\\nthere had been small room for regret or for wasted passion, and\\nuntil her meeting with Christopher on the day of her homecoming\\nhe had existed in her imagination only as a bright and impossible\\nmemory. Now, as she went rapidly forward along the little path\\nthat edged the field, she found herself wondering if, after all,\\nshe had worn unconsciously his ideal as an armour against the\\npetty temptations and the sudden melancholies of the last six\\nyears.\\n\\nAs she neared the fence that divided the two farms she saw him\\nwalking slowly along a newly turned furrow, and when he looked up\\nshe lifted the lantern and waved it in the air. Quickening his\\nsteps, he swung himself over the rail fence with a single bound,\\nand came to where she stood amid a dried fringe of last summer\\'s\\nyarrow.\\n\\n\"So you are none the worse for the night in the barn?\" he asked\\nanxiously.\\n\\n\"Why, I dreamed the most beautiful dreams,\" she replied, \"and I\\nhad the most perfect sleep in the world.\"\\n\\n\"Then the mice kept away?\"\\n\\n\"At least they didn\\'t wake me.\"\\n\\n\"I stayed within call until sunrise,\" he said quietly. \"You were\\nnot afraid?\"\\n\\nHer rare smile shone suddenly upon him, illumining the delicate\\npallor of her face. \"I knew that you were there,\" she answered.\\n\\nFor a moment he gazed steadily into her eyes, then with a\\ndecisive movement he took the lantern from her hand and turned as\\nthough about to go back to his work.\\n\\n\"It was very kind of you to bring this over,\" he said, pausing\\nbeside the fence.\\n\\n\"Kind? Why, what did you expect? I knew it might hang there\\nforever, but you would not come for it.\"\\n\\n\"No, I should not have come for it,\" he replied, swinging the\\nlantern against the rails with such force that the glass\\nshattered and fell in pieces to the ground.\\n\\n\"Why, what a shame!\" said Maria; \"and it is all my fault.\"\\n\\nA smile was on his face as he looked at her.\\n\\n\"You are right--it is all your fault,\" he repeated, while his\\ngaze dropped to the level of her lips and hung there for a\\nbreathless instant.\\n\\nWith an effort she broke the spell which had fallen over her,\\nand, turning from him, pointed to the old Blake graveyard on the\\nlittle hill.\\n\\n\"Those black cedars have tempted me for days,\" she said. \"Will\\nyou tell me what dust they guard so faithfully?\"\\n\\nHe followed her gesture with a frown.\\n\\n\"I will show you, if you like,\" he answered. \"It is the only spot\\non earth where I may offer you hospitality.\"\\n\\n\"Your people are buried there?\"\\n\\n\"For two hundred years. Will you come?\"\\n\\nWhile she hesitated, he tossed the lantern over into his field\\nand came closer to her side. \"Come,\" he repeated gently, and at\\nhis voice a faint flush spread slowly from her throat to the\\nloosened hair upon her forehead. The steady glow gave her face a\\nlight, a radiance, that he had never seen there until to-day.\\n\\n\"Yes, I will come if you wish it,\" she responded quietly.\\n\\nTogether they went slowly up the low, brown incline over the\\nclods of upturned earth. When they reached the bricked-up wall,\\nwhich had crumbled away in places, he climbed over into the bed\\nof periwinkle and then held out his hands to assist her in\\ndescending. \"Here, step into that hollow,\" he said, \"and don\\'t\\njump till I tell you. Ah, that\\'s it; now, I\\'m ready.\"\\n\\nAt his words, she made a sudden. spring forward, her dress caught\\non the wall, and she slipped lightly into his outstretched arms.\\nFor the half of a second he held her against his breast; then, as\\nshe released herself, he drew back and lifted his eves to meet\\nthe serene composure of her expression. He was conscious that his\\nown face flamed red hot, but to all outward seeming she had not\\nnoticed the incident which had so moved him. The calm distinction\\nof her bearing struck him as forcibly as it had done at their\\nfirst meeting. \"What a solemn place,\" she said, lowering her\\nvoice as she looked about her.\\n\\nFor answer he drew aside the screening boughs of a cedar and\\nmotioned to the discoloured marble slabs strewn thickly under the\\ntrees.\\n\\n\"Here are my people,\" he returned gravely. \"And here is my\\nground.\"\\n\\nPausing, she glanced down on his father\\'s grave, reading with\\ndifficulty the inscription beneath the dry dust from the cedars.\\n\\n\"He lived to be very old,\" she said, after a moment.\\n\\n\"Seventy years. He lived exactly ten years too long.\"\\n\\n\"Too long?\"\\n\\n\"Those last ten years wrecked him. Had he died at sixty he would\\nhave died happy.\"\\n\\nHe turned from her, throwing himself upon the carpet of\\nperiwinkle, and coming to where he lay, she sat down on a granite\\nslab at his side.\\n\\n\"One must believe that there is a purpose in it,\" she responded,\\nraising a handful of fine dust and sifting it through her\\nfingers, \"or one would go mad over the mystery of things.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I dare say the purpose was to make me a tobacco-grower,\"\\nhe replied grimly, \"and if so, it has fulfilled itself in a\\nprecious way. Why, there\\'s never been a time since I was ten\\nyears old when I wouldn\\'t have changed places, and said \\'thank\\nyou,\\' too, with any one of those old fellows over there. They\\nwere jolly chaps, I tell you, and led jolly lives. It used to be\\nsaid of them that they never won a penny nor missed a kiss.\"\\n\\n\"Nor learned a lesson, evidently. Well, may they rest in peace;\\nbut I\\'m not sure that their wisdom would carry far. There are\\nbetter things than gaming and kissing, when all is said.\"\\n\\n\"Better things? Perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Have you not found them?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet; but then, I can\\'t judge anything except tobacco, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\nFor a long pause she looked down into his upturned face.\\n\\n\"After all, it isn\\'t the way we live nor the work we do that\\nmatters,\" she said slowly, \"but the ideal we put into it. Is\\nthere any work too sordid, too prosaic, to yield a return of\\nbeauty?\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\" he asked, and glanced down the hill to his\\nploughshare lying in the ripped-up field. \"But it is not beauty\\nthat some of us want, you see--it\\'s success, action, happiness,\\ncall it what you will.\"\\n\\n\"Surely they are not the same. I have known many successful\\npeople, and the only three perfectly happy ones I ever met were\\nwhat the world calls failures.\"\\n\\n\"Failures?\" he echoed, and remembered Tucker.\\n\\nHer face softened, and she looked beyond him to the blue sky,\\nshining through the interlacing branches of bared trees.\\n\\n\"Two were women,\" she pursued, clasping and unclasping the quiet\\nhands in her lap, \"and one was a Catholic priest who had been\\nreared in a foundling asylum and educated by charity. When I knew\\nhim he was on his way to a leper island in the South Seas, where\\nhe would be buried alive for the remainder of his life. All he\\nhad was an ideal, but it flooded his soul with light. Another was\\na Russian Nihilist, a girl in years and yet an atheist and a\\nrevolutionist in thought, and her unbelief was in its way as\\nbeautiful as the religion of my priest. To return to Russia meant\\ndeath; she knew, and yet she went back, devoted and exalted, to\\nlay down her life for an illusion. So it seems, when one looks\\nabout the world, that faith and doubt are dry and inanimate forms\\nuntil we pour forth our heart\\'s blood, which vivifies them.\"\\n\\nShe fell silent, and he started and touched softly the hem of her\\nblack skirt.\\n\\n\"And the other?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"The other had a stranger and a longer story, but if you will\\nlisten I\\'ll tell it to you. She was an Italian, of a very old and\\nproud family, and as she possessed rare loveliness and charm, a\\nmarriage was arranged for her with a wealthy nobleman, who had\\nfallen in love with her before she left her convent. She was a\\nrebellious soul, it seems, for the day before her wedding, just\\nafter she had patiently tried on her veil and orange blossoms,\\nshe slipped into the dress of her waiting-maid and ran off with a\\nmusic-teacher--a beggarly fanatic, they told me--a man of red\\nrepublican views, who put dangerous ideas into the heads of the\\npeasantry. From that moment, they said, her life was over; her\\nfamily shut their doors upon her, and she fell finally so low as\\nto be seen one evening singing in the public streets. Her story\\ntouched me when I heard it: it seemed a pitiable thing that a\\nwoman should be wrecked so hopelessly by a single moment of\\nmistaken courage; and after months of searching I at last found\\nthe place she lived in, and went one May evening up the long\\nwinding staircase to her apartment--two clean, plain rooms which\\nlooked on a little balcony where there were pots of sweet basil\\nand many pigeons. At my knock the door opened, and I knew her at\\nonce in the beautiful white face and hands of the woman who stood\\na little back in the shadow. Her forty years had not coarsened\\nher as they do most Italian women, and her eyes still held the\\nunshaken confidence of extreme youth. Her husband was sleeping in\\nthe next room, she said; he had but a few days more to live, and\\nhe had been steadily dying for a year. Then, at my gesture of\\nsympathy, she shook her head and smiled.\\n\\n\"I have had twenty years,\" she said, \"and I have been perfectly\\nhappy. Think of that when so many women die without having even a\\nsingle day of life. Why, but for the one instant of courage that\\nsaved me, I myself might have known the world only as a vegetable\\nknows the garden in which it fattens. My soul has lived, and\\nthough I have been hungry and cold and poorly clad, I have never\\nsunk to the level of what they would have made me. He is a\\ndreamer,\" she finished gently, \"and though his dreams were\\nnourished upon air, and never came true except in our thoughts,\\nstill they have touched even the most common things with beauty.\"\\nWhile she talked, he awoke and called her, and we went in to see\\nhim. He complained a little fretfully that his feet were cold,\\nand she knelt down and warmed them in the shawl upon her bosom.\\nThe mark of death was on him, and I doubt if even in the fulness\\nof his strength he were worthy of the passion he inspired--but\\nthat, after all, makes little difference. It was a great love,\\nwhich is the next best thing to a great faith.\"\\n\\nAs she ended, he raised his eyes slowly, catching the fervour of\\nher glance.\\n\\n\"It was more than that--it was a great deliverance,\" he said.\\n\\nThen, as she rose, he followed her from the graveyard, and they\\ndescended the low brown hill together.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. The Growing Light\\n\\nBy the end of the week a long rain had set in, and while it\\nlasted Christopher took down the tobacco hanging in the roof of\\nthe log barn and laid it in smooth piles, pressed down by boards\\non the ground. The tobacco was still soft from the moist season\\nwhen Jim Weatherby, who had sold his earlier in the year, came\\nover to help pack the large casks for market, bringing at the\\nsame time a piece of news concerning Bill Fletcher.\\n\\n\"It seems Will met the old man somewhere on the road and they\\ncame to downright blows,\" he said. \"Fletcher broke a hickory\\nstick over the boy\\'s shoulders.\"\\n\\nChristopher carefully sorted a pile of plants, and then,\\nselecting the finest six leaves, wrapped them together by means\\nof a smaller one which he twisted tightly about the stems.\\n\\n\"Ah, is that so?\" he returned, with a troubled look.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pretty kettle of fish, sure enough,\" pursued Jim. \"Of\\ncourse, Will has made a fool of himself, and gone to the dogs and\\nall that, but I must say it does seem a shame, when you think\\nthat old Fletcher can\\'t take his money with him to the next\\nworld. As for pure stinginess, I don\\'t believe he\\'d find his\\nmatch if he scoured the country. Why, they say his granddaughter\\nbarely gets enough to eat. Look here! What are you putting in\\nthat bad leaf for. It\\'s worm-eaten all over.\"\\n\\n\"So it is,\" admitted Christopher, examining it with a laugh. \"My\\neyesight must be failing me. But what good under heaven does his\\nmoney do Fletcher, after all?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s saving it up to leave to foreign missions, Tom Spade\\nsays. Mr. Carraway is coming down next week to draw up a new\\nwill.\"\\n\\n\"And his grandchildren come in for nothing?\"\\n\\n\"It looks that way--but you can\\'t see through Bill Fletcher, so\\nnobody knows. The funny part is that he has taken rather a liking\\nto Mrs. Wyndham, I hear, and she has even persuaded him to raise\\nthe wages of his hands. It\\'s a pity she can\\'t patch up a peace\\nwith Will--the quarrel seems to distress her very much.\"\\n\\n\"You have seen her, then?\"\\n\\n\"Yesterday, for a minute. She stopped me near the store and asked\\nfor news of Will. There was nothing I could tell her except that\\nthey dragged along somehow with Sol Peterkin\\'s help. That\\'s a\\nfine woman, Fletcher or no Fletcher.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she can\\'t help that--it\\'s merely a question of name.\\nThere\\'s Cynthia calling us to dinner. We\\'ll have to fill the\\nhogsheads later on.\"\\n\\nBut when the meal was over and he was returning to his work,\\nCynthia followed him with a message from his mother.\\n\\n\"She has asked for you all the morning, Christopher; there\\'s\\nsomething on her mind, though she seems quite herself and in a\\nvery lively humour. It is impossible to get her away from the\\nsubject of marriage--she harps on it continually.\"\\n\\nHe had turned to enter the house at her first words, but now his\\nface clouded, and he hung back before the door.\\n\\n\"Do you think I\\'d better go in?\" he asked, hesitating.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no getting out of it without making her feel neglected,\\nand perhaps your visit may divert her thoughts. I\\'m sure I don\\'t\\nsee what she has left to say on the subject.\"\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll go,\" he said cheerfully; \"but for heaven\\'s sake,\\nhelp me drum up some fresh topics.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blake was sitting up in bed, sipping a glass of port wine,\\nand at Christopher\\'s step she turned her groping gaze helplessly\\nin his direction.\\n\\n\"What a heavy tramp you have, my son; you must be almost as large\\nas your father.\"\\n\\nCrossing the room as lightly as his rude boots permitted,\\nChristopher stooped to kiss the cheek she held toward him. The\\nold lady had wasted gradually to the shadow of herself, and the\\nfirelight from the hearth shone through the unearthly pallor of\\nher face and hands. Her beautiful white hair was still arranged,\\nover a high cushion, in an elaborate fashion, and her gown of\\nfine embroidered linen was pinned together with a delicate cameo\\nbrooch.\\n\\n\"I have been talking very seriously to Lila,\" she began at once,\\nas he sat down by the bedside. \"My age is great, you know, and it\\nis hardly probable that the good Lord will see fit to leave me\\nmuch longer to enjoy the pleasures of this world. Now, what\\ntroubles me more than all else is that I am to die feeling that\\nthe family will pass utterly away. Is it possible that both Lila\\nand yourself persist in your absurd and selfish determination to\\nremain unmarried?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, mother! mother!\" groaned Lila from the fireplace.\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t interrupt me, Lila; you know quite well that a\\nfamily is looked at askance when all of its members remain\\nsingle. Surely one old maid--and I am quite reconciled to poor\\nCynthia\\'s spinsterhood--is enough to leaven things, as your\\nfather used to say--\"\\n\\nHer memory slipped from her for a moment; she caught at it\\npainfully, and a peevish expression crossed her face.\\n\\n\"What was I saying, Lila? I grow so forgetful.\"\\n\\n\"About father, dear.\"\\n\\n\"No, no; I remember now--it was about your marrying. Well, well,\\nas I said before, I fear your attitude is the result of some\\nsentimental fancies you have found in books. My child, there was\\nnever a book yet that held a sensible view of love, and I hope\\nyou will pay no attention to what they say. As for waiting until\\nyou can\\'t live without a man before you marry him--tut-tut! the\\nonly necessary question is to ascertain if you can possibly live\\nwith him. There is a great deal of sentiment talked in life, my\\ndear, and very little lived--and my experience of the world has\\nshown me that one man is likely to make quite as good a husband\\nas another--provided he remains a gentleman and you don\\'t expect\\nhim to become a saint. I\\'ve had a long marriage, my children, and\\na happy one. Your father fell in love with me at his first\\nglance, and he did not hate me at his last, though the period\\ncovered an association of thirty years. We were an ideal couple,\\nall things considered, and he was a very devoted husband; but to\\nthis day I have not ceased to be thankful that he was never\\nplaced in the position where he had to choose between me and his\\ndinner. Honestly, I may as well confess among us three, it makes\\nme nervous when I think of the result of such a pass.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, mother,\" protested Lila reproachfully; \"if I listened to you\\nI should never want to marry any man.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t see why, my dear. I have always urged it as a\\nduty, not advised it as a pleasure. As far as that goes, I hold\\nto this day the highest opinion of matrimony and of men, though I\\nadmit, when I consider the attention they require, I sometimes\\nfeel that women might select a better object. When the last word\\nis said, a man is not half so satisfactory a domestic pet as a\\ncat, and far less neat in his habits. Your poor father would\\nthrow his cigar ashes on the floor to the day of his death, and I\\ncould never persuade him to use an ash-tray, though I gave him\\none regularly every Christmas that he lived. Do you smoke cigars,\\nChristopher? I detect a strong odour of tobacco about you, and I\\nhope you haven\\'t let Tucker persuade you into using anything so\\nvulgar as a pipe. The worst effect of a war, I am inclined to\\nbelieve, is the excuse it offers every man who fought in it to\\nfall into bad habits.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s Uncle Tucker\\'s pipe you smell,\" replied Christopher,\\nwith a laugh, as he rose from his chair. \"I detest the stuff and\\nalways did.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose I ought to be thankful for it,\" said Mrs. Blake,\\ndetaining him by a gesture, \"but I can\\'t help recalling a speech\\nof Micajah Blair\\'s, who said that a woman who didn\\'t flirt and a\\nman who didn\\'t smoke were unsexed creatures. It is a commendable\\neccentricity, I suppose, but an eccentricity, good or bad, is\\nequally to be deplored. Your grandfather always said that the man\\nwho was better than his neighbours was quite as unfortunate as\\nthe man who was worse. Who knows but that your dislike of tobacco\\nand your aversion to marriage may result from the same peculiar\\nquirk in your brain?\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s there and I can\\'t alter it, even to please you,\\nmother,\" declared Christopher from the door. \"I\\'ve set my face\\nsquare against them both, and there it stands.\"\\n\\nHe went out laughing, and Mrs. Blake resigned herself with a sigh\\nto her old port.\\n\\nThe rain fell heavily, whipping up foaming puddles in the muddy\\nroad and beating down the old rosebushes in the yard.\\n\\nAs Christopher paused for a moment in the doorway before going to\\nthe barn he drew with delight the taste of the dampness into his\\nmouth and the odour of the moist earth into his nostrils. The\\nworld had taken on a new and appealing beauty, and yet the\\ncolourless landscape was touched with a sadness which he had\\nnever seen in external things until to-day.\\n\\nHis ears were now opened suddenly, his eyes unbandaged, and he\\nheard the rhythmical fall of the rain and saw the charm of the\\nbrown fields with a vividness that he had never found in his\\nenjoyment of a summer\\'s day. Human life also moved him to\\nresponsive sympathy, and he felt a great aching tenderness for\\nhis blind mother and for his sisters, with their narrowed and\\nempty lives. His own share in the world, he realised, was but\\nthat of a small, insignificant failure; he had been crushed down\\nlike a weed in his tobacco field, and for a new springing-up he\\nfound neither place nor purpose. The facts of his own life were\\nnot altered by so much as a shadow, yet on the outside life that\\nwas not his own he beheld a wonderful illumination.\\n\\nHis powerful figure filled the doorway, and Cynthia, coming up\\nbehind him, raised herself on tiptoe to touch his bared head.\\n\\n\"Your hair is quite wet, Christopher; be sure to put on your hat\\nand fasten the oilcloth over your shoulders when you go back to\\nthe barn. You are so reckless that you make me uneasy. Why, the\\nrain has soaked entirely through your shirt.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m a pine knot; you needn\\'t worry.\"\\n\\nShe sighed impatiently and went back to the kitchen, while his\\ngaze travelled slowly along the wet gray road to the abandoned\\nice-pond, and he thought of his meeting with Maria in the\\ndarkness and of the light of the lantern shining on her face. He\\nremembered her white hands against her black dress, her fervent\\neyes under the grave pallor of her brow, her passionate, kind\\nvoice, and her mouth with the faint smile which seemed never to\\nfade utterly away. Love, which is revealed usually as a pleasant\\ndisturbing sentiment resulting from the ordinary purposes of\\nlife, had come to him in the form of a great regenerating force,\\ndestroying but that it might rebuild anew.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. In Which Carraway Speaks the Truth to Maria\\n\\nDuring the first week in April Carraway appeared at the Hall in\\nanswer to an urgent request from Fletcher that he should, without\\ndelay, put the new will into proper form.\\n\\nOn the morning after his arrival, Carraway had a long\\nconversation with the old man in his sitting-room, and when it\\nwas over he came out with an anxious frown upon his brow and went\\nupstairs to the library which Maria had fitted up in the spare\\nroom next her chamber. It was the pleasantest spot in the house,\\nhe had concluded last evening, and the impression returned to him\\nas he entered now and saw the light from the wood fire falling on\\nthe shining floor, which reflected the stately old furniture, and\\nthe cushions, and the window curtains of faded green. Books were\\neverywhere, and he noticed at once that they were not the kind\\nread by the women whom he knew--big leather volumes on\\nphilosophy, yellow-covered French novels, and curled edges of\\nwhat he took to be the classic poets. It was almost with relief\\nthat he noticed a dainty feminine touch here and there--a work-\\nbag of flowered silk upon the sofa, a bowl of crocuses among the\\npapers on the old mahogany desk, and clinging to each bit of\\nwell-worn drapery in the room a faint and delicate fragrance.\\n\\nMaria was lying drowsily in a low chair before the fire, and as\\nhe entered she looked up with a smile and motioned to a\\ncomfortable seat across the hearth. A book was on her knees, but\\nshe had not been reading, for her fingers were playing carelessly\\nwith the uncut leaves. Against her soft black dress the whiteness\\nof her face and hands showed almost too intense a contrast, and\\nyet there was no hint of fragility in her appearance. From head\\nto foot she was abounding with energy, throbbing with life, and\\nthough Carraway would still, perhaps, have hesitated to call her\\nbeautiful, his eyes dwelt with pleasure on the noble lines of her\\nrelaxed figure. Better than beauty, he admitted the moment\\nafterward, was the charm that shone for him in her wonderfully\\nexpressive face--a face over which the experiences of many lives\\nseemed to ripple faintly in what was hardly more than the shadow\\nof a smile. She had loved and suffered, he thought, with his gaze\\nupon her, and from both love and suffering she had gained that\\nfulness of nature which is the greatest good that either has to\\nyield.\\n\\n\"So it is serious,\" she said anxiously, as he sat down.\\n\\n\"I fear so--at least, where your brother is concerned. I can\\'t\\nsay just what the terms of the will are, of course, but he made\\nno secret at breakfast of his determination to leave half of his\\nproperty--which the result of recent investments has made very\\nlarge--to the cause of foreign missions.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, he has told me about it.\"\\n\\n\"Then there\\'s nothing more to be said, unless you can persuade\\nhim for your brother\\'s sake to destroy the will when his anger\\nhas blown over. I used every argument I could think of, but he\\nsimply wouldn\\'t listen to me--swept my advice aside as if it was\\nso much wasted breath--\"\\n\\nHe paused as Maria bent her ear attentively.\\n\\n\"He is coming upstairs now!\" she exclaimed, amazed.\\n\\nThere was a heavy tread on the staircase, and a little later\\nFletcher came in and turned to close the door carefully behind\\nhim. He had recovered for a moment his air of bluff good-humour,\\nand his face crinkled into a ruddy smile.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re hatching schemes between you, I reckon,\" he observed,\\nand, crossing to the hearth, pushed back a log with the toe of\\nhis heavy boot.\\n\\n\"It looks that way, certainly,\" replied Carraway, with his\\npleasant laugh. \"But I must confess that I was doing nothing more\\ninteresting than admiring Mrs. Wyndham\\'s taste in books.\"\\n\\nFletcher glanced round indifferently.\\n\\n\"Well, I haven\\'t any secrets,\" he pursued, still under the\\npressure of the thought which had urged him upstairs, \"and as far\\nas that goes, I can tear up that piece of paper and have it done\\nwith any day I please.\"\\n\\n\"So I had the honour to advise,\" remarked Carraway.\\n\\n\"That\\'s neither here nor thar, I reckon--it\\'s made now, and so\\nit\\'s likely to stand until I die, though I don\\'t doubt you\\'ll\\ntwist and split it then as much as you can. However, I reckon the\\nforeign missions will look arter the part that goes to them, and\\nif Maria\\'s got the sense I credit her with she\\'ll look arter\\nhers.\"\\n\\n\"After mine?\" exclaimed Maria, lifting her head to return his\\ngaze. \"Why, I thought you gave me my share when I married.\"\\n\\n\"So I did--so I did, and you let it slip like water through your\\nfingers; but you\\'ve grown up, I reckon, sence you were such a\\nfool as to have your head turned by Wyndham, and if you don\\'t\\nhold on to this tighter than you did to the last you deserve to\\nlose it, that\\'s all. You\\'re a good woman--I ain\\'t lived a month\\nin the house with you and not found that out--but if you hadn\\'t\\nhad something more than goodness inside your head you wouldn\\'t\\nhave got so much as a cent out of me again. Saidie\\'s a good woman\\nand a blamed fool, too, but you\\'re different; you\\'ve got a\\nbackbone in your body, and I\\'ll be hanged if that ain\\'t why I\\'m\\nleaving the Hall to you.\"\\n\\n\"The Hall?\" echoed Maria, rising impulsively from her chair and\\nfacing him upon the hearthrug.\\n\\n\"The Hall and Saidie and the whole lot,\" returned Fletcher,\\nchuckling, \"and I may as well tell you now, that, for all your\\nspendthrift notions about wages, you\\'re the only woman I ever saw\\nwho was fit to own a foot of land. But I like the quiet way you\\nmanage things, somehow, and, bless my soul, if you were a man I\\'d\\nleave you the whole business and let the missions hang.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s time yet,\" observed Carraway beneath his breath.\\n\\n\"No, no; it\\'s settled now,\" returned Fletcher, \"and she\\'ll have\\nmore than she can handle as it is. Most likely she\\'ll marry\\nagain, being a woman, and a man will be master here, arter all.\\nIf you do,\" he added, turning angrily upon his granddaughter,\\n\"for heaven\\'s sakes, don\\'t let it be another precious scamp like\\nyour first!\"\\n\\nWith a shiver Maria caught her breath and bent toward him with an\\nappealing gesture of her arms.\\n\\n\"But you must not do it, grandfather; it isn\\'t right. The place\\nwas never meant to belong to me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it belongs to me, I reckon, and confound your silly\\npuritanical fancies, I\\'ll leave it where I please,\" retorted\\nFletcher, and strode from the room.\\n\\nThrowing herself back into her chair, Maria lay for a time\\nlooking thoughtfully at the hickory log, which crumbled and threw\\nout a shower of red sparks. Her face was grave, but there was no\\nhint of indecision upon it, and it struck Carraway very forcibly\\nat the instant that she knew her own mind quite clearly and\\ndistinctly upon this as upon most other matters.\\n\\n\"It may surprise you,\" she said presently, speaking with sudden\\npassion, \"but by right the Hall ought not to be mine, and I do\\nnot want it. I have never loved it because it has never for a\\nmoment seemed home to me, and our people have always appeared\\nstrangers upon the land. How we came here I do not know, but it\\nhas not suited us, and we have only disfigured a beauty into\\nwhich we did not fit. Its very age is a reproach to us, for it\\nshows off our newness--our lack of any past that we may call our\\nown. Will might feel himself master here, but I cannot.\"\\n\\nCarraway took off his glasses and rubbed patiently at the ridge\\nthey had drawn across his nose.\\n\\n\"And yet, why not?\" he asked. \"The place has been in your\\ngrandfather\\'s possession now for more than twenty years.\"\\n\\n\"For more than twenty years,\" repeated Maria scornfully, \"and\\nbefore that the Blakes lived here--how long?\"\\n\\nHe met her question squarely. \"For more than two hundred.\"\\n\\nWithout shifting her steady gaze which she turned upon his face,\\nshe leaned forward, clasping her hands loosely upon the knees.\\n\\n\"There are things that I want to know, Mr. Carraway,\" she said,\\n\"many things, and I believe that you can tell me. Most of all, I\\nwant to know why we ever came to Blake Hall? Why the Blakes ever\\nleft it? And, above all, why they have hated us so heartily and\\nso long?\"\\n\\nShe paused and sat motionless, while she hung with suspended\\nbreath upon his reply.\\n\\nFor a moment the lawyer hesitated, nervously twirling his glasses\\nbetween his thumb and forefinger; then he slowly shook his head\\nand looked from her to the fire.\\n\\n\"Twenty years are not as a day, despite your scorn, my dear young\\nlady, and many facts become overlaid with fiction in a shorter\\ntime.\"\\n\\n\"But you know something--and you believe still more.\"\\n\\n\"God forbid that I should convert you to any belief of mine.\"\\n\\nShe put out a protesting hand, her eyes still gravely insistent.\\n\"Tell me all--I demand it. It is my right; you must see that.\"\\n\\n\"A right to demolish sand houses--to scatter old dust.\"\\n\\n\"A right to hear the truth. Surely you will not withhold it from\\nme?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know the truth, so I can\\'t enlighten you. I know only\\nthe stories of both sides, and they resemble each other merely in\\nthat they both center about the same point of interest.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will tell them to me--you must,\" she said earnestly.\\n\"Tell me first, word for word, all that the Blakes believe of\\nus.\"\\n\\nWith a laugh, he put on his glasses that he might bring her\\ntroubled face the more clearly before him.\\n\\n\"A high spirit of impartiality, I admit,\" he observed.\\n\\n\"That I should want to hear the other side?\"\\n\\n\"That, being a woman, you should take for granted the existence\\nof the other side.\"\\n\\nShe shook her head impatiently. \"You can\\'t evade me by airing\\ncamphor-scented views of my sex,\" she returned. \"What I wish to\\nknow--and I still stick to my point, you see--is the very thing\\nyou are so carefully holding back.\"\\n\\n\"I am holding back nothing, on my honour,\" he assured her. \"If\\nyou want the impression which still exists in the county--only an\\nimpression--I must make plain to you at the start (for the events\\nhappened when the State was in the throes of reconstruction, when\\neach man was busy rebuilding his own fortunes, and when tragedies\\noccurred without notice and were hushed up without remark)--if\\nyou want merely an impression, I repeat, then you may have it, my\\ndear lady, straight from the shoulder.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" her voice rose inquiringly, for he had paused.\\n\\n\"There is really nothing definite known of the affair,\" he\\nresumed after a moment, \"even the papers which would have thrown\\nlight into the darkness were destroyed--burned, it is said, in an\\nold office which the Federal soldiers fired. It is all mystery--\\ngrim mystery and surmise; and when there is no chance of either\\nproving or disproving a case I dare say one man\\'s word answers\\nquite as well as another\\'s. At all events, we have your\\ngrandfather\\'s testimony as chief actor and eye-witness against\\nthe inherited convictions of our somewhat Homeric young\\nneighbour. For eighteen years before the war Mr. Fletcher was\\nsole agent--a queer selection, certainly--for old Mr. Blake, who\\nwas known to have grown very careless in the confidence he\\nplaced. When the crash came, about three years after the war, the\\nold gentleman\\'s mind was much enfeebled, and it was generally\\nrumoured that his children were kept in ignorance that the place\\nwas passing from them until it was auctioned off over their heads\\nand Mr. Fletcher became the purchaser. How this was, of course, I\\ndo not pretend to say, but when the Hall finally went for the\\nabsurd sum of seven thousand dollars life was at best a hard\\nstruggle in the State, and I imagine there was less surprise at\\nthe sacrifice of the place than at the fact that your grandfather\\nshould have been able to put down the ready money. The making of\\na fortune is always, I suppose, more inexplicable than the losing\\nof one. The Blakes had always been accounted people of great\\nwealth and wastefulness, but within five years from the close of\\nthe war they had sunk to the position in which you find them now\\n--a change, I dare say, from which it is natural much lingering\\nbitterness should result. The old man died almost penniless, and\\nhis children were left to struggle on from day to day as best\\nthey could. It is a sad tale, and I do not wonder that it moves\\nyou,\" he finished slowly, and looked down to wipe his glasses.\\n\\n\"And grandfather?\" asked the girl quietly. Her gaze had not\\nwavered from his face, but her eyes shone luminous through the\\ntears which filled them.\\n\\n\"He became rich as suddenly as the Blakes became poor. Where his\\nmoney came from no one asked, and no one cared except the Blakes,\\nwho were helpless. They made some small attempts at law suits, I\\nbelieve, but Christopher was only a child then, and there was\\nnobody with the spirit to push the case. Then money was needed,\\nand they were quite impoverished.\"\\n\\nMaria threw out her hands with a gesture of revolt.\\n\\n\"Oh, it is a terrible story,\" she said, \"a terrible story.\"\\n\\n\"It is an old one, and belongs to terrible times. You have drawn\\nit from me for your own purpose, and be that as it may, I have\\nalways believed in giving a straight answer to a straight\\nquestion. Now such things would be impossible,\" he added\\ncheerfully; \"then, I fear, they were but too probable.\"\\n\\n\"In your heart you believe that it is true?\" He did not flinch\\nfrom his response. \"In my heart I believe that there is more in\\nit than a lie.\"\\n\\nRising from her chair, she turned from him and walked rapidly up\\nand down the room, through the firelight which shimmered over the\\npolished floor. Once she stopped by the window, and, drawing the\\ncurtains aside, looked out upon the April sunshine and upon the\\nyoung green leaves which tinted the distant woods. Then coming\\nback to the hearthrug, she stood gazing down upon him with a\\nserene and resolute expression.\\n\\n\"I am glad now that the Hall will be mine,\" she said, \"glad even\\nthat it wasn\\'t left to Will, for who knows how he would have\\nlooked at it. There is but one thing to be done: you must see\\nthat yourself. At grandfather\\'s death the place must go back to\\nits rightful owners.\"\\n\\n\"To its rightful owners!\" he repeated in amazement, and rose to\\nhis feet.\\n\\n\"To the Blakes. Oh, don\\'t you see it--can\\'t you see that there is\\nnothing else to do in common honesty?\"\\n\\nHe shook his head, smiling.\\n\\n\"It is very beautiful, my child, but is it reasonable, after\\nall?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Reasonable?\" The fine scorn he had heard before in her voice\\nthrilled her from head to foot. \"Shall I stop to ask what is\\nreasonable before doing what is right?\"\\n\\nWithout looking at her, he drew a handkerchief from his pocket\\nand shook it slowly out from its folds.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not sure that you shouldn\\'t,\" he rejoined.\\n\\n\"Then I shan\\'t be reasonable. I\\'ll be wise,\" she said; \"for\\nsurely, if there is any wisdom upon earth, it is simply to do\\nright. It may be many years off, and I may be an old woman, but\\nwhen the Hall comes to me at grandfather\\'s death I shall return\\nit to the Blakes.\"\\n\\nIn the silence which followed he found himself looking into her\\nardent face with a wonder not unmixed with awe. To his rather\\ncynical view of the Fletchers such an outburst came as little\\nless than a veritable thunderclap, and for the first time in his\\nlife he felt a need to modify his conservative theories as to the\\nnecessity of blue blood to nourish high ideals. Maria, indeed,\\nseemed to him as she stood there, drawn fine and strong against\\nthe curtains of faded green, to hold about her something better\\nthan that aroma of the past which he had felt to be the intimate\\ncharm of all exquisite things, and it was at the moment the very\\nlight and promise of the future which he saw in the broad\\nintelligence of her brow. Was it possible, after all, he\\nquestioned, that out of the tragic wreck of old claims and old\\ncustoms which he had witnessed there should spring creatures of\\neven finer fiber than those who had gone before?\\n\\n\"So this is your last word?\" he inquired helplessly.\\n\\n\"My last word to you--yes. In a moment I am going out to see the\\nBlakes--to make them understand.\"\\n\\nHe put out his hand as if to detain her by a feeble pull at her\\nskirt. \"At least, you will sleep a night upon your resolution?\"\\n\\n\"How can my sleeping alter things? My waking may.\"\\n\\n\"And you will sweep the claims of twenty years aside in an hour?\"\\n\\n\"They are swept aside by the claims of two hundred.\"\\n\\nWith a courteous gesture he bent over her hand and raised it\\ngravely to his lips.\\n\\n\"My dear young friend, you are very lovely and very\\nunreasonable,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII . Between Maria and Christopher\\n\\nA little later, Maria, with a white scarf thrown over her head,\\ncame out of the Hall and passed swiftly along the road under the\\nyoung green leaves which were putting out on the trees. When she\\nreached the whitewashed gate before the Blake cottage she saw\\nChristopher ploughing in the field on the left of the house, and\\nturning into the little path which trailed through the tall weeds\\nbeside the \"worm\" fence, she crossed the yard and stood\\nhesitating at the beginning of the open furrow he had left behind\\nhim. His gaze was bent upon the horses, and for a moment she\\nwatched him in attentive silence, her eyes dwelling on his\\nmassive figure, which cast a gigantic blue-black shadow across\\nthe April sunbeams. She saw him at the instant with a\\ndistinctness, a clearness of perception, that she had never been\\nconscious of until to-day, as if each trivial detail in his\\nappearance was magnified by the pale yellow sunshine through\\nwhich she looked upon it. The abundant wheaten-brown hair, waving\\nfrom the moist circle drawn by the hat he had thrown aside, the\\nstrong masculine profile burned to a faint terracotta shade from\\nwind and sun, and the powerful hands knotted and roughened by\\nheavy labour, all stood out vividly in the mental image which\\nremained with her when she lowered her eyes.\\n\\nAroused by a sound from the house, he looked up and saw her\\nstanding on the edge of the ploughed field, her lace scarf blown\\nsoftly in the April wind. After a single minute of breathless\\nsurprise he tossed the long ropes on the ground, and, leaving the\\nplough, came rapidly across the loose clods of upturned earth.\\n\\n\"Did you come because I was thinking of you?\" he asked simply,\\nwith the natural directness which had appealed so strongly to her\\nfearless nature.\\n\\n\"Were you thinking of me?\" her faint smile shone on him for an\\ninstant; \"and were your thoughts as grave, I wonder, as my reason\\nfor coming?\"\\n\\n\"So you have a reason, then?\"\\n\\n\"Did you think I should dare to come without one?\"\\n\\nThe light wind caught her scarf, blowing the long ends about her\\nhead. From the frame of soft white lace her eyes looked dark and\\nsolemn and very distant.\\n\\n\"I had hoped that you had no other reason than kindness.\" He had\\nlost entirely the rustic restraint he had once felt in her\\npresence, and, as he stood there in his clothes of dull blue\\njean, it was easy to believe in the gallant generations at his\\nback. Was the fret of their gay adventures in his blood? she\\nwondered.\\n\\n\"You will see the kindness in my reason, I hope,\" she answered\\nquietly, while the glow of her sudden resolution illumined her\\nface, \"and at least you will admit the justice--though belated.\"\\n\\nHe drew a step nearer. \"And it concerns you--and me?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"It concerns you--oh, yes, yes, and me also, though very\\nslightly. I have just learned--just a moment ago--what you must\\nhave thought I knew all along.\"\\n\\nAs he fell back she saw that he paled slowly beneath his sunburn.\\n\\n\"You have just learned--what?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\"The truth,\" she replied; \"as much of the truth as one may learn\\nin an hour: how it came that you are here and I am there--at the\\nHall.\"\\n\\n\"At the Hall?\" he repeated, and there was relief in the quick\\nbreath he drew; \"I had forgotten the Hall.\"\\n\\n\"Forgotten it? Why, I thought it was your dream, your longing,\\nyour one great memory.\"\\n\\nSmiling into her eyes, he shook his head twice before he\\nanswered.\\n\\n\"It was all that--once.\"\\n\\n\"Then it is not so now?\" she asked, disappointed, \"and what I\\nhave to tell you will lose half its value.\"\\n\\n\"So it is about the Hall?\"\\n\\nWith one hand she held back the fluttering lace upon her bosom,\\nwhile lifting the other she pointed across the ploughed fields to\\nthe old gray chimneys huddled amid the budding oaks.\\n\\n\"Does it not make you homesick to stand here and look at it?\" she\\nasked. \"Think! For more than two hundred years your people lived\\nthere, and there is not a room within the house, nor a spot upon\\nthe land, that does not hold some sacred association for those of\\nyour name.\" Startled by the passion in her words, he turned from\\nthe Hall at which he had been gazing.\\n\\n\"What do you mean? \" he demanded imperatively. \"What do you wish\\nto say?\"\\n\\n\"Look at the Hall and not at me while I tell you. It is this--now\\nlisten and do not turn from it for an instant. Blake Hall--I have\\njust found it out--will come to me at grandfather\\'s death, and\\nwhen it does--when it does I shall return it to your family--the\\nwhole of it, every lovely acre. Oh, don\\'t look at me--look at the\\nHall!\"\\n\\nBut he looked neither at her nor at the Hall, for his gaze\\ndropped to the ground and hung blankly upon a clod of dry brown\\nearth. She saw him grow pale to the lips and dark blue circles\\ncome out slowly about his eyes.\\n\\n\"It is but common justice; you see that,\" she urged.\\n\\nAt this he raised his head and returned her look.\\n\\n\"And what of Will?\" he asked.\\n\\nHer surprise showed in her face, and at sight of it he repeated\\nhis question with a stubborn insistence: \"But what of Will? What\\nhas been done for Will?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know; I don\\'t know. The break is past mending. But\\nit is not of him that I must speak to you now--it is of yourself.\\nDon\\'t you see that the terrible injustice has bowed me to the\\nearth? What am I better than a dependent--a charity ward who has\\nlived for years upon your money? My very education, my little\\nculture, the refinements you see in me--these even I have no real\\nright to, for they belong to your family. While you have worked\\nas a labourer in the field I have been busy squandering the\\nwealth which was not mine.\"\\n\\nHis face grew gentle as he looked at her.\\n\\n\"If the Blake money has made you what you are, then it has not\\nbeen utterly wasted,\" he replied.\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t understand--you don\\'t understand,\" she repeated,\\npressing her hands upon her bosom, as if to quiet her fluttering\\nbreath. \"You have suffered from it all along, but it is I who\\nsuffer most to-day--who suffer most because I am upon the side of\\nthe injustice. I can have no peace until you tell me that I may\\nstill do my poor best to make amends--that when your home is mine\\nyou will let me give it back to you.\"\\n\\n\"It is too late,\" he answered with bitter humour. \"You can\\'t put\\na field-hand in a fine house and make him a gentleman. It is too\\nlate to undo what was done twenty years ago. The place can never\\nbe mine again--I have even ceased to want it. Give it to Will.\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t if I wanted to,\" she replied; \"but I don\\'t want to--I\\ndon\\'t want to. It must go back to you and to your sisters. Do you\\nthink I could ever be owner of it now? Even if it comes to me\\nwhen I am an old woman, I shall always feel myself a stranger in\\nthe house, though I should live there day and night for fifty\\nyears. No, no; it is impossible that I should ever keep it for an\\ninstant. It must go back to you and to the Blakes who come after\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"There will be no Blakes after me,\" he answered. \"I am the last.\"\\n\\n\"Then promise me that if the Hall is ever mine you will take it.\"\\n\\n\"From you? No: not unless I took it to hand on to your brother.\\nIt is an old score that you have brought up--one that lasted\\ntwenty years before it was settled. It is too late to stir up\\nmatters now.\"\\n\\n\"It is not too late,\" she said earnestly. \"It is never too late\\nto try to undo a wrong.\"\\n\\n\"The wrong was not yours; it must never touch you,\" he replied.\\n\"If my life was as clean as yours, it would, perhaps, not be too\\nlate for me either. Ten years ago I might have felt differently\\nabout it, but not now.\"\\n\\nHe broke off hurriedly, and Maria, with a hopeless gesture,\\nturned back into the path.\\n\\n\"Then I shall appeal to your sisters when the time comes,\" she\\nresponded quietly.\\n\\nCatching the loose ends of her scarf, he drew her slowly around\\nuntil she met his eyes. \"And I have said nothing to you--to you,\"\\nhe began, in a constrained voice, which he tried in vain to\\nsteady, \"because it is so hard to say anything and not say too\\nmuch. This, at least, you must know--that I am your servant now\\nand shall be all my life.\"\\n\\nShe smiled sadly, looking down at the scarf which was crushed in\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\"And yet you will not grant the wish of my heart,\" she said.\\n\\n\"How could I? Put me back in the Hall, and I should be as\\nignorant and as coarse as I am out here. A labourer is all I am\\nand all I am fit to be. I once had a rather bookish ambition, you\\nknow, but that is over--I wanted to read Greek and translate \\'The\\nIliad\\' and all that--and yet to-day I doubt if I could write a\\ndecent letter to save my soul. It\\'s partly my fault, of course,\\nbut you can\\'t know you could never know--the abject bitterness\\nand despair of those years when I tried to sink myself to the\\nlevel of the brutes--tried to forget that I was any better than\\nthe oxen I drove. No, there\\'s no pulling me up again; such things\\naren\\'t lived over, and I\\'m down for good.\"\\n\\nHer tears, which she had held back, broke forth at his words, and\\nhe saw them fall upon her bosom, where her hands were still\\ntightly clasped.\\n\\n\"And it is all our fault,\" she said brokenly.\\n\\n\"Not yours, surely.\"\\n\\n\"It is not too late,\" she went on passionately, laying her hand\\nupon his arm and looking up at him with a misty brightness. \"Oh,\\nif you would let me make amends--let me help you!\"\\n\\n\"Is there any help?\" he asked, with his eyes on the hand upon his\\narm.\\n\\n\"If you will let me, I will find it. We will take up your study\\nwhere you broke it off--we will come up step by step, even to\\nHomer, if you like. I am fond of books, you know, and I have had\\nmy fancy for Greek, too. Oh, it will be so easy--so easy; and\\nwhen the time comes for you to go back to the Hall, I shall have\\nmade you the most learned Blake of the whole line.\"\\n\\nHe bent quickly and kissed the hand which trembled on his sleeve.\\n\\n\"Make of me what you please,\" he said; \"I am at your service.\"\\n\\nFor the second time he saw the wonderful light--the fervour--\\nillumine her face, and then fade slowly, leaving a still, soft\\nradiance of expression.\\n\\n\"Then I may teach you all that you haven\\'t learned,\" she said\\nwith a happy little laugh. \"How fortunate that I should have been\\nborn a bookworm. Shall we begin with Greek?\"\\n\\nHe smiled. \"No; let\\'s start with English--and start low.\"\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll do both; but where shall it be? Not at the Hall.\"\\n\\n\"Hardly. There\\'s a bench, though, down by the poplar spring that\\nlooks as if it were meant to be in school. Do you know the place?\\nIt\\'s in my pasture by the meadow brook?\"\\n\\n\"I can find it, and I\\'ll bring the books to-morrow at this hour.\\nWill you come?\"\\n\\n\"To-morrow--and every day?\"\\n\\n\"Every day.\"\\n\\nFor an instant he looked at her in perplexity. \"I may as well\\ntell you,\" he said at last, \"that I\\'m one of the very biggest\\nrascals on God\\'s earth. I\\'m not worth all this, you know; that\\'s\\nhonest.\"\\n\\n\"And so are you,\" she called back gaily, as she turned from him\\nand went rapidly along the little path.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. Christopher Faces Himself\\n\\nWhen she had gone through the gate and across the little patch of\\ntrodden grass into the sunken road, Christopher took up the ropes\\nand with a quick jerk of the buried ploughshare began his\\nplodding walk over the turned-up sod. The furrow was short, but\\nwhen he reached the end of it he paused from sheer exhaustion and\\nstood wiping the heavy moisture from his brow. The scene through\\nwhich he had just passed had left him quivering in every nerve,\\nas if he had been engaged in some terrible struggle against\\nphysical odds. All at once he became aware that the afternoon was\\ntoo oppressive for field work, and, unhitching the horses from\\nthe plough, he led them slowly back to the stable beyond the\\nhouse. As he went, it seemed to him that he had grown middle-aged\\nwithin the hour; his youth had departed as mysteriously as his\\nstrength.\\n\\nA little later, Tucker, who was sitting on the end of a big log\\nat the woodpile, looked up in surprise from the anthill he was\\nwatching.\\n\\n\"Quit work early, eh, Christopher?\"\\n\\n\"Yes; I\\'ve given out,\" replied Christopher, stopping beside him\\nand picking up the axe which lay in a scattered pile of chips.\\n\"It\\'s the spring weather, I reckon, but I\\'m not fit for a tougher\\njob than chopping wood.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d leave that off just now, if I were you.\"\\n\\nRaising the axe, Christopher swung it lightly over his shoulder;\\nthen, lowering it with a nerveless movement, he tossed it\\nimpatiently on the ground.\\n\\n\"A queer thing happened just now, Uncle Tucker,\" he said, \"a\\nthing you\\'ll hardly believe even when I tell you. I had a visit\\nfrom Mrs. Wyndham, and she came to say--\" he stammered and broke\\noff abruptly.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Wyndham?\" repeated Tucker. \"She\\'s Bill Fletcher\\'s\\ngranddaughter, isn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Maria Fletcher--you may have seen her when she lived here, five\\nor six years ago.\"\\n\\nTucker shook his head.\\n\\n\"Bless your heart, my boy, I haven\\'t seen a woman except Lucy and\\nthe girls for twenty-five years. But why did she come, I wonder?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the strange part, and you won\\'t understand it until you\\nsee her. She came because she had just heard--some one had told\\nher--about Fletcher\\'s old rascality.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t say so!\" exclaimed Tucker beneath his breath. He gave\\na long whistle and sat smiling at the little red anthill. \"And\\ndid she actually proffer an apology?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"An amendment, rather. The Hall will come to her at Fletcher\\'s\\ndeath, and she walked over to say quite coolly that she wanted to\\ngive it back to us. Think of that! To part with such a home for\\nthe sake of mere right and justice.\"\\n\\n\"It is something to think about,\" assented Tucker, \"and to think\\nhard about, too--and yet I cut my teeth on the theory that women\\nhave no sense of honour. Now, that is pure, foolish, strait-laced\\nhonour, and nothing else.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing else,\" repeated Christopher softly; \"and if you\\'ll\\nbelieve it, she cried--she really cried when I told her I\\ncouldn\\'t take it. Oh, she\\'s wonderful!\" he burst out suddenly,\\nall his awkward reserve dropping from him. \"You can\\'t be with her\\nten minutes without feeling how good she is--good all through,\\nwith a big goodness that isn\\'t in the least like the little\\nprudishness of other women--\"\\n\\nHe checked himself hastily, but not before Tucker had glanced up\\nwith his pleasant smile.\\n\\n\"Well, my boy, I don\\'t misunderstand you. I never knew a man yet\\nto begin a love affair with a panegyric on virtue. She\\'s an\\nestimable woman, I dare say, and I presume she\\'s plain.\"\\n\\n\"Plain!\" gasped Christopher. \"Why, she\\'s beautiful--at least, you\\nthink so when you see her smile.\"\\n\\n\"So she smiled through her tears, eh?\"\\n\\nChristopher started angrily. \"Can you sit there on that log and\\nlaugh at such a thing?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" protested Tucker, \"an honest laugh never turned a\\nsweet deed sour since the world began--and that was more than\\nsweet; it was fine. I\\'d like to know that woman, Christopher.\"\\n\\n\"You could never know her--no man could. She\\'s all clear and\\nbright on the surface, but all mystery beneath.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that\\'s it; you see, there was never a fascinating woman yet\\nwho was easy to understand. Wasn\\'t it that shrewd old gallant,\\nBolivar Blake, who said that in love an ounce of mystery was\\nworth a pound of morality?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s like him: he said a lot of nonsense,\" commented\\nChristopher. \"But to think,\" he added after a moment, \"that she\\nshould be Bill Fletcher\\'s granddaughter!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I knew her mother,\" returned Tucker, \"and she was as\\nhonest, God-fearing a body as ever trod this earth. She stood out\\nagainst Fletcher to the last, you know, and worked hard for her\\nliving while that scamp, her husband, drank them both to death.\\nThere are some people who are born with a downright genius for\\nhonesty, and this girl may be one of them.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know--I don\\'t know,\" said Christopher, in a voice which\\nhad grown spiritless. Then after an instant in which he stared\\nblankly down at Tucker\\'s ant-hill, he turned hurriedly away and\\nfollowed the little straggling path to the barn door.\\n\\n>From the restlessness that pricked in his limbs there was no\\nescape, and after entering the barn he came out again and went\\ndown into the pasture to the long bench beside the poplar spring.\\nHere, while the faint shadows of the young leaves played over\\nhim, he sat with his head bent forward and his hands dropped\\nlistlessly between his knees.\\n\\nAround him there was the tender green of the spring meadows,\\ndivided by a little brook where the willows shone pure silver\\nunder the April wind. Near at hand a catbird sang in short,\\ntripping notes, and in the clump of briars by the spring a rabbit\\nsat alert for the first sound. So motionless was Christopher that\\nhe seemed, sitting there by the pale gray body of a poplar,\\nalmost to become a part of the tree against which he leaned--to\\nlose, for the time at least, his share in the moving animal life\\naround him.\\n\\nAt first there was mere blankness in his mind--an absence of\\nlight and colour in which his thoughts were suddenly blotted out;\\nthen, as the wind raised the hair upon his brow, he lifted his\\neyes from the ground, and with the movement it seemed as if his\\nlife ran backward to its beginning and he saw himself not as he\\nwas to-day, but as he might have been in a period of time which\\nhad no being.\\n\\nBefore him were his knotted and blistered hands, his long limbs\\noutstretched in their coarse clothes, but in the vision beyond\\nthe little spring he walked proudly with his rightful heritage\\nupon him--a Blake by force of blood and circumstance. The world\\nlay before him--bright, alluring, a thing of enchanting promise,\\nand it was as if he looked for the first time upon the\\npossibilities contained in this life upon the earth. For an\\ninstant the glow lasted--the beauty dwelt upon the vision, and he\\nbeheld, clear and radiant, the happiness which might have been\\nhis own; then it grew dark again, and he faced the brutal truth\\nin all its nakedness; he knew himself for what he was--a man\\ndebased by ignorance and passion to the level of the beasts. He\\nhad sold his birthright for a requital, which had sickened him\\neven in the moment of fulfilment.\\n\\nTo do him justice, now that the time had come for an\\nacknowledgment he felt no temptation to evade the judgment of his\\nown mind, nor to cheat himself with the belief that the boy was\\nmarked for ruin before he saw him--that Will had worked out, in\\nvicious weakness, his own end. It was not the weakness, after\\nall, that he had played upon--it was rather the excitable passion\\nand the whimpering fears of the hereditary drunkard. He\\nremembered now the long days that he had given to his revenge,\\nthe nights when he had tossed sleepless while he planned a\\nwidening of the breach with Fletcher. That, at least was his\\nwork, and his alone--the bitter hatred, more cruel than death,\\nwith which the two now stood apart and snarled. It was a human\\nlife that he had taken in his hand--he saw that now in his first\\nmoment of awakening--a life that he had destroyed as deliberately\\nas if he had struck it dead before him. Day by day, step by step,\\nsilent, unswerving, devilish, he had kept about his purpose, and\\nnow at the last he had only to sit still and watch his triumph.\\n\\nWith a sob, he bowed his head in his clasped hands, and so shut\\nout the light.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. By the Poplar Spring\\n\\nThe next day he watched for her anxiously until she appeared over\\nthe low brow of the hill, her arms filled with books, and Agag\\ntrotting at her side. As she descended slowly into the broad\\nravine where he awaited her under six great poplars that\\nsurrounded the little spring, he saw that she wore a dress of\\nsome soft, creamy stuff and a large white hat that shaded her\\nbrow and eyes. She looked younger, he noticed, than she had done\\nin her black gown, and he recalled while she neared him the\\nafternoon more than six years before when she had come suddenly\\nupon him while he worked in his tobacco.\\n\\n\"So you are present at the roll-call?\" she said, laughing, as she\\nsat down on the bench beside him and spread out the books that\\nshe had brought.\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ve been sitting here for half an hour,\" he answered.\\n\\n\"What a shame--that\\'s a whole furrow unploughed, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Several of them; but I\\'m not counting furrows now. I\\'m getting\\nready to appall you by my ignorance.\" He spoke with a determined,\\nreckless gaiety that lent a peculiar animation to his face.\\n\\n\"If you are waiting for that, you are going to be disappointed,\"\\nshe replied, smiling, \"for I\\'ve put my heart into the work, and I\\nwas born and patterned for a teacher; I always knew it. We\\'re\\ngoing to do English literature and a first book in Latin.\"\\n\\n\"Are we?\" He picked up the Latin grammar and ran his fingers\\nlightly through the pages. \"I went a little way in this once,\" he\\nsaid. \"I got as far as \\'omnia vincit amor\\' and stopped. Tobacco\\nconquered me instead.\"\\n\\nShe caught up his gay laugh. \"Well, we\\'ll try it over again,\" she\\nreturned, and held out the book.\\n\\nAn hour later, when the first lesson was over and he had gone\\nback to his work, he carried with him a wonderful exhilaration--a\\nfeeling as if he had with a sudden effort burst the bonds that\\nhad held him to the earth. By the next day the elation vanished\\nand a great heaviness came in its place, but for a single\\nafternoon he had known what it was to thrill in every fiber with\\na powerful and pure emotion--an emotion beside which all the\\ncheap sensations of his life showed stale and colourless. While\\nthe strangeness of this mood was still upon him he chanced upon\\nLila and Jim Weatherby standing together by the gate in the gray\\ndusk, and when presently the girl came back alone across the yard\\nhe laid his hand upon her arm and drew her over to Tucker\\'s bench\\nbeside the rose-bush.\\n\\n\"Lila, I\\'ve changed my mind about it all,\" he said.\\n\\n\"About what, dear?\"\\n\\n\"About Jim and you. We were all wrong--all of us except Uncle\\nTucker--wrong from the very start. You musn\\'t mind mother; you\\nmusn\\'t mind anybody. Marry Jim and be happy, if he can make you\\nso.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Christopher!\" gasped Lila, with a long breath, lifting her\\nlovely, pensive face. \"Oh, Christopher!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t wait; don\\'t put it off; don\\'t listen to any of us,\" he\\nurged impatiently. \"Good God! If you love him as you say you do,\\nwhy have you let all these years slip away?\"\\n\\n\"But you thought it was best, Christopher. You told me so.\"\\n\\n\"Best! There\\'s nothing best except to be happy if you get the\\nchance.\"\\n\\n\"He wants me to marry him now,\" said Lila, lowering her voice.\\n\"Mother will never know, he thinks, her mind grows so feeble; he\\nwants me to marry him without any getting ready--after church one\\nSunday morning.\"\\n\\nPutting his arm about her, Christopher held her for a moment\\nagainst his side. \"Then do it,\" he said gravely, as he stooped\\nand kissed her.\\n\\nAnd several weeks later, on a bright first Sunday in May, Lila\\nwas married, after morning services, in the little country\\nchurch, and Christopher watched her almost eagerly as she walked\\nhome across the broad meadows powdered white with daisies. To the\\nreproachful countenance which Cynthia presented to him upon his\\nreturn to the house he gave back a careless and defiant smile.\\n\\n\"So it\\'s all over,\" he announced gaily, \"and Lila\\'s married at\\nlast.\"\\n\\n\"Then you\\'re satisfied, I hope,\" rejoined Cynthia grimly, \"now\\nthat you\\'ve dragged us down to the level of the Weatherbys and--\\nthe Fletchers? There\\'s nothing more to be said about it, I\\nsuppose, and you may as well come in to dinner.\"\\n\\nShe held herself stiffly aloof from the subject, with her head\\nflung back and her chin expressing an indignant protest. There\\nwas a kind of rebellious scorn in the way in which she carved the\\nshoulder of bacon and poured the coffee.\\n\\n\"Good Lord! It\\'s such a little thing to make a fuss about,\" said\\nTucker, \"when you remember, my dear, that our levels aren\\'t any\\nbigger than chalk lines in the eyes of God Almighty.\"\\n\\nCynthia regarded him with squinting displeasure.\\n\\n\"Oh, of course; you have no family pride,\" she returned; \"but I\\nhad thought there was a little left in Christopher.\"\\n\\nChristopher shook his head, smiling indifferently. \"Not enough to\\nwant blood sacrifices,\" he responded, and fell into a detached\\nand thoughtful silence. The vision of Lila in her radiant\\nhappiness remained with him like a picture that one has beheld by\\nsome rare chance in a vivid and lovely light; and it was still\\nbefore him when he left the house presently and strolled slowly\\ndown to meet Maria by the poplar spring.\\n\\nThe bloom of the meadows filled his nostrils with a delicate\\nfragrance, and from the bough of an old apple-tree in the orchard\\nhe heard the low afternoon murmurs of a solitary thrush. May was\\non the earth, and it had entered into him as into the piping\\nbirds and the spreading trees. It was at last good to be alive--\\nto breathe the warm, sweet air, and to watch the sunshine\\nslanting on the low, green hill. So closely akin were his moods\\nto those of the changing seasons that, at the instant, he seemed\\nto feel the current of his being flow from the earth beneath his\\nfeet--as if his physical nature drew strength and nourishment\\nfrom that genial and abundant source.\\n\\nWhen he reached the spring he saw Maria appear on the brow of the\\nhill, and with a quick, joyous bound his heart leaped up to meet\\nher. As she came toward him her white dress swept the tall grass\\nfrom her feet, and her shadow flew like a winged creature\\nstraight before her. There was a vivid softness in her face--a\\nlook at once bright and wistful--which moved him with a new and\\nstrange tenderness.\\n\\n\"I was a little late,\" she explained, as they met before the long\\nbench and she laid her books upon it, \"and I am very warm. May I\\nhave a drink?\"\\n\\n\"From a bramble cup?\"\\n\\n\"How else?\" She took off her hat and tossed it on the grass at\\nher feet; then, going to the spring, she waited while he plucked\\na leaf from the bramble and bent it into shape. When he filled it\\nand held it out, she placed her lips to the edge of the leaf and\\nlooked up at him with smiling eyes while she drank slowly from\\nhis hand.\\n\\n\"It holds only a drop, but how delicious!\" she said, seating\\nherself again upon the bench and leaning back against the great\\nbody of a poplar. Then her eyes fell upon his clothes. \"Why, how\\nvery much dressed you look!\" she added.\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s a reason besides Sunday--I\\'ve just come from a\\nwedding. Lila has married after twelve years of waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Your pretty sister! And to whom?\"\\n\\n\"To Jim Weatherby--old Jacob\\'s son, you know. Now, don\\'t tell me\\nthat you disapprove. I count on your good sense to see the wisdom\\nof it.\"\\n\\n\"So it is your pretty sister,\" she said slowly, \"the woman I\\npassed in the road the other day and held my breath as I did\\nbefore Botticelli\\'s Venus.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so? Well, she doesn\\'t know much about pictures, nor does\\nJim. She has thrown herself away, Cynthia says, but what could\\nshe have waited for, after all? Nothing had ever come to her, and\\nshe had lived thirty years. Besides, she will be very happy, and\\nthat\\'s a good deal, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s everything,\" said Maria quietly, looking down into her lap.\\n\\n\"Everything? And if you had been born in her place?\"\\n\\n\"I am not in her place and never could be; but six years ago, if\\nI had been told that I must live here all my life, I think I\\nshould have fretted myself to death; that would have happened six\\nyears ago, for I was born with a great aching for life, and I\\nthought then that one could live only in the big outside world.\"\\n\\n\"And now?\" he questioned, for she paused and sat smiling gravely\\nat the book she held.\\n\\n\"Now I know that the fulness of life does not come from the\\nthings outside of us, and that we ourselves must create the\\nbeauty in which we live. Oh, I have learned so much from misery,\"\\nshe went on softly, \"and worst of all, I have learned what it is\\nto starve for bread in the midst of sugar-plums.\"\\n\\n\"And it was worth learning?\"\\n\\n\"The knowledge that I gained? Oh, yes, yes; for it taught me how\\nto be happy. I went down into hell,\" she said passionately, \"and\\nI came out--clean. I saw evil such as I had never heard of; I\\nwent close to it, I even touched it, but I always kept my soul\\nvery far away, and I was like a person in a dream. The more I saw\\nof sin and ugliness the more I dreamed of peace and beauty. I\\nbuilded me my own refuge, I fed on my own strength day and night\\n--and I am what I am--\"\\n\\n\"The loveliest woman on God\\'s earth,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You do not know me, \"she answered, and opened the book before\\nher. \"It was the story of the Holy Grail,\" she added, \"and we\\nleft off here. Oh, those brave days of King Arthur! It was always\\nMay then.\"\\n\\nHe touched the page lightly with a long blade of grass.\\n\\n\"Read yourself--this once,\" he pleaded, \"and let me listen.\"\\n\\nLeaning a little forward, she looked down and slowly turned the\\npages, her head bent over the book, her long lashes shading the\\nfaint flush in her cheeks. Over her white dress fell a delicate\\nlacework from the young poplar leaves, flecked here and there\\nwith pale drops of sunshine, which filtered through the thickly\\nclustered boughs. When the wind passed in the high tree-tops, the\\nshadows, soft and fine as cobweb, rippled over her dress, and a\\nloose strand of her dark hair waved gently about her ear. The\\nlife--the throbbing vitality within--her seemed to vivify the\\nvery air she breathed, and he felt all at once that the glad\\nthrill which stirred his blood was but a response to the fervent\\nspirit which spoke in her voice.\\n\\n\"For it giveth unto all lovers courage, that lusty month of May,\"\\nshe read, \"in something to constrain him to some manner of thing\\nmore in that month than in any other month--for then all herbs\\nand trees renew a man and woman, and in likewise lovers call\\nagain to mind old gentleness and old service and many kind deeds\\nthat were forgotten by negligence.\"\\n\\nThe words went like wine to his head, and he saw her shadowy\\nfigure recede and dissolve suddenly as in a mist. A lump rose in\\nhis throat, his heart leaped, and he felt his pulses beating\\nmadly in his temples. He drew back, closing his eves to shut out\\nher face; but the next instant, as she stirred slightly to hold\\ndown the rippling leaves, he bent forward and laid his hand upon\\nthe one that held the open book.\\n\\nHer voice fluttered into silence, and, raising her head, she\\nlooked up in tremulous surprise. He saw her face pale slowly, her\\nlids quiver and droop above her shining eyes, and her teeth gleam\\nmilk white between her parted lips. A tremor of alarm ran through\\nher, and she made a swift movement to escape; then, lifting her\\neyes again, she looked full into his own, and, stooping quickly,\\nhe kissed her on the mouth.\\n\\nAn instant afterward the book fell to the ground, and he rose to\\nhis feet and stood trembling against the body of the poplar.\\n\\n\"Forgive me,\" he said; \"forgive me--I have ruined it.\"\\n\\nStanding beside the bench, she watched him with a still, grave\\ngentleness before which his gaze dropped slowly to the ground.\\n\\n\"Yes, you have ruined this,\" she answered, smiling, \"but Latin is\\nstill left.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use,\" he went on breathlessly. \"I can\\'t do it; it\\'s no\\nuse.\"\\n\\nHis eyes sought hers and held them while he made a single step\\nforward; then, turning quickly away, he went from her across the\\nmeadow to the distant wood.\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK FIVE. The Ancient Law\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I. Christopher Seeks an Escape\\n\\nA clump of brambles caught at his feet, and, stumbling like a\\ndrunken man, he threw himself at full length upon the ground,\\npressing his forehead on the young, green thorns. A century\\nseemed to have passed since his flight from the poplar spring,\\nand yet the soft afternoon sunshine was still about him and the\\nlow murmurs of the thrush still floated from the old apple-tree.\\nAll the violence of his undisciplined nature had rushed into\\nrevolt against the surrender which he felt must come, and he was\\nconscious at the instant that he hated only a little less\\nsupremely than he loved. In the end the greater passion would\\ntriumph over him, he knew; but as he lay there face downward upon\\nthe earth the last evil instincts of his revenge battled against\\nthe remorse which had driven him from Maria\\'s presence. He saw\\nhimself clearly for what he was: he had learned at last to call\\nhis sin by its right name; and yet he felt that somewhere in the\\ndepths of his being he had not ceased to love the evil that he\\nhad done. He hated Fletcher, he told himself, as righteously as\\never, but between himself and the face of his enemy a veil had\\nfallen--the old wrong no longer stood out in a blaze of light. A\\nwoman\\'s smile divided him like a drawn sword from his brutal\\npast, and he had lost the reckless courage with which he once\\nmight have flung himself upon destruction.\\n\\nRising presently, he crossed the meadow and went slowly back to\\nhis work in the stables, keeping his thoughts with an effort upon\\nhis accustomed tasks. A great weariness for the endless daily\\nround of shall things was upon him, and he felt all at once that\\nthe emotion struggling within his heart must burst forth at last\\nand pervade the visible world. He was conscious of an impulse to\\nsing, to laugh, to talk in broken sentences to himself; and any\\nutterance, however slight and meaningless, seemed to relieve in a\\nmeasure the nervous tension of his thoughts.\\n\\nIn one instant there entered into him a desperate determination\\nto play the traitor--to desert his post and strike out boldly and\\nalone into the world. And with the next breath he saw himself\\nliving to old age as he had lived from boyhood--within reach of\\nMaria\\'s hand, meeting her fervent eyes, and yet separated from\\nher by a distance greater than God or man could bridge. With the\\nthought of her he saw again her faint smile which lingered always\\nabout her mouth, and his blood stirred at the memory of the kiss\\nwhich she had neither resisted nor returned.\\n\\nCynthia, searching for him a few minutes later, found him leaning\\nidly against the mare\\'s stall, looking down upon a half-finished\\nnest which a house-wren had begun to build upon his currycomb.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a pity to disturb that, Tucker would say,\" he observed,\\nmotioning toward the few wisps of straw on the ledge.\\n\\n\"Oh, she can start it somewhere else,\" replied Cynthia\\nindifferently. \"They have sent for you from the store,\\nChristopher--it\\'s something about one of the servants, I believe.\\nThey\\'re always getting into trouble and wanting you to pull them\\nout.\" The descendants of the old Blake slaves were still spoken\\nof by Cynthia as \"the servants,\" though they had been free men\\nand women for almost thirty years.\\n\\nChristopher started from his abstraction and turned toward her\\nwith a gesture of annoyance.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll have to go down, I suppose,\" he said. \"Has mother\\nasked for me to-day?\"\\n\\n\"Only for Jim again--it\\'s always Jim now. I declare, I believe we\\nmight all move away and she\\'d never know the difference so long\\nas he was left. She forgets us entirely sometimes, and fancies\\nthat father is alive again.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good thing Jim amuses her, at any rate.\"\\n\\nAn expression of anger drew Cynthia\\'s brows together. \"Oh, I dare\\nsay; but it does seem hard that she should have grown to dislike\\nme after all I\\'ve done for her. There are times when she won\\'t\\nlet me even come in the room--when she\\'s not herself, you know.\"\\n\\nHer words were swallowed in a sob, and he stood staring at her in\\nan amazement too sudden to be mixed with pity.\\n\\n\"And you have given up your whole life to her,\" he exclaimed.\\nappalled by the injustice of the god of sacrifice.\\n\\nCynthia put up one knotted hand and stroked back the thin hair\\nupon her temples. \"It was all I had to give,\" she answered, and\\nwent out into the yard.\\n\\nHe let her go from him without replying, and before her pathetic\\nfigure had reached the house she was blotted entirely from his\\nthoughts, for it was a part of the tragedy of her unselfishness\\nthat she had never existed as a distinct personality even in the\\nminds of those who knew and loved her.\\n\\nWhen presently he passed through the yard on his way to the\\nstore, he saw her taking in the dried clothes from the old\\nlilac-bushes and called back carelessly that he would be home to\\nsupper. Then, forgetting her lesser miseries in his own greater\\none, he fell into his troubled brooding as he swung rapidly along\\nthe road.\\n\\nAt the store the usual group of loungers welcomed him, and among\\nthem he saw to his surprise the cheerful face of Jim Weatherby, a\\nlittle clouded by the important news he was evidently seeking to\\nhold back.\\n\\n\"I tried to keep them from sending for you, Christopher,\" the\\nyoung man explained. \"It is no business of yours--that is what I\\nsaid.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it seems that every thriftless nigger in the county thinks\\nhe\\'s got a claim upon you, sho\\' enough,\" put in Tom Spade. \"It\\nwarn\\'t mo\\'n last week that I had a letter from the grandson of\\nyo\\' pa\\'s old blacksmith Buck, sayin\\' he was to hang in\\nPhiladelphia for somebody\\'s murder, an\\' that I must tell Marse\\nChristopher to come an\\' git him off. Thar\\'s a good six hunnard of\\n\\'em, black an\\' yaller an\\' it\\'s God A\\'mighty or Marse Christopher\\nto \\'em every one.\"\\n\\n\"What is it now?\" asked Christopher a little wearily, taking off\\nhis hat and running his hand through his thick, fair hair. \"If\\nanybody\\'s been stealing chickens they\\'ve got to take the\\nconsequences.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not chicken stealin\\' this time; it\\'s a blamed sight\\nworse. They want you to send somebody over to Uncle Isam\\'s--you\\nremember his little cabin, five miles off in Alorse\\'s woods--to\\nhelp him bury his children who have died of smallpox. There are\\nfour of \\'em dead, it seems, an\\' the rest are all down with the\\ndisease. Thar\\'s not a morsel of food in the house, an\\' not a\\nlivin\\' nigger will go nigh \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Uncle Isam!\" repeated Christopher, as if trying to recall the\\nname. \"Why, I haven\\'t laid eyes upon the man for years.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely; but he\\'s sent you a message by a boy who was\\ngathering pine knots at the foot of his hill. He was to tell\\nMarse Christopher that he had had nothing to eat for two whole\\ndays an\\' his children were unburied. Then the boy got scared an\\'\\nscampered off, an\\' that was all.\"\\n\\nChristopher\\'s laugh sounded rather brutal.\\n\\n\"So he used to belong to us, did he?\" he inquired.\\n\\n\"He was yo\\' pa\\'s own coachman. I recollect him plain as day,\"\\nanswered Tom. \"I warn\\'t \\'mo\\'n a child then, an\\' he used to flick\\nhis whip at my bare legs whenever he passed me in the road.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what is to be done?\" asked Christopher, turning suddenly\\nupon him.\\n\\n\"The Lord He knows, suh. Thar\\'s not a nigger as will go nigh him,\\nan\\' I\\'m not blamin\\' \\'em; not I. Jim\\'s filled his cart with food,\\nan\\' he\\'s goin\\' to dump the things out at the foot of the hill;\\nthen maybe Uncle Isam can crawl down an\\' drag \\'em back. His\\nwife\\'s down with it, too, they say. She was workin\\' here not mo\\'n\\nsix months ago, but she left her place of a sudden an\\' went back\\nagain.\"\\n\\nChristopher glanced carelessly at the little cart waiting in the\\nroad, and then throwing off his coat tossed it on the seat.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll trouble you to lend me your overalls, Tom,\" he said, \"and\\nyou can send a boy up to the house and get mine in exchange. Put\\nwhat medicines you have in the cart; I\\'ll take them over to the\\nold fool.\"\\n\\n\"Good Lord!\" said Tom, and mechanically got out of his blue jean\\nclothes.\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t be a downright ass, Christopher,\" put in Jim\\nWeatherby. \"You\\'ve got your mother on your hands, you know, and\\nwhat under heaven have you to do with Uncle Isam? I knew some\\nfoolishness would most likely come of it if they sent up for\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he used to belong to us, you see,\" explained Christopher\\ncarelessly.\\n\\n\"And he\\'s been an ungrateful, thriftless free Negro for nearly\\nthirty years--\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just it--for not quite thirty years. Look here, if you\\'ll\\ndrive me over in the cart and leave the things at the foot of the\\nhill I\\'ll be obliged to you. I\\'ll probably have to stay out a\\ncouple of weeks--until there\\'s no danger of my bringing back the\\ndisease--so I\\'ll wear Tom\\'s overalls and leave my clothes\\nsomewhere in the woods. Oh, I\\'ll take care, of course; I\\'m no\\nfool.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re surer of that than I am,\" returned Jim, thinking of Lila.\\n\"I can\\'t help feeling that there\\'s some truth in father\\'s saying\\nthat a man can\\'t be a hero without being a bit of a fool as well.\\nFor God\\'s sake, don\\'t, Christopher. You have no right--\"\\n\\n\"No, I have no right,\" repeated Christopher, as he got into the\\ncart and took up the hanging reins. A sudden animation had leaped\\ninto his face and his eyes were shining. It was the old love of a\\n\"risk for the sake of the risk\" which to Tucker had always seemed\\nto lack the moral elements of true courage, and the careless\\ngaiety with which he spoke robbed the situation of its underlying\\nsomber horror.\\n\\nJim swung himself angrily upon the seat and touched the horse\\nlightly with the whip. \"And there\\'s your mother sitting at\\nhome--and Cynthia--and Lila,\" he said.\\n\\nChristopher turned on him a face in whose expression he found a\\nmystery that he could not solve.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t help it, Jim, to save my life I can\\'t,\" he answered. \"It\\nisn\\'t anything heroic; you know that as well as I. I don\\'t care a\\nstraw for Uncle Isam and his children, but if I didn\\'t go up\\nthere and bury those dead darkies I\\'d never have a moment\\'s\\npeace. I\\'ve been everything but a skulking coward, and I can\\'t\\nturn out to be that at the end. It\\'s the way I\\'m made.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I dare say we\\'re made different,\" responded Jim rather\\ndryly, for it was his wedding day and he was going farther from\\nhis bride. \"But for my part, I can\\'t help thinking of that poor\\nblind old lady, and how helpless they all are. Yes, we\\'re made\\ndifferent. I reckon that\\'s what it means.\"\\n\\nThe cart jogged on slowly through the fading sunshine, and when\\nat last it came to the foot of the hill where Uncle Isam lived\\nChristopher got out and shouldered a bag of meal.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll run the place, I know, and look after mother while I\\'m\\naway,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Oh, I suppose I\\'ll have to,\" returned Jim; and then his ill-\\nhumour vanished and he smiled and held out his hand. \"Good-by,\\nold man. God bless you,\" he said heartily.\\n\\nSitting there in the road, he watched Christopher pass out of\\nsight under the green leaves, stooping slightly beneath the bag\\nof meal and whistling a merry scrap of an old song. At the\\ninstant it came to Jim with the force of a blow that this was the\\nfirst cheerful sound he had heard from him for weeks; and, still\\npondering, he turned the horse\\'s head and drove slowly home to\\nhis own happiness.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. The Measure of Maria\\n\\nWhen, two weeks later, Christopher reached home again, he was met\\nby Tucker\\'s gentle banter and Lila\\'s look of passionate reproach.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, you might have died!\" breathed the girl with a\\nshudder.\\n\\nChristopher laughed.\\n\\n\"So might Uncle Tucker when he went into the war,\" was his\\nretort. He was a little thinner, a little graver, and the sunburn\\nupon his face had faded to a paler shade. After the short absence\\nhis powerful figure struck them as almost gigantic; physically,\\nhe had never appeared more impressive than he did standing there\\nin the sunlight that filled the kitchen doorway.\\n\\n\"But that was different,\" protested Lila, flushing, \"and this-\\nthis--why, you hardly knew Uncle Isam when you passed him in the\\nroad.\"\\n\\n\"And half the time forgot to speak to him,\" added Tucker,\\nlaughing. His eyes were on the young man\\'s figure, and they grew\\na little wistful, as they always did in the presence of perfect\\nmasculine strength. \"Well, I\\'m glad your search for adventures\\ndidn\\'t end in disaster,\" he added pleasantly.\\n\\nTo Christopher\\'s surprise, Cynthia was the single member of the\\nfamily who showed a sympathy with his reckless knight errantry.\\n\"There was nothing else for you to do, of course,\" she said in a\\nresolute voice, lifting her worn face where the lines had\\ndeepened in his absence; \"he used to be father\\'s coachman before\\nthe war.\"\\n\\nShe had gone from the kitchen as she spoke, and Christopher,\\nfollowing her, threw an anxious glance along the little platform\\nto the closed door of the house.\\n\\n\"And mother, Cynthia?\" he asked quickly.\\n\\n\"Her mind still wanders, but at times she seems to come back to\\nherself for a little while, and only this morning she awoke from\\na nap and asked for you quite clearly. We told her you had gone\\nhunting.\"\\n\\n\"May I see her now? Who is with her?\"\\n\\n\"Jim. He has been so good.\"\\n\\nThe admission was wrung shortly from her rigid honesty, and there\\nwas no visible softening of her grim reserve, when, entering the\\nhouse with Christopher, she found herself presently beside Jim\\nWeatherby, who was chatting merrily in Mrs. Blake\\'s room.\\n\\nThe old lady, shrivelled and faded as the dried goldenrod which\\nfilled the great jars on the hearth, lay half hidden among the\\npillows in her high white bed, her vacant eyes fixed upon the\\nsunshine which fell through the little window. At Christopher\\'s\\nstep her memory flickered back for an instant, and the change\\nshowed in the sudden animation of her glance.\\n\\n\"I was dreaming of your father, my son, and you have his voice.\"\\n\\n\"I am like him in other ways, I hope, mother.\"\\n\\n\"If I could only see you, Christopher--it is so hard to remember.\\nYou had golden curls and wore a white pinafore. I trimmed it with\\nthe embroidery from my last set of petticoats. And your hands\\nwere dimpled all over; you would suck your thumb: there was no\\nbreaking you, though I wrapped it in a rag soaked in quinine--\"\\n\\n\"That was almost thirty years ago, mother,\" broke in Cynthia,\\ncatching her breath sharply. \"He is a man now, and big--oh, so\\nbig--and his hair has grown a little darker.\"\\n\\n\"I know, Cynthia; I know,\" returned Mrs. Blake, with a peevish\\nmovement of her thin hand, \"but you won\\'t let me remember. I am\\ntrying to remember.\" She fell to whimpering like a hurt child,\\nand then growing suddenly quiet, reached out until she touched\\nChristopher\\'s head. \"You\\'re a man, I know,\" she said, \"older than\\nyour father was when his first child was born. There have been\\ntwo crosses in my life, Christopher--my blindness and my never\\nhaving heard the voices of my grandchildren playing in the house.\\nSuch a roomy old house, too, with so much space for them to fill\\nwith cheerful noise. I always liked noise, you know; it tells of\\nlife, and never disturbs me so long as it is pleasant. What I\\nhate is the empty silence that reminds one of the grave.\"\\n\\nShe was quite herself now, and, bending over, he kissed the hand\\nupon the counterpane.\\n\\n\"Oh, mother, mother, if I could only have made you happy!\"\\n\\n\"And you couldn\\'t, Christopher?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t marry, dear; I couldn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"There was no one, you mean--no woman whom you could have loved\\nand who would have given you children. Surely there are still\\ngood and gentle women left in the world.\"\\n\\n\"There was none for me.\"\\n\\nShe sighed hopelessly.\\n\\n\"You have never--never had a low fancy, Christopher?\"\\n\\n\"Never, mother.\"\\n\\n\"Thank God; it is one thing I could not forgive. A gentleman may\\nhave his follies, your father used to say, but he must never\\nstoop for them. Let him keep to his own level, even in his\\nindiscretions. Ah, your father had his faults, my son, but he\\nnever forgot for one instant in his life that he was born a\\ngentleman. He was a good husband, too, a good husband, and I was\\nmarried to him for nearly forty years. The greatest trial of my\\nmarriage was that he would throw his cigar ashes on the floor.\\nWomen think so much of little things, you know, and I\\'ve always\\nfelt that I should have been a happier woman if he had learned to\\nuse an ash-tray. But he never would--he never would, though I\\ngave him one every Christmas for almost forty years.\"\\n\\nFalling silent, her hands played fitfully upon the counterpane,\\nand when next she spoke the present had slipped from her and her\\nthoughts had gone back to her early triumphs.\\n\\nShe wandered aimlessly and waveringly on in a feeble vacancy, and\\nChristopher, after watching her for an agonised moment, left the\\nroom and went out into the fresh air of the yard. He could always\\nescape by flight from the slow death-bed; it was Cynthia who\\nfaced hourly the final tragedy of a long and happy life.\\n\\nThe thought of Will had oppressed him like a nightmare for the\\nlast two weeks, and it was almost unconsciously that he tuned now\\nin the direction of the store and passed presently into the\\nshaded lane leading to Sol Peterkin\\'s. His mood was heavy upon\\nhim, and so deep was the abstraction in which he walked that it\\nwas only when he heard his name called softly from a little\\ndistance that he looked up to find Maria Fletcher approaching him\\nover the pale gray shadows in the road. Her eyes were luminous,\\nand she stretched her hand toward him in a happy gesture.\\n\\n\"Oh, if you only knew how wonderful I think you!\" she cried\\nimpulsively.\\n\\nHe held her hand an instant, and then letting it fall, withdrew\\nhis gaze slowly from her exalted look. The pure heights of her\\nfervour were beyond the reach of his more earthly level, and as\\nhe turned from her some old words of her own were respoken in his\\nears: \"Faith and doubt are mere empty forms until we pour out the\\nheart\\'s blood that vivifies them.\" It was her heart\\'s blood that\\nshe had put into her dreams, and it was this, he told himself,\\nthat gave her mystic visions their illusive appearance of\\nreality. Beauty enveloped her as an atmosphere; it softened her\\nsternest sacrifice, it coloured her barest outlook, it\\ntransformed daily the common road in which she walked, and hourly\\nit sustained and nourished her, as it nourished poor, crippled\\nTucker on his old pine bench. The eye of the spirit was\\ntheirs--this Christopher had learned at last; and he had learned,\\nalso, that for him there still remained only the weak, blurred\\nvision of the flesh.\\n\\n\"You make me feel the veriest hypocrite,\" he said at the end of\\nthe long pause.\\n\\nShe shook her head. \"And that you are surely not.\"\\n\\n\"So you still believe in me?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not belief--I KNOW in you.\"\\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t praise me; don\\'t admire me; don\\'t pretend, for God\\'s\\nsake, that I\\'m anything better than the brute you see.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t pretend anything better,\" she protested; \"and when you\\ntalk like this it only makes me feel the more keenly your\\nwonderful courage.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t any,\" he burst out almost angrily. \"Not an atom, do\\nyou hear? Whatever I may appear on top, at bottom I am a great\\nskulking coward, and nothing more. Why, I couldn\\'t even stay and\\ntake my punishment the other day. I sneaked off like a hound.\"\\n\\n\"Your punishment?\" she faltered, and he saw her lashes tremble.\\n\\n\"For the other day--for the afternoon by the poplar spring. I\\'ve\\nbeen wanting to beg your pardon on my knees.\"\\n\\nHer lashes were raised steadily, and she regarded him gravely\\nwhile a slight frown gathered her dark brows. She was still\\nhumanly feminine enough to find the apology harder to forgive\\nthan the offense.\\n\\n\"Oh, I had forgotten,\" she said a little coldly. \"So that was,\\nafter all, why you ran away?\"\\n\\n\"It was not the only reason.\"\\n\\n\"And the other?\"\\n\\nHe closed his eyes suddenly and drew back.\\n\\n\"I ran away because I knew if I stayed I should do it again\\nwithin two seconds,\" he replied.\\n\\nA little blue flower was growing in the red clay wheel-rut at her\\nfeet, and, stooping, she caressed it gently without plucking it.\\n\\n\"It was very foolish,\" she said in a quiet voice; \"but I had\\nforgotten it, and you should have let it rest. Afterward, you did\\nsuch a brave, splendid thing.\"\\n\\n\"I did nothing but run from you,\" he persisted, losing his head.\\n\"If I hadn\\'t gone to Uncle Isam I\\'d have done something equally\\nreckless in a different way. I wanted to get away from you--to\\nescape you, but I couldn\\'t--I couldn\\'t. You were with me always,\\nnight and day, in those God-forsaken woods. I never lost you for\\none instant, never. I tried to, but I couldn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t,\" she repeated, and, rising, faced him calmly. Then\\nbefore the look in his eyes her own wavered and fell slowly to\\nthe ground, and he saw her quiver and grow white as if a rough\\nwind blew over her. With an effort he steadied himself and turned\\naway.\\n\\n\"There is but one thing to do,\" he said, holding his breath in\\nthe pause; \"it\\'s a long story, but if you will listen\\npatiently--and it is very long--I will tell you all.\" Following\\nhim, she crossed the carpet of pine needles and sat down upon the\\nend of a fallen log.\\n\\n\"Tell me nothing that you do not care to,\" she answered, and sat\\nwaiting.\\n\\n\"It began long ago, when we were both little children,\" he went\\non, and then going back from her into the lane he stood staring\\ndown upon the little blue flower blooming in the wheel-rut. She\\nsaw his shadow, stretching across the road, blurred into the pale\\ndusk of the wood, uncertain, somber, gigantic in its outline. His\\nhat was lying on the ground at her feet, and, lifting it, she ran\\nher fingers idly along the brim.\\n\\nFor a time the silence lasted; then coming back to her, he sat\\ndown on the log and dropped his clasped hands between his knees.\\nShe heard his heavy breathing, and something in the sound drew\\nher toward him with a sympathetic movement.\\n\\n\"Ah, don\\'t tell me, don\\'t tell me,\" she entreated.\\n\\n\"You must listen patiently,\" he returned, without looking at her,\\n\"and not interrupt--above all, not interrupt.\"\\n\\nShe bent her head. \"I will not speak a word nor move a finger\\nuntil the end,\" she promised; and leaning a little forward, with\\nhis eyes on the ground and his hands hanging listlessly between\\nhis knees, he began his story.\\n\\nThe air was so still that his voice sounded strangely harsh in\\nthe silence, but presently she heard the soughing of the pine\\ntrees far up above, and while it lasted it deadened the jarring\\ndiscord of the human tones. She sat quite motionless upon the\\nlog, not lifting a finger nor speaking a word, as she had\\npromised, and her gaze was fixed steadily upon a bit of dried\\nfern growing between the roots of a dead tree.\\n\\n\"It went on so for five years,\" he slowly finished, \"and it was\\nfrom beginning to end deliberate, devilish revenge. I meant from\\nthe first to make him what he is to-day. I meant to make him hate\\nhis grandfather as he does--I meant to make him the hopeless\\ndrunkard that he is. It is all my work--every bit of it--as you\\nsee it now.\"\\n\\nHe paused, but her eyes clung to the withered fern, and so quiet\\nwas her figure that it seemed as if she had not drawn breath\\nsince he began. Her faint smile was still sketched about the\\ncorners of her mouth, and her fingers were closed upon the brim\\nof his harvest hat.\\n\\n\"For five years I was like that,\" he went on again. \"I did not\\nknow, I did not care--I wanted to be a beast. Then you came and\\nit was different.\"\\n\\nFor the first time she turned and looked at him.\\n\\n\"And it was different?\" she repeated beneath her breath.\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'s nothing to say that will make things better; I know\\nthat. If you had not come I should never have known myself nor\\nwhat I had been. It was like a thunderclap--the whole thing; it\\nshook me off my feet before I saw what it meant--before I would\\nacknowledge even to myself that--\"\\n\\n\"That?\" she questioned in a whisper, for he had bitten back the\\nwords.\\n\\n\"That I love you.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke she slipped suddenly to her knees and lay with her\\nface hidden on the old log, while her smothered sobs ran in long\\nshudders through her body. A murmur reached him presently, and it\\nseemed to him that she was praying softly in her clasped hands;\\nbut when in a new horror of himself he made a movement to rise\\nand slip away, she looked up and gently touched him detainingly\\non the arm.\\n\\n\"Oh, how unhappy--how unhappy you have been!\" she said.\\n\\n\"It is not that I mind,\" he answered. \"If I could take all the\\nmisery of it I shouldn\\'t care, but I have made you suffer, and\\nfor the sin that is mine alone.\"\\n\\nFor a moment she was silent, breathing quickly between parted\\nlips; then turning with an impulsive gesture, she laid her cheek\\nupon the hand hanging at his side.\\n\\n\"Not yours alone,\" she said softly, \"for it has become mine,\\ntoo.\"\\n\\nBefore the wonder of her words he stared at her with dazed eyes,\\nwhile their meaning shook him slowly to his senses.\\n\\n\"Maria!\" he called out sharply in the voice of one who speaks\\nfrom a distance.\\n\\nShe met his appeal with a swift outward movement of her arms,\\nand, bending over, laid her hands gently upon his head.\\n\\n\"Mine, too, Christopher--mine, too,\" she repeated, \"for I take\\nthe blame of it, and I will share in the atonement. My dear, my\\ndear, is love so slight a thing that it would share the joy and\\nleave the sorrow--that it would take the good and reject the\\nevil? Why, it is all mine! All! All! What you have been I was\\nalso; what I am to-day you will be. I have been yours since the\\nfirst instant you looked upon me.\"\\n\\nWith a sob he caught her hands and crushed them in his own.\\n\\n\"Then this is love, Maria?\"\\n\\n\"It has been love--always.\"\\n\\n\"From the first--as with me?\"\\n\\n\"As with you. Beloved, there is not a wrong on this earth that\\ncould come between us now, for there is no room in my heart where\\nit might enter. There can be no sin against love which love does\\nnot acknowledge.\"\\n\\nFalling apart, their hands dropped before them, and they stood\\nlooking at each other in a silence that went deeper than words.\\nShe felt his gaze enveloping her in warmth from head to foot, but\\nhe still made no movement to draw nearer, for there are moments\\nwhen the touch of the flesh grows meaningless before the mute\\nappeal of the spirit. In that one speechless instant there passed\\nbetween them the pledges and the explanations of years.\\n\\nSuddenly the light flamed in his face, and opening his arms, he\\nmade a single step toward her; but melting into tears, she turned\\nfrom him and ran out into the road.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. Will\\'s Ruin\\n\\nBlinded by tears, she went swiftly back along the road into the\\nshadows which thickened beyond the first short bend. Will must be\\nsaved at any cost, by any sacrifice, she told herself with\\npassionate insistence. He must be saved though she gave up her\\nwhole life to the work of his redemption, though she must stand\\ndaily and hourly guard against his weakness. He must be saved,\\nnot for his own sake alone, but because it was the one way in\\nwhich she might work out Christopher\\'s salvation. As she went on,\\nscheme after scheme beckoned and repelled her; plan after plan\\nwas caught at only to be rejected, and it was at last with a\\nsinking heart, though still full of high resolves, that she\\nturned from the lane into a strip of \"corduroy road,\" and so came\\nquickly to the barren little farm adjoining Sol Peterkin\\'s.\\n\\nWill was sitting idly on an overturned wheelbarrow beside the\\nwoodpile, and as she approached him she assumed with an effort a\\nface of cheerful courage.\\n\\n\"Oh, Will, I thought you\\'d gone to work. You promised me!\"\\n\\n\"Well, I haven\\'t, and there\\'s an end of it,\" he returned\\nirritably, chewing hard on a chip he had picked up from the\\nground; \"and what\\'s more, I shan\\'t go till I see the use. It\\'s\\nkilling me by inches. I tell you I\\'m not strong enough to stand a\\nlife like this. Drudge, drudge, drudge; there\\'s nothing else\\nexcept the little spirit I get from drink.\"\\n\\n\"And that ruins you. Oh, don\\'t, don\\'t. I\\'ll go on my knees to\\nyou; I\\'ll work for you like a servant day and night; I\\'ll sell my\\nvery clothes to help you, if you\\'ll only promise me never to\\ndrink again.\"\\n\\n\"You a servant!\" said Will, and laughed shortly while he looked\\nher over with raised eyebrows. \"Why, your stockings would keep me\\nin cigarettes for a week.\"\\n\\nA flush crossed Maria\\'s face, and she glanced down guiltily,\\nletting her black skirt fall above the lace upon her petticoat.\\n\"I have bought nothing since coming home,\" she responded\\npresently with quiet dignity; \"these belong, with my old\\nluxuries, to a past life. There were a great many of them, and it\\nwill fortunately take me a long time to wear them out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t begrudge them,\" returned Will; a little ashamed of\\nhis show of temper; \"fine clothes suit you, and I hope you will\\nsqueeze them out of grandpa all you can. It\\'s as good a way for\\nhim to spend his money as any other, and it doesn\\'t hurt me so\\nlong as he\\'ll never let me see the colour of a cent.\"\\n\\n\"But your promise, dear? Will you promise me?\"\\n\\nHe lifted his sullen face toward her kind eyes, then turning\\naway, kicked listlessly at the rotting chips.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the use in promising? I wouldn\\'t keep it,\" he replied.\\n\"Why, there are times when but for whisky I\\'d go mad. It\\'s the\\nlife, I tell you, that\\'s killing me, not drink. If things were\\ndifferent I shouldn\\'t crave it--I shouldn\\'t miss it, even. Why,\\nfor three months after I married Molly I didn\\'t touch a single\\ndrop, and I\\'d have kept it up, too, except for grandpa\\'s\\ndevilment. It\\'s his fault; he drove me back to it as clear as\\nday.\"\\n\\nHis weak mouth quivered, and he sucked in his breath in the way\\nhe had inherited from Fletcher. The deep flush across his face\\nfaded slowly, and dropping his restless, bloodshot eyes, he dug\\nhis foot into the mould with spasmodic twitches of his body. His\\nclothes appeared to have been flung upon him, and his cravat and\\nloosened collar betrayed the lack of neatness which had always\\nrepelled Maria so strongly in her grandfather. As she watched him\\nshe wondered with a pang that she had never noticed until to-day\\nthe resemblance he bore to the old man at the Hall.\\n\\n\"But one must be patient, Will,\" she said helplessly after a\\nmoment\\'s thought; \"there\\'s always hope of a mending--and as far\\nas that goes, grandfather may relent tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"Relent? Pshaw! I\\'d like to see him do it this side of hell. Let\\nhim die; that\\'s all I ask of him. His room is a long sight better\\nthan his company, and you may tell him I said so.\"\\n\\n\"What good would come of that?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want any good to come of it. Why should I? He\\'s brought\\nme to this pass with his own hand.\"\\n\\n\"But surely it was partly your fault. He loved you once.\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense. He wanted a dog to badger, that was all. Christopher\\nBlake said so.\"\\n\\n\"Christopher Blake! Oh, Will, Will, if you could only\\nunderstand!\"\\n\\nShe turned hopelessly away from him and looked with despairing\\neyes over the ploughed fields which blushed faintly in the\\nsunshine.\\n\\n\"So your spring ploughing is all done,\" she said at last,\\ndesisting from her attempt to soften his sullen obduracy, \"and\\nyou have been working harder than I knew.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not I,\" returned Will promptly, his face clearing for\\nthe first time. \"It\\'s all Christopher\\'s work; he ploughed that\\nfield just before he went away. Do you see that new cover over\\nthe well? He knocked that up the last morning he was here, and\\nmade those steps before the front door at the same time. Now,\\nhe\\'s the kind of friend worth having, and no mistake. But for him\\nI\\'d have landed in the poorhouse long ago.\"\\n\\nMaria\\'s gaze left the field and returned to Will\\'s face, where it\\nlingered wistfully.\\n\\n\"Have you ever heard what it was all about, Will?\" she asked,\\n\"the old trouble between him and grandfather?\"\\n\\n\"Some silly property right, I believe; I can\\'t remember. Did you\\never see anybody yet with whom grandpa was on decent terms?\"\\n\\n\"He used to be with you, Will.\"\\n\\n\"Only so long as I wore short breeches and he could whack me over\\nthe head whenever he had a mind to. I tell you I\\'d rather try to\\nget along with Beelzebub himself.\"\\n\\n\"Have you ever tried peace-making in earnest, I wonder?\"\\n\\nTwirling a chip between his thumb and forefinger, he flirted it\\nangrily at a solitary hen scratching in the mould.\\n\\n\"Why, shortly after my marriage I went over there and positively\\nwiped up the floor with myself. I offered him everything under\\nheaven in the shape of good behaviour, and, by Jove! I meant it,\\ntoo. I\\'d have stopped drinking then; I\\'d even have given up\\nChristopher Blake--\"\\n\\n\"Did you tell him that?\"\\n\\n\"Did I ever tell a thunderstorm I\\'d run indoors? It was enough to\\nget away with a whole skin--he left me little more. And the day\\nafterward, by the way, he sent me the deeds to this rotten farm,\\nand warned me that he\\'d shoot me down if I ever set foot at the\\nHall.\"\\n\\n\"And there has been no softening--no wavering since?\"\\n\\nWill shook his head with a brutal laugh. \"Oh, you heard of our\\nmeeting in the road and what came of it. I told him I was\\nstarving: he answered that he wasn\\'t responsible for all the\\nworthless paupers in the county. Then I cursed him, and he broke\\nhis stick on my shoulders. I say, Maria,\" he wound up\\ndesperately, \"do you think he\\'ll live forever?\"\\n\\nShe kept her eyes upon him without answering, fearing to tell him\\nthat by the terms of the new will he could never come into his\\nshare of Fletcher\\'s wealth.\\n\\n\"Has he ever seen Molly?\" she asked suddenly, while an\\nunreasonable hope shot through her heart. \"Does he know about the\\nchild?\"\\n\\n\"He may have seen her--I don\\'t know; but she\\'s not so much to\\nlook at now: she\\'s gone all to pieces under this awful worry. It\\nisn\\'t my fault, God knows, but she expected different things when\\nshe married me. She thought we\\'d live somewhere in the city and\\nthat she\\'d have pretty clothes to wear.\"\\n\\n\"I was thinking that when the child came he might forgive you,\"\\nbroke in Maria almost cheerfully.\\n\\n\"And in the meantime we\\'re to die like rats. Oh, there\\'s no use\\ntalking, it\\'s got to end one way or another. There\\'s not a cent\\nin the house nor a decent scrap of food, and Molly is having to\\nsee the doctor every day. I declare, it\\'s enough to drive me\\nclean to desperation!\"\\n\\n\"And what good would that do Molly or yourself? Be a man, Will,\\nand don\\'t let a woman hear you whine. Now I\\'m going in to see\\nher, and I\\'ll stay to help her about supper.\"\\n\\nShe nodded brightly, and, opening the little door of the house,\\npassed into the single lower room which served as kitchen and\\ndining-room in one. Beyond the disorderly table, from which the\\nremains of dinner had not yet been cleared away, Molly was lying\\non a hard wooden lounge covered with strips of faded calico. Her\\nabundant flaxen hair hung in lusterless masses upon her\\nshoulders, and the soiled cotton wrapper she wore was torn open\\nat the throat as if she had clutched it in a passion of childish\\npetulance. At Maria\\'s entrance she started and looked up angrily\\nfrom her dejected attitude.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see any visitors--I\\'m not fit!\" she cried.\\n\\nMarie drew forward a broken split--bottomed chair and sat down\\nbeside the lounge.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not a visitor, Molly,\" she answered; \"and I\\'ve come to see\\nif I can\\'t make you a little easier. Won\\'t you let me fix you\\ncomfortably? Why, you poor child, your hands are as hot as fire!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m hot all over,\" returned Molly peevishly; \"and I\\'m sick--I\\'m\\nas sick as I can be. Will won\\'t believe it, but the doctor says\\nso.\"\\n\\n\"Will does believe it, and it worries him terribly. Here, sit up\\nand let me bathe your face and hands in cold water. Doesn\\'t that\\nfeel better?\"\\n\\n\"A little,\" admitted Molly, when Maria had found a towel and\\ndried her hands.\\n\\n\"And now I\\'m going to comb the tangles out of your hair. What\\nlovely hair! It is the colour of ripe corn.\"\\n\\nA pleased flush brightened Molly\\'s face, and she resigned herself\\neasily to Maria\\'s willing services. \"There\\'s a comb over there on\\nthat shelf under the mirror,\" she said. \"Will broke half the\\nteeth out of it the other day, and it pulls my hair out when I\\nuse it.\"\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll bring you one of mine. You must be careful of these\\ncurls. They\\'re too pretty to treat roughly. Do I hurt you?\"\\n\\nAs she spoke, a bright strand of the girl\\'s hair twisted about\\none of her rings, and after hesitating an instant she drew the\\ncircle from her finger and laid it in Molly\\'s lap.\\n\\n\"There. I haven\\'t any money, so that\\'s to buy you medicine and\\nfood,\" she said. \"It cost a good deal once, I fancy.\"\\n\\n\"Diamonds!\" gasped Molly, with a cry of rapture.\\n\\nHer hand closed over the ring with a frantic clutch; then\\nslipping it on, she lay watching the stone sparkle in the last\\nsunbeams. A colour had bloomed suddenly in her face, and her eyes\\nshone with a light as brilliant as that of the jewel at which she\\ngazed.\\n\\n\"And you had--others?\" she asked in a kind of sacred awe.\\n\\n\"A great many once--a necklace, and rings, and brooches, and a\\nsilly tiara that made me look a fright. I never cared for them\\nafter the novelty of owning them wore off. They are evil things,\\nit seems to me, and should never be the gifts of love, for each\\none of those foolish stones stands for greed, and pride, and\\nselfishness, and maybe crime. That was my way of looking at them,\\nof course, and whenever I wore my necklace I used to feel like\\nasking pardon of every beggar that I passed. \\'One link in this\\nchain might make a man of you,\\' was what I wanted to say--but I\\nnever did. Well, they are almost all gone now; some I sold and\\nsome I gave away. This one will buy you medicine, I hope, and\\nthen it will give me more happiness than it has ever done\\nbefore.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it is beautiful, beautiful,\" sighed Molly beneath her\\nbreath, and then went to the little cracked mirror in the corner\\nand held the diamond first to her ear and then against her hair.\\n\"They suit me,\" she said at last, opening the bosom of her\\nwrapper and trying it on her pretty throat; \"they would make me\\nlook so splendid. Oh, if I\\'d only had a lover who could give me\\nthings like this!\"\\n\\nMaria, watching her, felt her heart contract suddenly with a pang\\nof remembrance. Jewels had been the one thing which Jack Wyndham\\nhad given her, for of the finer gifts of the spirit he had been\\nbeggared long before she knew him. In the first months of his\\ninfatuation he had showered her with diamonds, and she had grown\\npresently to see a winking mockery in each bauble that he tossed\\nher. Before the first year was ended she had felt her pride\\nbroken by the oppressiveness of the jewels that bedecked her\\nbody, like the mystic princess who was killed at last by the\\nmaterial weight of the golden crown upon her brow.\\n\\n\"They could never make you happy, Molly. How could they? Come\\nback and lie down, and let me put the ring away. Perhaps I\\'d\\nbetter take it to town myself.\" But Molly would not open her\\nclosed hand on which the diamond shone; and long after Maria had\\ncooked supper and gone back to the Hall the girl lay motionless,\\nholding the ring against the light. When Will came in from\\nmilking she showed it to him with a burst of joy.\\n\\n\"Look! Oh, look! Isn\\'t it like the sun?\"\\n\\nHe eyed it critically.\\n\\n\"By Jove! It must have cost cool hundreds! I\\'ll take it to town\\nto-morrow and bring back the things you need. It will get the\\nbaby clothes, too, so you won\\'t have to bother about the sewing.\"\\n\\n\"You shan\\'t! You shan\\'t!\" cried Molly in a passion of sobs. \"It\\'s\\nmine. She gave it to me, and you shan\\'t take it away. I don\\'t\\nwant the medicine: it never does me any good; and I can make the\\nbaby clothes out of my old things. I\\'ll never, never give it up!\"\\n\\nFor an instant Will stared at her as if she had lost her senses.\\n\\n\"Well, she was a fool to let you get it,\" he said, as he flung\\nhimself out of the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. In Which Mrs. Blake\\'s Eyes are Opened\\n\\nBefore the beauty of Maria\\'s high magnanimity Christopher had\\nfelt himself thrust further into the abasement of his\\nself-contempt. Had she met his confession with reproach, with\\nrighteous aversion, with the horror he had half expected, it is\\npossible that his heart might have recoiled into a last\\nexpression of defiance. But there had been none of these things.\\nIn his memory her face shone moonlike from its cloud of dark\\nhair, and he saw upon it only the look of a great and sorrowful\\npassion. His wretchedness had drawn her closer, not put her\\nfurther away, and he had felt the quiet of her tolerance not less\\ngratefully than he had felt the fervour of her love. Her\\nforgiveness had been of the grandeur of her own nature, and its\\nheight and breadth had appealed, even apart from her emotion, to\\na mind that was accustomed to dwell daily on long reaches of\\nunbroken space. He had been bred on large things from his\\nbirth--large horizons, large stretches of field and sky, large\\nimpulses, and large powers of hating, and he found now that a\\nwoman\\'s presence filled to overflowing the empty vastness of his\\nmoods.\\n\\nReaching the yard, he saw Tucker sitting placidly on his bench,\\nand, crossing the long grass, he flung himself down beside him\\nwith a sigh of pleasure in the beauty of the scene.\\n\\n\"You\\'re right, Uncle Tucker; it\\'s all wonderful. I never saw such\\na sunset in my life.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but you haven\\'t seen it yet,\" said Tucker. \"I\\'ve been\\nlooking at it since it first caught that pile of clouds, and it\\ngrows more splendid every instant. I\\'m not an overreligious body,\\nI reckon, and I\\'ve always held that the best compliment you can\\npay God Almighty is to let Him go His own gait and quit advising\\nHim; but, I declare, as I sat here just now I couldn\\'t help being\\nimpertinent enough to pray that I might live to see another.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a first-rate one; that\\'s so. It seems to shake a body\\nout of the muck, somehow.\"\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t wonder if it did; and that\\'s what I told two young\\nfools who were up here just now asking me to patch up their first\\nmarried quarrel. \\'For heaven\\'s sake, stop playing with mud and\\nsit down and watch that sunset,\\' I said to \\'em, and if you\\'ll\\nbelieve it, the girl actually dropped her jaws and replied she\\nhad to hurry back to shell her beans while the light lasted.\\nBeans! Why, they\\'ll make beans enough of their marriage, and so I\\ntold \\'em.\"\\n\\nTapping his crutch gently on the ground, he paused and sat\\nsmiling broadly at the sunset.\\n\\nFor a time Christopher watched with him while the gold-\\nand-crimson glory flamed beyond the twisted boughs of the old\\npine; then, turning his troubled face on Tucker\\'s cheerful one,\\nhe asked deliberately:\\n\\n\"Do you sometimes regret that you never married, Uncle Tucker?\"\\n\\n\"Regret?\" repeated Tucker softly. \"Why, no. I haven\\'t time for\\nit--there\\'s too much else to think about. Regret is a dangerous\\nthing, my boy; you let a little one no bigger than a mustard seed\\ninto your heart, and before you know it you\\'ve hatched out a\\nwhole brood. Why, if I began to regret that, heaven knows where I\\nshould stop. I\\'d regret my leg and arm next, the pictures I might\\nhave painted, and the four years\\' war which we might have won.\\nNo, no. I\\'d change nothing, I tell you--not a day; not an hour;\\nnot a single sin nor a single virtue. They\\'re all woven into the\\npattern of the whole, and I reckon the Lord knew the figure He\\nhad in mind.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'d like to pull a thread or two out of it,\" returned\\nChristopher moodily, squinting his eyes at the approaching form\\nof Susan Spade, who came from the afterglow through the\\nwhitewashed gate. \"Why, what\\'s bringing her, I wonder?\" he asked\\nwith evident displeasure.\\n\\nTo this inquiry Susan herself presently made answer as she walked\\nwith her determined tread across the little yard.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve a bit of news for you, Mr. Christopher, an\\' I reckon you\\'d\\nruther have it from my mouth than from Bill Fletcher\\'s. His\\nback\\'s up agin, the Lord knows why, an\\' he\\'s gone an\\' moved his\\npasture fence so as to take in yo\\' old field that lies beside it.\\nHe swars it\\'s his, too, but Tom\\'s ready to match him with a\\nbigger oath that it\\'s yours an\\' always has been.\"\\n\\n\"Of course it\\'s mine,\" said Christopher coolly. \"The meadow brook\\nmarks the boundary, and the field is on this side. I can prove it\\nby Tom or Jacob Weatherby tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he\\'s took it \" rejoined Mrs. Spade flatly.\\n\\n\"He won\\'t keep it long, I reckon, ma\\'am,\" said Tucker, in his\\npleasant manner; \"and I must say it seems to me that Bill\\nFletcher is straining at a gnat. Why, he has near two thousand\\nacres, hasn\\'t he? And what under heaven does he want with that\\nold field the sheep have nibbled bare? There\\'s no sense in it.\"\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t sense, it\\'s nature,\" returned Mrs. Spade, sitting\\nsquarely down on the bench from which Christopher had risen; \"an\\'\\nthat\\'s what I\\'ve had ag\\'in men folks from the start--thar\\'s too\\nmuch natur in \\'em. You kin skeer it out of a woman, an\\' you kin\\nbeat it out of a dog, an\\' thar\\'re times when you kin even spank\\nit out of a baby, but if you oust it from a man thar ain\\'t\\nnothin\\' but skin an\\' bones left behind. An\\' natur\\'s a ticklish\\nthing to handle without gloves, bless yo\\' soul, suh. It\\'s like a\\nhive of bees: you give it a little poke to start it, an\\' the\\nfirst thing you know it\\'s swarmin\\' all over both yo\\' hands. It\\'s\\na skeery thing, suh, an\\' Bill Fletcher\\'s got his share of it,\\nsho\\'s you\\'re born.\"\\n\\n\"It has its way with him pretty thoroughly, I think,\" responded\\nTucker, chuckling; \"but if I were you, Christopher, I\\'d stick up\\nfor my rights in that old field. Bill Fletcher may need exercise,\\nbut there\\'s no reason he should get it by trampling over you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll throw his fence down, never fear,\" answered Christopher\\nindifferently. \"He knew it, I dare say, when he put it up.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fuss he wants, suh, an\\' nothing else,\" declared Mrs.\\nSpade, smoothing down the starched fold of her gingham apron;\\n\"an\\' if he doesn\\'t git it, po\\' creetur, he\\'s goin\\' to be laid up\\nin bed befo\\' the week is out. He\\'s bilin\\' hot inside, I can see\\nthat in his face, an\\' if the steam don\\'t work out one way it will\\nanother. When a man ain\\'t got a wife or child to nag at he\\'s\\nmighty sho\\' to turn right round an\\' begin naggin\\' at his\\nneighbours, an\\' that\\'s why it\\'s the bounden duty of every decent\\nwoman to marry an\\' save the peace. Why, if Tom hadn\\'t had me to\\nworry on, I reckon he\\'d be the biggest blusterer in this county\\nor the next.\"\\n\\nLeaving her still talking, Christopher went from her into the\\nhouse, where he lingered an instant with drawn breath before his\\nmother\\'s door. The old lady was sleeping tranquilly, and,\\ntreading softly in his heavy boots, he passed out to the friendly\\nfaces of the horses and the cool dusk of the stable.\\n\\nAs the days went on, drawing gradually toward summer, Mrs.\\nBlake\\'s life began peacefully to flicker out, like a candle that\\nhas burned into the socket. There were hours when her mind was\\nquite clear, and at such times she would talk unceasingly in her\\nold sprightly fashion, with her animated gestures and her arch\\nand fascinating smile. But following these sanguine periods there\\nwould come whole days when she lay unconscious and barely taking\\nbreath, while her features grew sharp and wan under the pallid\\nskin.\\n\\nIt was when she had just passed through one of these states that\\nLila came out on a Sunday afternoon to find Christopher at the\\nwoodpile, and told him, with a burst of tears, that she thought\\nthe end had come.\\n\\n\"She\\'s quite herself and wants us all,\" she said, sobbing. \"And\\nshe\\'s even asked for the house servants, every one--for Phyllis,\\nand Tobias, and so many of them who have been away for years.\\nIt\\'s just as if she knew that she was dying and wanted to say\\ngood-by.\"\\n\\nThrowing the axe hurriedly aside, Christopher followed her into\\nthe house, and then entering the old lady\\'s room, stopped short\\nbeside the threshold in a grief that was not unmixed with wonder.\\n\\nThe sunshine fell straight through the window on the high white\\npillows, and among them Mrs. Blake was sitting rigidly, her blind\\neyes sparkling with the last fitful return of her intelligence.\\nShe was speaking, as he entered, in a natural and lively tone,\\nwhich brought back to him his earliest memories of her engaging\\nbrightness.\\n\\n\"Are the servants all there, Cynthia? Then let them come and\\nstand inside the door--a few at a time.\"\\n\\n\"They are here, mother,\" replied Cynthia, choking; and\\nChristopher, glancing round, saw several decrepit Negroes leaning\\nagainst the wall--Uncle Boaz, Docia (pressing her weak heart),\\nand blear-eyed Aunt Polly, already in her dotage.\\n\\n\"I wish to tell you good-by while my mind is clear,\" pursued the\\nold lady in her high, sweet voice. \"You have been good servants\\nto me for a long time, and I hope you will live many years to\\nserve my children as faithfully. Always remember, Christopher--is\\nChristopher there?\"\\n\\n\"I am here, dear mother.\"\\n\\n\"Always remember that a man\\'s first duty is to his wife and\\nchildren, and his second to his slaves. The Lord has placed them\\nin your hands, and you must answer to Him how you fulfill the\\ntrust. And now, Boaz--where is Boaz?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m yer, ole miss; I\\'m right yer.\"\\n\\n\"You may shake my hand, Boaz, for it is a long good-by. I\\'ve\\nalways promised you your freedom, and I haven\\'t forgotten it,\\nthough you asked for it almost fifty years ago. You did something\\nthat I praised you for--I can\\'t quite remember what it was--and\\nwhen I asked you what you would like as a reward, you answered:\\n\\'Don\\'t give me nothin\\' now, ole miss, but let the gift grow and\\nset me free when you come to die.\\' It is a long time, Boaz, fifty\\nyears, but I give you your freedom now, as I promised, though it\\nis very foolish of you to want it, and I\\'m sure you\\'ll find it\\nnothing but a burden and a trouble. Christopher, will you\\nremember that Boaz is free?\"\\n\\nChristopher crossed the room, and, catching her hands in his own,\\nsought to force her back upon the pillows, but with an effort\\nthat showed in every tense line of her face she pushed him from\\nher and sat erect and unsupported.\\n\\n\"Let me dismiss them first,\" she said with her stately manner.\\n\"Good-by, Phyllis and Polly--and--and--all the rest of you. You\\nmay go now. I am a little tired, and I will lie down.\"\\n\\nCynthia put the weeping servants from the room, and, filling a\\nglass with brandy, held it with a shaking hand to her mother\\'s\\nlips.\\n\\n\"Take this, dear, and lie down,\" she said.\\n\\nMrs. Blake sipped the brandy obediently, but as she felt her\\nstrength revive from the strong spirit the animation reawoke in\\nher face, and, turning toward Christopher, she stretched out her\\nhand with an appealing gesture.\\n\\n\"There is so much to say and I haven\\'t the space to say it in, my\\nson. There is so much advice I want to give you, but the time is\\nshort.\"\\n\\n\"I understand, mother; I understand. Don\\'t let it trouble you.\"\\n\\n\"I have had a fortunate life, my child,\" resumed the old lady,\\nwaving him to silence with a gesture in which there was still a\\nfeeble sprightliness, \"and when one has lived happily far into\\nthe seventies one learns a great deal of wisdom, and there is\\nmuch good advice that one ought to leave behind. You have been an\\naffectionate son to me, Christopher, and I have not yet given up\\nthe hope that you may live to be a worthy husband to another\\nwoman. If you do marry--and God grant that you may--remember that\\nthe chief consideration should be family connection, and the next\\npersonal attractiveness. Wealth counts for very little beside\\ngood birth, and after this I regard a small foot and hand as most\\nessential. They have always been a mark of our breeding,\\nChristopher, and I should not like the family to lose through you\\none of its most distinguished characteristics.\"\\n\\n\"It is not likely I shall marry, mother. I was cut out for\\ndifferent ends.\"\\n\\n\"One never knows, my son, and at least I am only doing my duty in\\nspeaking to you thus. I am a very old woman, and I am not afraid\\nto die, for I have never to my knowledge done anything that was\\nunbecoming in a lady. Remember to be a gentleman, and you will\\nfind that that embraces all morality and a good deal of\\nreligion.\"\\n\\nHe kissed her hand, watching anxiously the mounting excitement in\\nher face.\\n\\n\"And if you do marry, Christopher,\" she went on, harping fitfully\\non her favourite string, \"remember that keeping in love is as\\nmuch the profession for a man as it is the art for a woman, and\\nthat love feeds on little delicacies rather than on meat and\\ndrink. Don\\'t forget the little things, dear, and the big ones\\nwill take care of themselves. I have seen much of men and manners\\nin my life, and they have taught me that it is the small\\nfailings, not the big faults, which are deadliest to love. Why,\\nI\\'ve seen a romantic passion survive shame, and treachery, and\\neven blows, and another wither out of existence before the first\\ntouch of bad breeding. \\'A man\\'s table manners are a part of his\\nmorality,\\' your Great-grandfather Bolivar used to say.\"\\n\\nShe laughed softly while her hand played with the white fringe on\\nthe counterpane.\\n\\n\"I can recall now the sympathy I felt for Matty Gordon,\" she\\npursued, \"a great belle and beauty who ran off and married that\\nscamp, Aleck Douglas. He turned into a perfect rascal, they said,\\nthough I must admit that he made a very amiable husband, and\\nnever stinted her, even if he stole from other people. Well, she\\nstuck to him through good and evil report, and was really from\\nall appearances a most contented woman. When he died at last,\\npeople said that it was just in time to escape the penitentiary,\\nbut to see Matty you would have thought she had lost nothing\\nshort of pure perfection. Poor old Bishop Deane, who always would\\nspeak his mind, in the pulpit or out of it, went to call on her,\\nhe told me, and took occasion to reprove her for such excessive\\ngrief over so unworthy an object. \\'He was not an upright man,\\nMatty, and you know it,\\' he began quite boldly; \\'he was a\\nlibertine, and a gambler, and an open scoffer at religion.\\' But\\nMatty went on sobbing harder than ever, and at last, getting\\nangry, he said sternly: \\'And more than this, ma\\'am, he was, as\\nyou know, a faithless and disloyal husband!\\' Then the poor girl\\ndrew out a pocket handkerchief with a three-inch black border and\\nmopped her pretty blue eyes. \\'Ah, but, Bishop, I had so much to\\nbe thankful for!\\' she said. \\'He never chewed tobacco!\\' Well,\\nwell, she may have been a fool, as the Bishop insisted, but he\\nwas a man, in spite of his cloth, and could never learn to\\nunderstand a woman\\'s sensibilities.\"\\n\\nShe finished, and, turning, touched him gently on the hand.\\n\\n\"It is the little things that count in marriage, Christopher,\"\\nand after a moment she added thoughtfully: \"Promise me that you\\nwill always use an ash-tray.\"\\n\\n\"Anything, dear mother; I promise anything.\"\\n\\nWith a contented sigh she closed her eyes, and, still holding his\\nhand, fell into a broken and troubled sleep, from which she awoke\\npresently in a gentle delirium. Her lost youth had returned to\\nher, and with it something of her old gaiety of manner. Suddenly\\nhe felt a strange thrill pass through her, and raising herself\\nwith a last great endeavour, she sat erect, staring into the blue\\nsky that showed through the window.\\n\\n\"I am engaged for this set, sir,\" she said in her winning voice,\\nwhile a girlish smile transfigured her wan face, \"but if it\\npleases you, you may put your name down for the next.\"\\n\\nRising, he bent quickly over her, but before he touched her she\\nhad fallen back upon the pillows and lay with her arch smile\\nfrozen upon her face.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. Christopher Plants by Moonlight\\n\\nAt midnight they left him to watch alone in her chamber, and\\nwhile he sat in the shadow beside the tester bed his thoughts\\nencircled the still form on the white counterpane. On the mantel\\ntwo candles burned dimly, and the melted tallow dripped slowly\\ndown into the tall brass candlesticks. The dimity curtains of the\\nbed fluttered softly in the breeze that blew through the open\\nwindow, and in his nostrils there was the scent of the single\\nrose standing in a glass vase upon the table. Tucker had brought\\nher the rose that morning and she had held it for a pleased\\nmoment in her trembling fingers. Everything in the room around\\nhim was ready for her use--her nightcap lay on the bureau, and in\\nthe china tray beside it he saw her brush and comb, in which a\\nlong strand of white hair was still twisted. On her hands, folded\\nquietly upon her breast, he caught the flash of Docia\\'s piece of\\npurple glass, and he remembered with a throb of pain that she had\\nasked that her betrothal ring might be buried with her.\\n\\n\"Well, she knows all now,\" he thought in bitterness. \"She knows\\nthe theft of the diamond, and the deception that lasted nearly\\nthirty years.\" In the midst of his sorrow a sudden shame\\npossessed him, and he felt all at once that his heart was pierced\\nby the unearthly keenness of the dead eyes. \"She knows all now,\"\\nhe repeated, and there was a passionate defiance in his\\nacknowledgment. \"She knows all that I have hidden from her, as\\nwell as much that has been hidden from me. Her blind eyes are\\nopen, and she sees at last my failure and my sin, and the agony\\nthat I have known. For years I have shielded her, but she cannot\\nshield me now, for all her wider vision. She can avert my fate no\\nmore than I could hold her back from hers. We are each\\nalone--she, and I, and Maria, and the boy whom I have ruined--and\\nthere is no love that can keep a man from living and dying to\\nhimself.\"\\n\\nIt seemed to him, sitting there in the shadow, that he felt as he\\nhad felt before in grave moments--the revolutions of the wheel on\\nwhich he was bound. And with that strange mystic insight which\\ncomes to those who lead brooding and isolated lives close to\\nNature, he asked himself if, after all, these things had not had\\ntheir beginning in the dawn of his existence so many million\\nyears ago. \"Has it not all happened before as it happens now--my\\nshame and my degradation, the kiss I placed on Maria\\'s lips, and\\nthe watch I keep by the deathbed of my mother? It is all familiar\\nto me, and when the end comes, that will be familiar, too.\"\\n\\nA night moth entered, wheeling in dizzy circles about the candle,\\nbut when it went so near as to scorch its wings he caught it\\ngently in his hollowed palms and released it into the darkness of\\nthe yard. As he leaned out he saw the light shining clear in\\nMaria\\'s window, and while he gazed upon it he felt a curious\\nkinship with the moth that had flown in from the night and\\nhovered about the flame.\\n\\nAs the days went on, the emptiness in the house became to him\\nlike that of the grave, and he learned presently that the peevish\\nand exacting old lady who had not stirred for years from her\\nsick-bed had left a vacancy larger than all the rest of them\\ncould fill. Cynthia, who had borne most of the burden, began now\\nto bear, in its place, the heavier share of the loss. Released\\nfrom her daily sacrifice and her patient drudgery, she looked\\nabout her with dazed eyes, like one whose future has been\\nsuddenly swept away. There was nothing for her to do any longer\\n--no risings in the gray dawn to prepare the day\\'s stealthy work,\\nno running on aching feet to answer unreasonable complaints, no\\nnumberless small lies to plan in secret, no stinting of herself\\nthat her mother might have her little luxuries. Her work was\\nover, and she pined away in the first freedom of her life. The\\nvery fact that deception was no longer necessary seemed to sweep\\nher accustomed moorings from beneath her feet. She had lied so\\nlong that lying had become at last a second nature to her, and to\\nher surprise she found almost an indecency in the aspect of the\\nnaked truth.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how it is, Uncle Tucker,\" she said one day toward\\nthe end of June, when the deadly drought which had kept back the\\ntransplanting of the tobacco had ended in three days of heavy\\nrain--\"I don\\'t know how it is, but the thing I miss most--and I\\nmiss her every minute--is the lying I had to do. It gave me\\nsomething to think about, somehow. I used to stay awake at night\\nand plan all sorts of pleasant lies that I could tell about the\\nhouse and the garden, and the way the war ended, and the\\nPresidents of the Confederacy--I made up all their names--and the\\nfuss with which each one was inaugurated, and the dresses their\\nwives and daughters wore. It\\'s all so dull when you have to stop\\npretending and begin to face things just as they are. I\\'ve lied\\nfor almost thirty years, and I reckon I\\'ve lost my taste for the\\ntruth.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it will come back, dear,\" responded Tucker reassuringly;\\n\"but I think you need a change if a woman ever did. What about\\nthat week you\\'re to spend with the Weatherbys?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to-morrow,\" answered Cynthia shortly. \"Lila is sick\\nwith a cold and wants me; but how you and Christopher will manage\\nto get on is more than I can say.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we\\'ll worry along with Docia, never fear,\" replied Tucker,\\nhobbling into his seat at the supper table, as Christopher came\\nin from the woods with the heavy moisture dripping from his\\nclothes.\\n\\n\"It\\'s cleared off fine and there\\'s to be a full moon tonight,\"\\nsaid the young man, hanging up his hat. \"If the rain had come a\\nweek later the tobacco would have been ruined. I\\'ve just been\\ntaking it up out of the plant-bed.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll begin setting it out to-morrow, I reckon, then,\" observed\\nTucker, watching Cynthia as she cut up his food.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m afraid to wait--the ground dries so quickly. Jacob\\nWeatherby is going to set his out to-night, and I think I\\'ll do\\nthe same. There\\'s a fine moon, and I shouldn\\'t wonder if every\\nfarmer in the county was in the fields till daybreak.\"\\n\\nHe ate his supper hurriedly, and then, taking down his hat, went\\nout to resume his work. At the door he had left his big split\\nbasket of plants, and, slipping his arm through the handle, he\\ncrossed the yard in the direction of the field. As he turned into\\nthe little path which trailed in wet grass along the \"worm\"\\nfence, Jacob Weatherby came stepping briskly through the mud in\\nthe road and stopped to ask him if he had got his ground ready\\nfor the setting out. \"I\\'ve been lookin\\' for hands myself,\" added\\nthe old man in his cheery voice, \"for I could find work for a\\ndozen men to-night, but to save my life I can\\'t scrape up more\\'n\\na nigger here an\\' thar. Bill Fletcher has been out ahead of me,\\nit seems.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll be able to help you to-morrow, I think,\" answered\\nChristopher. \"I hope to get my own work done to-night.\" Then he\\nasked. with a trifling hesitation: \"How is Lila\\'s cold?\"\\n\\nA sudden light broke over old Jacob\\'s face, and he nodded in his\\ngenial fashion.\\n\\n\"Ah, bless her pretty eyes, I sometimes think she\\'s too good to\\nput her foot down on this here common earth,\" he said, \"an\\' to\\nthink that only this mornin\\' she was wantin\\' to help Sarah wipe\\nthe dishes. Why, I reckon Sarah would ruther work her fingers to\\nthe bone than have that gal take a single dishcloth in her hand.\\nOh, we know how to value her, Mr. Christopher, never fear. Her\\nword\\'s law in our house, and always will be.\"\\n\\nHe passed on with his hearty chuckle, and Christopher followed\\nthe wet path and began planting his tobacco plants in the small\\nholes he bored in the moist earth.\\n\\nIt was the most solemn hour of day, when the division between\\nlight and darkness seems less a gradation than a sudden blur. A\\nfaint yellow line still lingered across the western horizon, and\\nagainst it the belt of pines rose like an advancing army. The\\nwind, which blew toward him from the woods, filled his nostrils\\nwith a spicy tang.\\n\\nSlowly the moon rose higher, flooding the hollows and the low\\ngreen hills with light. In the outlying fields around the Hall he\\nsaw Fletcher\\'s planters at work in the tobacco, each man so\\nclosely followed by his shadow that it was impossible at a little\\ndistance to distinguish the living labourer from his airy double.\\nAll the harsh irregularities of the landscape were submerged in a\\ngeneral softness of tone, and the shapes of hill and meadow, of\\nroad and tree, of shrub and rock, were dissolved in a magical and\\nenchanting beauty.\\n\\nSeveral hours had passed, and he had stopped to rest a moment\\nfrom his planting, when Maria came in the moonlight along the\\nroad and paused breathlessly to lean upon the fence beneath the\\nlocust tree.\\n\\n\"It is the first time I\\'ve been out for two weeks,\" she said,\\npanting softly. \"I twisted my ankle, and the worst part was that\\nI didn\\'t even dare to send you word. What must you have thought?\"\\n\\n\"No harm of you,\" he answered, and threw down the fence-rails\\nthat she might cross. \"Come over to me, Maria.\"\\n\\nPutting her hands in his, she passed over the lowered fence, and\\nthen stood at arm\\'s length looking into his face, which the\\nmoonlight had softened to a beauty that brought to her mind a\\ncarving in old ivory.\\n\\n\"I still limp a little,\" she went on, smiling, \"and I had to\\nsteal out like a thief and run through the shadows. To find me\\nwith you would be the death of grandfather, I believe. Something\\nhas occurred to put him in a fresh rage with you.\"\\n\\n\"It was the field by the pasture,\" he told her frankly. \"You know\\nit belongs to me, and pure justice made me throw down his fence;\\nbut if you wish it I will put it up again. I\\'ll do anything you\\nwish.\"\\n\\nShe thought for a moment with that complete detachment of\\njudgment from emotion which is so rarely a part of a woman\\'s\\nintellect.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" she said; \"it is right that you should take it down. I\\nwould not have you submit to any further injustice, not even a\\nlittle one like that.\"\\n\\n\"And this will go on forever! Oh, Maria, how will it end?\"\\n\\n\"We must wait and hope, dear; you see that.\"\\n\\n\"I see nothing but that I love you and am most miserable,\" he\\nanswered desperately.\\n\\nA smile curved her lips. \"Oh, blind and faithless, I see only\\nyou!\"\\n\\nHe was still holding her hands, but, dropping them as she spoke,\\nhe threw his arms wide open and stood waiting.\\n\\n\"Then come to me, my dearest; come to me.\"\\n\\nHis voice rang out in command rather than entreaty, and he stood\\nsmiling gravely as, hesitating a breathless instant, she regarded\\nhim with eyes that struggled to be calm. Then slowly the radiance\\nwhich was less the warmth of colour than of expression flooded\\nher face, and she bent toward him as if impelled by some strong\\noutside force. The next moment the storm swept her roughly from\\nher feet and crushed back her pleading hands upon her bosom;\\nbewildered, flushed, and trembling, she lay upon his breast while\\ntheir lips clung together. \"Oh, my friend, my lover,\" she\\nmurmured faintly.\\n\\nHe felt her resistance dissolve within his arms, and it was a\\npart of the tragedy of their love that there should come to him\\nno surprise when he found her mouth salt from her tears. The\\nshadow of a great evil, of a secret anguish, still divided them,\\nand it was this that gave to their embraces the sorrowful passion\\nwhich he drew from her despairing kiss.\\n\\n\"You cannot love me, Maria. How can it be true?\"\\n\\nReleasing herself, she put her hand upon his lips to silence him.\\n\\n\"You have made your confession,\" she said earnestly, with the\\nserene dignity which had impressed him in the first moment of\\ntheir meeting, \"and now I will make mine. You must not stop me;\\nyou must not look at me until I finish. Promise.\"\\n\\n\"I promise to keep silent,\" he answered, with his gaze upon her.\\n\\nShe drew away from him, keeping her eyes full on his, and holding\\nhim at arm\\'s length with the tips of her fingers. He felt that\\nshe was still shaken by his embrace--that she was still in a\\nquiver from his kisses; but to all outward seeming she had\\nregained the noble composure of her bearing.\\n\\n\"No, no. Ah, listen, my friend, and do not touch me. What I must\\ntell you is this, and you must hear me patiently to the end. I\\nhave loved you always--from the first day; since the beginning.\\nThere has never been any one else, and there has never been a\\nmoment in my life when I would not have followed you had you\\nlifted a finger anywhere. At first I did not know--I did not\\nbelieve it. It was but a passing fancy, I thought, that you had\\nmurdered. I taught myself to believe that I was cold, inhuman,\\nbecause I did not warm to other men. Oh, I did not know then that\\nI was not stone, but ice, which would melt at the first touch of\\nthe true flame .\"\\n\\n\"Maria!\" he burst out in a cry of anguish.\\n\\n\"Hush! Hush! Remember your promise. It was not until afterward,\"\\nshe went on in the same quiet voice; \"it was not until my\\nmarriage--not until my soul shuddered back from his embraces and\\nI dreamed of you, that I began to see--to understand.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Maria, my beloved, if I had known!\"\\n\\nShe still held him from her with her outstretched arm.\\n\\n\"It was the knowledge of this that made me feel that I had\\nwronged him--that I had defrauded him of the soul of love and\\ngiven him only the poor flesh. It was this that held me to him\\nall those wretched years--that kept me with him till the end,\\neven through his madness. At last I buried your memory, told\\nmyself that I had forgotten.\"\\n\\n\"We will let the world go, dearest,\" he said passionately. \"Come\\nto me.\"\\n\\nBut she shook her head, and, still smiling, held him at a\\ndistance.\\n\\n\"It will never go,\" she answered, \"for it is not the world\\'s way.\\nBut whatever comes to us, there is one thing you must\\nremember--that you must never forget for one instant while you\\nlive. In good or evil, in life or death, there is no height so\\nhigh nor any depth so low that I will not follow you.\"\\n\\nThen waving him from her with a decisive gesture, she turned from\\nhim and went swiftly home across the moonlit fields.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. Treats of the Tragedy Which Wears a Comic Mask\\n\\nAs she hastened on, Christopher\\'s presence was still with\\nher--his arm still enveloped her, his voice still spoke in her\\nears; and so rapt was the ecstasy in which she moved that it was\\nwith a positive shock that she found herself presently before the\\nlittle area which led into the brick kitchen in the basement of\\nthe Hall. Here from the darkness her name was spoken in a stifled\\nvoice, while a hand reached out and clutched her by the shoulder.\\n\\n\"I say, Maria, I\\'ve been waiting hours to speak to you.\"\\n\\nForcing back the cry upon her lips, she opened the door and stole\\nsoftly into the kitchen. Then, turning, she faced Will with a\\nfrightened gesture.\\n\\n\"How reckless--how very reckless!\" she exclaimed in a whisper.\\n\\nHe closed the door that led up into the house, and coming over to\\nthe stove, where the remains of a fire still smouldered in a deep\\nred glow, stood looking at her with nervous twitches of his\\nreddened eyelids. There was a wildness in his face before which\\nshe fell back appalled, and his whole appearance, from the damp\\nhair lying in streaks upon his forehead to his restless feet\\nwhich he shuffled continually as he talked, betrayed an agitation\\nso extreme as to cause her a renewed pang of foreboding.\\n\\n\"Oh, Will, you have been drinking again!\" she said, in the same\\nfrightened whisper.\\n\\n\"And why not?\" he demanded, throwing out his words between thick\\nbreaths. \"What business is it of yours or of anybody else\\'s if I\\nhave been? A pretty sister you are--aren\\'t you?--to let a fellow\\nrot away on a tobacco farm while you wear diamonds on your\\nfingers.\"\\n\\nShe looked at him steadily for a moment, and his shifting glance\\nfell slowly to the floor.\\n\\n\"If you are in any fresh trouble you may as well tell me at\\nonce,\" she said. \"It is a mere waste of time and breath to\\nreproach me. You can\\'t possibly make me angry to-night, for I\\nwear an armour of which you do not dream, and so little a thing\\nas abuse does not even touch me. Besides, grandfather may hear us\\nand come down at any moment. So speak quickly.\"\\n\\nHer coolness sobered him instantly, as if a splash of icewater\\nhad been thrown into his face, and his tone lost its\\naggressiveness and sank into a whimpering complaint.\\n\\nIt was the same old thing, he went on, only worse and worse.\\nMolly had been ill again, and the doctor ordered medicine he\\ncouldn\\'t buy. Yes, he had tried to take the diamond from her, but\\nshe flew into hysterics at the mere mention of selling it. Once\\nhe had dragged it off her finger, and had given it back again\\nbecause her wildness frightened him, \"Why on earth did you ever\\nlet her have it?\" he finished querulously.\\n\\n\"Well, I never imagined she would be quite so silly,\" returned\\nMaria, distressed by what she heard. \"But it may be that jewels\\nare really her passion, and the bravest of us, I suppose, are\\nthose who sacrifice most for their dearest desire. I really don\\'t\\nsee what is to be done, Will. I haven\\'t any money, and I don\\'t\\ndare ask grandfather, for he makes me keep a strict account of\\nevery cent I spend. Only yesterday he told me he couldn\\'t allow\\nme but two postage stamps a week, and yet I believe that he is\\nworth considerably more than half a million dollars. Sometimes I\\nthink it is nothing short of pure insanity, he grows so miserly\\nabout little things. Aunt Saidie and I have both noticed that he\\nwould rather spend a hundred dollars--though it is like drawing\\nout an eyetooth--than keep a pound of fresh butter from the\\nmarket.\"\\n\\n\"And yet he likes you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he tolerates me, as far as that goes; but I don\\'t believe he\\nlikes anything on earth except his money. It\\'s his great passion,\\njust as Molly\\'s love of jewelry is hers. There is something so\\ntremendous about it that one can\\'t help respect it. As for me, he\\nonly bears with my presence so long as I ask him for absolutely\\nnothing. He knows I have my little property, and we had a\\ndreadful scene when I refused to let him keep my check-book. I\\ngave you all the interest of the last six months, you know, and\\nthe other isn\\'t due until November. If he finds out that it goes\\nto you, heaven help us!\"\\n\\n\"And there\\'s not the faintest hope of his coming to his senses?\\nHave you spoken of me again?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve mentioned your name twice, that was all. He rose and\\nstamped out of the room, and didn\\'t speak for days. Aunt Saidie\\nand I have planned to bring the baby over when it comes. That may\\nsoften him--especially if it should be a boy.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, the bottom will drop out of things by that time,\" he\\nreturned savagely, tearing pieces of straw from his worn\\nhat-brim. \"If this keeps up much longer, Maria, I warn you now\\nI\\'ll run away. I\\'ll go off some day on a freight train and hide\\nmy head until he dies; then I\\'ll come back to enjoy his precious\\nmoney.\"\\n\\nShe sighed, thinking hopelessly of the altered will.\\n\\n\"And Molly?\" she questioned, for lack of a more effectual\\nargument.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t stop to think of Molly: it drives me mad. What use am I\\nto her, anyway, I\\'d like to know? She\\'d be quite as well off\\nwithout me, for we do nothing but quarrel now night and day; and\\nyet I love her--I love her awfully,\" he added in a drunken\\nwhimper.\\n\\n\"Oh, Will, Will, be a man for her sake!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t; I can\\'t,\" he protested, his voice rising in anger. \"I\\ncan\\'t stand the squalor of this life; it\\'s killing me. Why, look\\nat the way I was brought up, never stopping an instant to ask\\nwhether I could have a thing I wanted. He had no right to\\naccustom me to luxuries till I couldn\\'t do without them and then\\nthrow me out upon the world like this!\"\\n\\n\"Hush! Hush! Your voice is too loud. It will bring him down.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be hanged if I care!\" he retorted, but involuntarily he\\nlowered his tone.\\n\\n\"You mustn\\'t stay here five minutes longer,\" urged Maria. \"I\\'ll\\ngive you a diamond brooch I still have left, and you may take it\\nto town yourself and sell it. Only promise me on your honour that\\nyou will spend the money on the things Molly needs.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I promise,\" he replied roughly. \"Where is it?\"\\n\\n\"In my room. I must get it now. Be perfectly quiet until I\\nreturn.\"\\n\\nOpening the door and closing it carefully behind her, she stole\\nnoiselessly up the dark staircase, while Will, twitching\\nnervously, paced restlessly up and down the brick floor. A pile\\nof walnuts which Miss Saidie had been shelling for cake lay on\\nthe hearth, and, picking up the heavy old hammer she had used, he\\ncracked a nut and ate it hurriedly. Hungry as he was--for he had\\nnot been home to supper--he found difficulty in swallowing, and,\\nlaying the hammer down upon the bricks, he rose and stood waiting\\nbeside the stove. Though the night was warm, a shiver ran\\nsuddenly through him, and, stirring the fading embers with a\\nsplinter of resinous pine, he held out his shaking hands to the\\nblaze.\\n\\nIn a moment Maria entered and handed him the brooch in a little\\nbox.\\n\\n\"Try to keep up courage, Will,\" she said, pushing him into the\\narea under the back steps; \"and above all things, do not come\\nhere again. It is so unsafe.\"\\n\\nHe promised lightly that he would not, and then told her good-by\\nwith an affectionate pat upon the arm.\\n\\n\"Well, you are a bully good chap, after all,\" he added, as he\\nstepped out into the night.\\n\\nFor a while Maria stood looking after him across the moonlit\\nfields, and then, even as she turned to enter the house, the last\\ntroubled hour was blotted from her consciousness, and she lived\\nover again the moment of Christopher\\'s embrace. With that\\npeculiar power to revive and hold within the memory an instant\\'s\\nemotion which is possessed by ardent and imaginative women, she\\nexperienced again all the throbbing exhilaration, all the fulness\\nof being, which had seemed to crowd the heartbeats of so many\\nordinary years into the single minute that was packed with life.\\nThat minute was hers now for all time; it was a possession of\\nwhich no material loss, no untoward fate could defraud her; and\\nas she felt her steps softly up the dark staircase, it seemed to\\nher that she saw her way by the light of the lamp that was\\nburning in her bosom.\\n\\nTo her surprise, as she reached the dining-room a candle was\\nthrust out before her, and, illuminated by the trembling flame,\\nshe saw the face of Fletcher, hairy, bloated, sinister, with the\\nshadow of evil impulses worked into the mouth and eyes. For a\\nmoment he wagged at her in silence, and in the flickering\\nradiance she saw each swollen vein, each gloomy furrow, with\\nexaggerated distinctness. He reminded her vaguely of some hideous\\ngargoyle she had seen hanging from an early Gothic cathedral.\\n\\n\"So you\\'ve taken to gallivanting, like the rest,\" he observed\\nwith coarse pleasantry. \"I\\'d thought you were a staid and\\nsober-minded woman for your years, but it seems that you are of a\\nbunch with all the others.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been out in the moonlight,\" answered Maria, while a\\nsensation of sickness stole over her.\\n\\n\"It is as bright as day, but I thought you were in bed long ago.\"\\n\\n\"Thar\\'s not much sleep for me during tobacco planting, I kin tell\\nyou,\" rejoined Fletcher; \"but as for you, I reckon thar\\'s more\\nbeneath your words than you like to own to. You\\'ve been over to\\nsee that young scamp, ain\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I saw him, but I did not go out for that purpose.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s the truth, I reckon, for I\\'ve never known you to lie, and\\nI\\'ll be hanged if it ain\\'t that I like about you, after all.\\nYou\\'re the only person I kin spot, man or woman, who speaks the\\ntruth jest for the darn love of it.\"\\n\\n\"And yet I lived a lie for five years,\" returned Maria quietly.\\n\\n\"Maybe so, maybe so; but it set on you like the burr on a\\nchestnut, somehow, and when it rolled off thar you were, as clean\\nas ever. Well, you\\'re an honest and spunky woman, and I can\\'t\\nhelp your traipsing over thar even if I wanted to. But thar\\'s one\\nthing I tell you now right flat--if that young rascal wants to\\nkeep a whole skin he\\'d better stay off this place. I\\'d shoot him\\ndown as soon as I would a sheep-killing hound.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he won\\'t come here,\" said Maria faintly; and, going into the\\ndining-room, she dropped into a chair and lay with her arms\\noutstretched upon the table. The second shock to her emotional\\necstasy had been too much, and the furniture and Fletcher\\'s face\\nand the glare of the candle all spun before her in a sickening\\nconfusion.\\n\\nAfter looking at her anxiously an instant, Fletcher poured out a\\nglass of water and begged her to take a swallow. \"Thar, thar, I\\ndidn\\'t mean to skeer you,\" he said kindly. \"You mustn\\'t mind my\\nrough-and-ready ways, for I\\'m a plain man, God knows. If you are\\nsure you feel fainty,\" he added, \"I\\'ll git you a sip of whisky,\\nbut it\\'s a pity to waste it unless you have a turn.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m all right,\" answered Maria, sitting up, and returning\\nhis inquiring gaze with a shake of the head. \"My ankle is still\\nweak, you know, and I felt a sudden twinge from standing on it.\\nWhat were you looking for at this hour?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve been out in the air sense supper, and I feel kind of\\ngone. I thought I\\'d like a bite of something--maybe a scrap of\\nthat cold jowl we had for dinner. But I can\\'t find it. Do you\\nreckon Saidie is such a blamed fool as to throw the scraps away?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s Malindy, you know; she must eat.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to see one nigger eat up half a jowl,\" grumbled\\nFletcher, rooting among the dishes in the sideboard. \"Thar was a\\ngood big hunk of it left, for you didn\\'t touch it. You don\\'t seem\\nto thrive on our victuals,\" he added bluntly, turning to peer\\ninto her face.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a small eater; it makes little difference.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we mustn\\'t starve you,\" he said, as he went back to his\\nsearch; \"and if it\\'s a matter of a pound of fresh butter, or a\\nspring chicken, even, I won\\'t let it stand in your way. Why,\\nwhat\\'s this, I wonder?\"\\n\\nRipping out an oath with an angry snort, he drew forth Miss\\nSaidie\\'s walnut cake and held it squarely before the candle. \"I\\ndeclar, if she ain\\'t been making walnut cake agin, and I told her\\nlast week I wan\\'t going to have her wasting all my eggs. Look at\\nit, will you? If she\\'s beat up one egg in that cake she\\'s beat up\\na dozen, to say nothing of the sugar!\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t scold her, grandfather. She has a sweet tooth, you know,\\nand it\\'s so hard for her not to make desserts.\"\\n\\n\"Pish! Tush! I don\\'t reckon her tooth\\'s any sweeter than mine.\\nI\\'ve a powerful taste for trash myself, and always had since the\\ntime I overate ripe honey-shucks when I was six months old; but\\nthe taste don\\'t make me throw away good money. I\\'ll have no more\\nof this, I tell you, and I\\'ve said my say. She can bake a bit of\\ncake once a week if she\\'ll stint herself to an egg or two, but\\nwhen it comes to mixing up a dozen at a time, I\\'ll be darned if\\nI\\'ll allow it.\"\\n\\nLifting the plate in one hand, he stood surveying the big cake\\nwith disapproving yet admiring eyes. \"It would serve her right if\\nI was to eat up every precious crumb,\" he remarked at last.\\n\\n\"Suppose you try it,\" suggested Maria pleasantly. \"It would\\nplease Aunt Saidie.\"\\n\\n\"It ain\\'t to please her,\" sourly responded Fletcher, as he drove\\nthe knife with a lunge into the yellow loaf. \"She\\'s a thriftless,\\nno-account housekeeper, and I\\'ll tell her so tomorrow.\"\\n\\nStill holding the knife in his clenched fist, he sat munching the\\ncake with a relish which brought a smile to Maria\\'s tired eves.\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve a powerful sweet tooth myself,\" he added, as he cut\\nanother slice.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. Will Faces Desperation and Stands at Bay\\n\\nRising at daybreak next morning, Will\\'s eyes lighted in his first\\nglance from the window on Christopher\\'s blue-clad figure\\ncommanding the ploughed field on the left of the house. In the\\ndistance towered the black pines, and against them the solitary\\nworker was relieved in the slanting sunbeams which seemed to\\narrest and hold his majestic outline. The split basket of plants\\nwas on his arm, and he was busily engaged in \"setting out\" Will\\'s\\nneglected crop of tobacco.\\n\\nLeaving Molly still asleep, Will dressed himself hurriedly, and,\\nputting the diamond brooch in his pocket, ran out to where\\nChristopher was standing midway of the bare field.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re doing my work again,\" he said, not ungratefully.\\n\\n\"If I didn\\'t I\\'d like to know who would,\" responded Christopher\\nwith rough kindliness, as he dropped a wilted plant into a hole.\\n\"You\\'re up early this morning. Where are you off to?\"\\n\\nWill drew the brooch from his pocket and held it up with a laugh.\\n\\n\"Maria gave me this,\" he explained, \"and I\\'m going to town to\\nturn it into money.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll keep an eye on the place while you are away,\"\\nreturned Christopher, without looking at the trinket. \"Go about\\nyour business, and for heaven\\'s sake don\\'t stop to drink. Some\\nmen can stand liquor; you can\\'t. It makes a beast of you.\"\\n\\n\"And not of you, eh?\"\\n\\n\"It never gets the chance. I know when to stop. That\\'s the\\ndifference between us.\"\\n\\n\"Of course that\\'s the difference,\" rejoined Will a little\\ndoggedly. \"I never know when to stop about anything, I\\'ll be\\nhanged if I do. It\\'s my cursed luck to go at a headlong gait.\"\\n\\n\"And some day you\\'ll get your neck broken. Well, be off now, or\\nyou\\'ll most likely miss the stage.\"\\n\\nHe turned away to sort the young plants in his basket, while Will\\nstarted at a brisk pace for the cross-roads.\\n\\nThe planting was tedious work, and it was almost evening before\\nChristopher reached the end of the field and started home along\\nthe little winding lane. He had eaten a scant dinner with Molly,\\nwho had worried him by tearful complaints across the turnip\\nsalad. She had never looked prettier than in her thin white\\nblouse, with her disordered curls shadowing her blue eyes, and he\\nhad never found her more frankly selfish. Her shallow-rooted\\nnature awakened in him a feeling that was akin to repulsion, and\\nhe saw in imagination the gallant resolution with which Maria\\nwould have battled against such sordid miseries. At the first\\ntouch of her heroic spirit they would have been sordid no longer,\\nfor into the most squalid suffering her golden nature would have\\nshed something of its sunshine. Beauty would have surrounded her,\\nin Will\\'s cabin as surely as in Blake Hall. And with the thought\\nthere came to him the knowledge, wrung from experience, that\\nthere are souls which do not yield to events, but bend and shape\\nthem into the likeness of themselves. No favouring circumstance\\ncould have evolved Maria out of Molly, nor could any crushing one\\nhave formed Molly from Maria\\'s substance. The two women were as\\nfar asunder as the poles, united only by a certain softness of\\nsex he found in them both.\\n\\nThe sun had dropped behind the pines and a gray mist was floating\\nslowly across the level landscape. The fields were still in\\ndaylight, while dusk already enshrouded the leafy road, and it\\nwas from out the gloom that obscured the first short bend that he\\nsaw presently emerge the figure of a man who appeared to walk\\nunsteadily and with an effort.\\n\\nFor an instant Christopher stopped short in the lane; then he\\nwent forward at a single impetuous stride.\\n\\n\"Will!\" he cried in a voice of thunder.\\n\\nWill looked up with dazed eyes, and, seeing who had called him,\\nburst into a loud and boisterous laugh.\\n\\n\"So you\\'ll begin with your darn preaching,\" he remarked, gaping.\\n\\nFor reply, Christopher reached out, and, seizing him by the\\nshoulder, shook him roughly to his senses.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the meaning of this tomfoolery?\" he demanded. \"Do you\\nmean to say you\\'ve made a beast of yourself, after all?\"\\n\\nPartly sobered by the shock, Will gazed back at him with a dogged\\nmisery which gave his face the colour of extreme old age.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not so drunk as I look,\" he responded bitterly. \"I wish to\\nHeaven I were! There are worse things than being drunk, though\\nyou won\\'t believe it. I say,\" he added, in a sudden, hysterical\\nexclamation, \"you\\'re the only friend I have on earth!\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense. What have you been doing?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t help it--it wasn\\'t my fault, I\\'ll be blamed if it\\nwas! I did sell the breastpin and get the money, and wrapped it\\nin the list of things that Molly wanted. I put them in my\\npocket,\" he finished, touching his coat, \"the money and the list\\ntogether.\"\\n\\n\"And where is it?\"\\n\\nFor a moment Will did not reply, but stood shaking like a blade\\nof grass in a high wind. Then removing his hat, he mopped feebly\\nat the beads of sweat upon his forehead. His eyes had the dumb\\nappeal of a frightened animal\\'s. \"I haven\\'t had a morsel all\\nday,\" he whimpered, \"and the effect of the whisky has all worn\\noff.\"\\n\\n\"Speak up, man,\" said Christopher kindly. \"I can\\'t eat you.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not you,\" returned Will desperately; \"it\\'s Molly. I\\'m\\nafraid to go home and look Molly in the face.\"\\n\\n\"Pish! She doesn\\'t bite.\"\\n\\n\"She does worse; she cries.\"\\n\\n\"Then, for God\\'s sake, out with the trouble,\" urged Christopher,\\nlosing patience. \"You\\'ve lost the money, I take it; but how?\"\\n\\n\"There was a fair,\" groaned Will, his voice breaking. \"I met Fred\\nTurner and a strange man who owned horses, and they asked me to\\ncome and watch the racing. Then we had drinks and began to bet,\\nand somehow I always lost after the first time. Before I knew it\\nthe money was all gone, every single cent, and I owed Fred Turner\\na hundred and fifty dollars.\"\\n\\nChristopher\\'s gaze travelled slowly up and down the slight figure\\nbefore him and he swore softly beneath his breath.\\n\\n\"Well, you have made a mess of it!\" he exclaimed with a laugh.\\n\\n\"I knew you\\'d say so, and you\\'re the only friend I have on earth.\\nAs for Molly--oh, I\\'m afraid to go home, that\\'s all. Do you know,\\nI\\'ve half a mind to run away for good?\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! Accidents will happen, and there\\'s nothing in all this to\\ntake the pluck out of a man. I\\'ve been through worse things\\nmyself.\"\\n\\n\"But Fred Turner!\" groaned Will. \"I promised him I\\'d pay him in\\ntwo days.\"\\n\\n\"Then you\\'ll do it. I\\'ll undertake to see to that.\"\\n\\n\"You!\" exclaimed the other, with so abject a reliance upon the\\nspoken word that it brought a laugh from Christopher\\'s lips. \"How\\nwill you manage it?\"\\n\\nOh, somehow--mortgage the farm, I reckon. At any rate, in two\\ndays you shall be clear of your debt to Fred Turner; there\\'s my\\nword. All I hope is that you\\'ll learn a lesson from the fright.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I will, I will; and by Jove! you are a bully chap!\"\\n\\n\"Then go home and make your peace with Molly. Mind you, if you\\nget in liquor again I warn you I won\\'t lift a hand.\"\\n\\nWith a last cheery \"good night\" he swung on along the road,\\ndismissing the thought of Will to invoke that of Maria, and\\nmeeting again in fancy the rich promise of her upturned lips.\\nBody and soul she was his now, flame and clay, true brain and\\ntrue heart. \"I will follow you, for the lifting of a finger,\\nanywhere,\" she had said, and the words reeled madly in his\\nthoughts. Her impassioned look returned to him, and he closed his\\neyes as a man does in the face of an emotion which proclaims him\\ncraven.\\n\\nWhen Christopher\\'s footsteps had faded in the distance, Will, who\\nhad been looking wistfully after him, shook together his\\ndissolving courage and started with a strengthened purpose to\\nbear the bad news to Molly. A light streamed through the broken\\nshutters of her window, and when he laid his hand upon the door\\nit shot open and she stood before him.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re back at last,\" she said sharply; \"and late again.\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t help it,\" he answered with assumed indifference,\\nentering and passing quickly under the fire of her questioning\\nlook. \"I was kept.\"\\n\\n\"What kept you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, business.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d like to know what business you have!\" she retorted\\nquerulously; and a minute later: \"Have you brought the medicine?\"\\n\\nHe went over to the table and stood looking gloomily down upon\\nthe scattered remains of supper upon the sloppy oilcloth, the\\ncracked earthenware teapot, and the plate half filled with soppy\\nbread. \"Give me something to eat. I\\'m almost starved,\" he\\npleaded.\\n\\nA flash shot from her blue eyes, while the anger he had feared\\nworked threateningly in the features of her pretty face. There\\nwas no temperateness about Molly; she was all storm or sunshine,\\nhe had once said in the poetic days of courtship.\\n\\n\"If you\\'ve brought the things, where are they?\" she demanded,\\ndriving him squarely into a corner from which there was no escape\\nby subterfuge.\\n\\nA sullen defiance showed in his aspect, and he turned upon her\\nwith a muttered curse. \"I haven\\'t them, if you want the truth,\"\\nhe snarled. \"I meant to buy them, but Fred Turner got me to\\ndrinking and we bet on the races. I lost the money.\"\\n\\n\"To Fred Turner!\" cried Molly. \"Oh, you fool!\"\\n\\nHe made an angry movement toward her; then checking himself,\\nlaughed bitterly.\\n\\n\"You\\'re as bad as grandfather,\" he said, \"and it\\'s like jumping\\nfrom the frying-pan into the fire. I\\'ll be hanged if I knew you\\nwere a shrew when I married you!\"\\n\\nMolly\\'s eyes fairly blazed, and as she shook her head with an\\nenraged gesture, her hair, tumbling upon her shoulders, flooded\\nher with light. Even in the midst of his fury his ready senses\\nresponded to the appeal of her dishevelled loveliness.\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll be--anything if I knew you were a drunkard!\" she\\nretorted, pressing her hand upon her panting breast.\\n\\n\"Well, you ought to have known it,\" he sneered, \"for I was one.\\nChristopher Blake could have told you so. But if I remember\\nrightly, you weren\\'t so precious particular at the time. You were\\nglad enough to get anybody, as it happened!\"\\n\\n\"How--how dare you?\" wailed Molly, in the helplessness of her\\nrage, and throwing herself upon the lounge, she beat her hands\\nupon the wooden sides and burst into despairing sobs. \"Why, oh,\\nwhy did I marry you?\" she moaned between choking gasps.\\n\\n\"Some said it was because Fred Turner threw you over,\" returned\\nWill savagely, and having hurled his last envenomed dart, he\\nseized his hat and rushed out into the night.\\n\\nThe scene had worked like madness on his nerves, and in the\\ndarkness of the lane, where the trees kept out the moonbeams, he\\nstill saw the flickering lights that he had left behind him in\\nthe room. He had eaten nothing all day, and his empty stomach\\noppressed him with a sensation of nausea. His head spun like a\\ntop, and as he walked the road rocked in long seesaws beneath his\\nfeet. Yet his one craving was for drink, drink, more drink.\\n\\nRunning rather than walking, he reached the store at last, and\\nwent back to the little smoky room where Tom Spade was drawing\\nbeer from the big keg in one corner.\\n\\n\"Give me something to eat, Tom; I\\'m starving,\" he said; \"and\\nwhisky. I must have whisky or I\\'ll die.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s my belief that you\\'ll die if you do have it,\" responded\\nTom. \"As for bread and meat, however, Susan will give you a bite\\nan\\' welcome.\" Nevertheless, he poured out the whisky, and,\\nleaving it upon one of the dirty tables, went hastily out in\\nsearch of Mrs. Spade.\\n\\nLifting the glass with a shaking hand, Will drained it at a\\nsingle swallow, feeling his depleted courage revive as the raw\\nspirit burned his throat. A sudden heat invaded him; his eyes saw\\nclearer, and the tips of his fingers were endowed with a new\\nquality of touch. As his hands travelled slowly over his face he\\nbecame aware that he was looking through his finger ends, and he\\nnoted distinctly his haggard features and the short growth of\\nbeard which made him appear jaded and unwashed. Then almost\\ninstantly the quickness died out of his perception, and he felt\\nthe old numbness creeping back.\\n\\n\"Another glass--I must have another glass,\" he called out\\nirritably to the empty room. His hands hung stone dead again at\\nhis sides, and his head dropped limply forward upon his breast.\\nHe had forgotten his quarrel with Molly; he had forgotten\\neverything except his own miserable bodily condition.\\n\\nWhen Susan Spade came in with a plate of bread and ham, he roused\\nhimself with a nervous start and inhaled quickly the strong odour\\nof the meat, endeavouring through the sense of smell to reawaken\\nthe pang of hunger he had felt earlier in the evening. But in\\nplace of the gnawing emptiness there had come now a deadly\\nnausea, and after the first mouthful or two he pushed the food\\naway and called hoarsely for more whisky. His head ached in loud,\\nreverberating throbs, and a queer fancy possessed him that the\\nsound must be as audible to others as to himself. With the\\nthought, he glanced about suspiciously, but Tom Spade was\\nstopping the keg that he had tapped, and Susan was wiping off the\\ntable with energetic sweeps of her checked apron. Relieved by\\ntheir impassiveness, he braced himself with the determination to\\ndrink to the dead-line of unconsciousness and then lie down\\nsomewhere in the darkness to sleep off the effects.\\n\\n\"Whisky--give me more whisky,\" he repeated angrily.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Spade, true to her nature, saw fit to intervene between\\nhim and destruction.\\n\\n\"Not another drop, Mr. Will,\" she said decisively. \"Not another\\ndrop shall you have in this room if it\\'s the last mortal word I\\nspeak. An\\' if you\\'d had me by you in the beginning, I\\'m not\\nafeard to say, things would have held up a long sight sooner than\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you see I\\'m in downright agony?\" groaned Will, rapping the\\nglass upon the table. \"My head is splitting, I tell you, and I\\nmust have it.\"\\n\\n\"Not another drop, suh,\" replied Mrs. Spade with adamantine\\nfirmness of tone. \"I ain\\'t a weak woman, thank the Lord, an\\' as\\nfar as that goes, you might split to pieces inside and out right\\nhere befo\\' my eyes an\\' I wouldn\\'t be a party to sendin\\' you a\\nstep nearer damnation. I ain\\'t afeard of seein\\' folks suffer. Tom\\nwill tell you that.\"\\n\\n\"That she ain\\'t, suh,\" agreed Tom with pride. \"If I do say it who\\nshouldn\\'t, thar never was a woman who could stand mo\\' pain in\\nother people than can Susan. Mo\\' than that, Mr. Will, she\\'s\\nright, though I\\'d be sayin\\' so even if she wasn\\'t--seein\\' that\\nthe only rule for makin\\' a woman think yo\\' way is always to think\\nhers. But she\\'s right, and that\\'s the truth. You\\'ve had too\\nmuch.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re driving me mad between you!\" cried Will in\\ndesperation. \"I\\'m in awful trouble, and there\\'s nothing under\\nheaven will make me forget it except drink. One glass more--just\\none. That can\\'t hurt me.\"\\n\\n\"May he have one glass, Susan?\" asked Tom, appealing to his wife.\\n\\n\"Not another drop, suh,\" returned Mrs. Spade, immovable as a\\nrock.\\n\\n\"Not another drop, she says,\" repeated the big storekeeper in a\\nsinking voice. Then he laid his hand sympathetically on Will\\'s\\nshoulder. \"To be sure, I know you\\'re in trouble,\" he said, \"an\\'\\nI\\'ll swear it\\'s an out-an\\'-out shame, I don\\'t care who hears me.\\nYes, I\\'ll stand to it in the very face of Bill Fletcher himself.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s a devil!\" cried Will, stung by the name he hated.\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t sayin\\' you\\'ve been all you should have been,\" pursued\\nTom in his friendly tones, \"but as I told Susan yestiddy, a body\\ncan\\'t sow wild oats in one generation without havin\\' a volunteer\\ncrop spring up in the next. Now, yo\\' wild oats were sown long\\nbefo\\' you were born. Ain\\'t that so, Susan?\"\\n\\nMrs. Spade planted her hands squarely upon her hips and stood her\\nground with a solidity which was as impressive in its way as\\ndignity.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve spoken my mind to Bill Fletcher,\" she said, \"an\\' I\\'ll speak\\nit again. \\'How\\'s that boy goin\\' to live, suh?\\' That\\'s what I\\nasked, an\\' \\'twas after he told me to shut my mouth, that it was.\\nRight or wrong, that\\'s what I told him. You\\'ve gone an\\' made the\\nmeanest will this county has ever seen.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" cried Will, springing to his feet, while the room whirled\\nround him.\\n\\n\"Thar, thar, Susan, you\\'ve talked too much,\" interposed Tom, a\\nlittle frightened. \"What she means is just some foolishness yo\\'\\ngrandpa\\'s been lettin\\' out,\" he added; \"but he\\'ll live long\\nenough yet to change his mind an\\' his will, too.\"\\n\\n\"What is it about? Speak louder, will you? My ears buzz so I\\ncan\\'t hear thunder.\"\\n\\nTom coughed reproachfully at Susan.\\n\\n\"Well, he was talkin\\' down here last night about havin\\' changed\\nhis will,\" he said apologetically. \"He\\'s tied it up, it seems, so\\nyou can\\'t get it, an\\' he\\'s gone an\\' left the bulk of it to Mrs.\\nWyndham.\"\\n\\n\"To Maria!\" repeated Will, and saw scarlet.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what he says; but he\\'ll last to change his mind yet,\\nnever fear. Anger doesn\\'t live as long as a man--eh, Susan?\"\\n\\nBut Will had risen and was walking quite steadily toward the\\ndoor. His face was dead white, and there were deep blue circles\\nabout his eyes, which sparkled brilliantly. When he turned for a\\nmoment before going out, he sucked in his under lip with a\\nhissing sound.\\n\\n\"So this was Maria\\'s trick all along,\" he said hoarsely.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. How Christopher Comes Into His Revenge\\n\\n\"So this was Maria\\'s trick all along,\" he repeated, as he lurched\\nout into the road. \"This was what she had schemed for from the\\nbeginning--this was what her palavering and her protestations\\nmeant. Oh, it had been a deep game from the first, only he had\\nbeen too much of a blind fool to see the truth.\" A hundred facts\\narose to drive in the discovery; a hundred trivial details now\\nbristled with importance. Why had she been so willing--so eager,\\neven--to give away her little property, unless she intended to\\ndivert him with the crumbs while she reached for the whole loaf?\\nWhy, again, had she shrunk so from mentioning him to his\\ngrandfather? And why, still further, had she always fearfully\\npostponed a meeting between the two? He remembered suddenly that\\nshe had once drawn Molly behind the trees when the old man passed\\nalong the road. Poor, defrauded Molly! Forgetting his bitter\\nquarrel with her, he was ready to fall upon her neck in maudlin\\nsympathy.\\n\\nYes, it was all plain now--as clear as day. He saw one by one\\neach devilish move that she had made, and he meant to pay her\\nback for all before the night was over. He would tell her what he\\nthought of her, freely, fully, in words that she would never\\nforget. The names that he would use, the curses he would utter,\\nspun deliriously in his head, and as he went on he found himself\\nspeaking his phrases aloud to the darkness, trying upon the\\nsilence the effect of each blighting sentence.\\n\\nThe lights of the Hall twinkled presently among the trees, and,\\ncrossing the lawn, he crept into the little area under the back\\nsteps. If Maria was not in the kitchen, the servant would be, he\\nargued, and he would send up a peremptory summons which would\\nbring her down upon the instant. It was not late enough for her\\nto be in bed, at least, and he chuckled over the thought of the\\nsleepless night which she would spend.\\n\\nPushing back the door cautiously on its old, rusty hinges, he\\nentered on tip-toe and glanced suspiciously around. The room was\\nempty, but a lamp with a smoked chimney burned upon the table,\\nand there were the glimmering embers of a wood fire in the stove.\\nIt was just as he had left it the evening before, and this\\naroused in him a feeling of surprise, so long a stretch appeared\\nto cover the last twenty-four hours. The same basket of chicken\\nfeathers was in the sagging split-bottomed chair, the same pile\\nof black walnuts lay on the hearth, and the rusted hammer was\\nstill lying where he had dropped it upon the bricks. Even the\\nsmell was the same--a mixture of baked bread and burned feathers.\\n\\nGoing to the door that led into the house, he opened it and\\nlooked up the dark staircase; then a sound reached him from the\\ndining-room, and with nervous shiver he turned away and came back\\nto the stove. A dread paralysed him lest the meeting with Maria\\nshould be delayed until his courage oozed out of him, and to\\nnerve himself for the encounter he summoned to mind all the\\nevidence, which gathered in a cloud of witnesses, to prove her\\ntreachery. Once it occurred to him that after a few minutes of\\nwaiting he might tighten the screw upon his nerves and so pluck\\nup the audacity, if not the resolution, to ascend the stair\\nboldly and denounce her in the presence of his grandfather. But\\nthe memory of Fletcher\\'s face wagged before him, and, quaking\\nwith terror, he huddled with open palms above the stove. Then,\\npacing slowly up and down the room, he set to work frantically to\\nlash himself into the drunken bravado which he miscalled courage.\\n\\nOf a sudden his hunger assailed him, violent, convulsive, and,\\ngoing over to the tin safe, he rummaged among the cold scraps he\\nfound there, devouring greedily the food which lead been set by\\nfor the hounds. A bottle of Miss Saidie\\'s raspberry vinegar was\\nhidden in one corner, and he tore the paper label from the cork\\nand drank like a man who perishes from thirst. His energy, which\\nhad evaporated from fatigue and hunger, surged back in spasms of\\nanger, and as he turned away, invigorated, from the safe, he\\nrealised as he had never done before the full measure of his rage\\nagainst Maria. At the moment, had she come in upon him, he felt\\nthat he could have struck her in the face.\\n\\nBut she did not come, and the slow minutes fretted him in their\\npassage. A flame shot up in the stove, and, catching a knot of\\nresinous pine, burned steadily, licking patiently about the\\nfading embers. The air became charged again with the odour of\\nburned feathers, and he saw that a handful, with the dried blood\\nof the fowl still adhering to them, had been scattered upon the\\nashes. As he idly noted the colours of red and black, he\\nremembered with bitterness that he had raised game-cocks once\\nwhen he was a boy at the Hall, and that Maria had smashed a\\nnestful of his eggs in a fit of passion. The incident swelled to\\nenormous proportions in his thoughts, and he determined that he\\nwould remind her of it in the interview that was before them.\\n\\nThe door into the house creaked suddenly behind him; he wheeled\\nabout nervously, and then stood with hanging jaws staring into\\nthe face of Fletcher.\\n\\n\"So it is you, is it?\" said the old man, raising the stick he\\ncarried. \"So it is you, as I suspected--you darn rascal!\"\\n\\nBut the power of speech had departed from Will in the presence\\nthat he dreaded, and he stood clutching tightly to his harvest\\nhat, and shaking his head as if to deny the obvious fact of his\\nown identity.\\n\\n\"I thought it was you,\" pursued Fletcher, licking his dry lips.\\n\"I heard a noise, and I picked up my stick, thinking it was you.\\nI\\'ll have no thieving beggars on my place, I tell you, so the\\nquicker you git off the better. When were you here last, I\\'d like\\nto know?\"\\n\\n\"Yesterday,\" answered Will, speaking the truth from sheer\\nphysical inability to frame a lie. \"I came to see Maria. She\\'s\\ncheated me--she\\'s cheated me all along.\"\\n\\n\"Then she lied,\" said Fletcher softly. \"Then she lied and I\\ndidn\\'t know it.\"\\n\\n\"She\\'s cheated me,\" insisted Will hoarsely. \"It\\'s been all a\\nscheme of hers from the very beginning. She\\'s cheated me about\\nthe will, grandpa; I swear she has.\"\\n\\n\"Eh? What\\'s that?\" responded the old man, shaking back his heavy\\neyebrows. \"Say your say right now, for in five minutes you go off\\nthis place with every hound in the pack yelping at your heels.\\nI\\'ll not have you here--I\\'ll not have you here!\"\\n\\nThe words ended in a snarl, and a fleck of foam dropped on his\\ngray beard.\\n\\n\"But it was all Maria\\'s doing,\" urged Will passionately. \"She has\\nbeen against me from the first; I see that now. She\\'s plotted to\\noust me from the very start.\"\\n\\n\"Well, she might have spared herself the trouble,\" was Fletcher\\'s\\nsharp rejoinder.\\n\\n\"Let me explain--let me explain,\" pleaded the other, in a\\ndesperate effort to gain time; \"just a word or two--I only want a\\nword.\"\\n\\nBut when his grandfather drew back and stood glowering upon him\\nin silence, the speech he had wished to utter withered upon his\\nlips, blighted by a panic terror, and he stood mumbling\\nincoherently beneath his breath.\\n\\n\"Give me a word--a word is all I want,\" he reiterated wildly.\\n\\n\"Then out with your damned word and begone!\" roared Fletcher.\\n\\nWill\\'s eyes travelled helplessly around the room, seeking in vain\\nsome inspiration from the objects his gaze encountered. The tin\\nsafe, the basket of feathers, the pile of walnuts on the hearth,\\neach arrested his wandering attention for an instant, and he\\nbeheld all the details with amazing vividness.\\n\\nA mouse came out into the room, gliding like a shadow along the\\nwall to the pile of walnuts, and his eyes followed it as if drawn\\nby an invisible thread.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Maria--it\\'s all Maria,\" he stuttered, and could think of\\nnothing further. His brain seemed suddenly paralysed, and he\\nfound himself tugging hopelessly at the most commonplace word\\nwhich would not come. All his swaggering bravado had scampered\\noff at the first wag of the old man\\'s head.\\n\\n\"If that\\'s what you\\'ve got to say, you might as well be gone,\"\\nreturned Fletcher, moving toward him. \"I warn you now that the\\nnext time I find you here you won\\'t git off so easy. Maria or no\\nMaria, you ain\\'t goin\\' to lounge about this place so long as my\\nname is Bill Fletcher. The farther you keep yourself and your\\nyaller-headed huzzy out of my sight the better. Thar, now, be off\\nor you\\'ll git a licking.\"\\n\\n\"But I tell you Maria\\'s cheated me--she\\'s cheated me,\" returned\\nWill, his voice rising shrilly as he was goaded into revolt.\\n\"She\\'s been scheming to get the place all along; that\\'s her\\ntrick.\"\\n\\n\"Pish! Tush!\" responded Fletcher. \"Are you going or are you not?\"\\n\\nWill\\'s eyes burned like coals, and an observer, noting the two\\nmen as they stood glaring at each other, would have been struck\\nby their resemblance in attitude and expression rather than in\\nfeature. Both leaned slightly forward, with their chins thrust\\nout and their jaws dropped, and there was a ceaseless twitching\\nof the small muscles in both faces. The beast in each had sprung\\nviolently to the surface and recognised the likeness at which he\\nsnarled.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve left me to starve!\" cried Will, strangling a sob of\\nanger. \"It\\'s not fair! You have no right. The money ought to be\\nmine--I swear it ought!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it ought, ought it?\" sneered the old man, with an ugly\\nlaugh.\\n\\nAt the sound of the laugh, Will shrank back and shivered as if\\nfrom the stroke of a whip. The spirit of rage worked in his blood\\nlike the spirit of drink, and he felt his disordered nerves\\nrespond in a sudden frenzy.\\n\\n\"It ought to be mine, you devil, and you know it!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"I do, do I?\" retorted Fletcher, still cackling. \"Well, jest grin\\nat me a minute longer like that brazen wench your mother and I\\'ll\\nlay my stick across your shoulders for good and all. As for my\\nmoney, it\\'s mine, I reckon, and, living or dead, I\\'ll look to it\\nthat not one red cent gits to you. Blast you! Stop your\\ngrinning!\"\\n\\nHe raised the stick and made a long swerve sideways, but the\\nother, picking up the hammer from the hearth, jerked it above his\\nhead and stood braced for the assault. In the silence of the room\\nWill heard the thumping of his own heart, and the sound inspired\\nhim like the drums of battle. He was in a quiver from head to\\nfoot, but it was a quiver of rage, not of fear, and a glow of\\npride possessed him that he could lift his eyes and look Fletcher\\nsquarely in the face.\\n\\n\"You\\'re a devil--a devil! a devil!\" he cried shrilly, sticking\\nout his tongue like a pert and vulgar little boy. \"Christopher\\nBlake was right--you\\'re a devil!\"\\n\\nAs the name struck him between the eyes the old man lurched back\\nagainst the stove; then recovering himself, he made a swift\\nmovement forward and brought his stick down with all his force on\\nthe boy\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"Take that, you lying varmint!\" he shouted, choking.\\n\\nThe next instant his weapon had dropped from his hand, and he\\nreached out blindly, grappling with the air, for Will had turned\\nupon him with the spring of a wild beast and sent the hammer\\ncrushing into his temple.\\n\\nThere was a muffled thud, and Fletcher went down in a huddled\\nheap\\nupon the floor, while the other stood over him in the weakness\\nwhich had succeeded his drunken frenzy.\\n\\n\"I told you to let me alone. I told you I\\'d do it,\" said Will\\ndoggedly, and a moment later: \"I told you I\\'d do it.\"\\n\\nThe hammer was still in his hand, and, lifting it, he examined it\\nwith a morbid curiosity. A red fleck stained the iron, and\\nglancing down he saw that there was a splotch of blood on\\nFletcher\\'s temple. \"I told him I\\'d do it,\" he repeated, speaking\\nthis time to himself.\\n\\nThen instantly the silence in the room stopped his heartbeats and\\nset him quaking in a superstitious terror through every fiber. He\\nheard the stir of the mouse in the pile of walnuts, the hissing\\nof the flame above the embers, and the sudden breaking of the\\nsmoked chimney of the lamp. Then as he leaned down he heard\\nsomething else--the steady ticking of the big silver watch in\\nFletcher\\'s pocket.\\n\\nA horror of great darkness fell over him, and, turning, he reeled\\nlike a drunken man out into the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. The Fulfilling of the Law\\n\\nChristopher had helped Tucker upstairs to bed and had gone into\\nhis own room to undress, when a sharp and persistent rattle upon\\nthe closed shutters brought him in alarm to his feet. Looking\\nout, he saw a man\\'s figure outlined in the moonlight on the walk,\\nand, at once taking it to be Will, he ran hastily down and\\nunbarred the door.\\n\\n\"Come in quietly,\" he said. \"Uncle Tucker is asleep upstairs.\\nWhat in thunder is the trouble now?\"\\n\\nStepping back, he led the way into what so short a time ago had\\nbeen Mrs. Blake\\'s parlour, and then pausing in the center of the\\nfloor, stood waiting with knitted brows for an explanation of the\\nvisit. But Will, who had shrunk dazzled from the flash of the\\nlamp, now lingered to put up the bar with shaking hands.\\n\\n\"For God\\'s sake, what is it?\" questioned Christopher, and a start\\nshook through him at sight of the other\\'s face. \"Have you had a\\nfit?\"\\n\\nClosing the parlour door behind him, Will crossed the room and\\ncaught at the mantel for support. \"I told you I\\'d do it some\\nday--I told you I\\'d do it,\" he said incoherently, in a frantic\\neffort to shift the burden of responsibility upon stronger\\nshoulders.\\n\\n\"You might have known all along that I\\'d do it some day.\"\\n\\n\"Do what?\" demanded Christopher, while he felt the current of his\\nblood grow weak. \"Out with it, now. Speak up. You\\'re as white as\\na sheet.\"\\n\\n\"He struck me--he struck me first. The bruise is here,\" resumed\\nWill, in the same eager attempt at self justification. \"Then I\\nhit him on the head with a hammer and his skull gave way. I\\ndidn\\'t hit hard. I swear it was a little blow; but he\\'s dead. I\\nleft him stone dead in the kitchen. \"\\n\\n\"My God, man!\" exclaimed Christopher, and touched him on the\\nshoulder.\\n\\nWith a groan, Will put up his hands and covered his bloodshot\\neyes. \"I didn\\'t mean to do it--I swear I didn\\'t,\" he protested.\\n\"Who\\'d have thought his head would crush in like that at the\\nfirst little blow--just a tap with an old hammer? Why, it would\\nhardly have cracked a walnut! And what was the hammer doing\\nthere, anyway? They have no business to leave such things lying\\nabout on the hearth. It was all their fault--they ought to have\\nput the hammer away.\"\\n\\nA convulsive shudder ran through him, ending in his hands and\\nfeet, which jerked wildly. His face was gray and old--so old that\\nhe might have been taken, at the first glance, for a man of\\neighty, and in the intervals between his words he sucked in his\\nbreath with a hissing noise. Meeting Christopher\\'s look, he broke\\ninto a spasm of frightened sobs, whimpering like a child that has\\nbeen whipped.\\n\\n\"I told you not to drink again,\" said Christopher sharply as he\\nstruggled to collect his thoughts. \"I told you liquor would make\\na beast of you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll never touch another drop. I swear I\\'ll never touch another\\ndrop,\" groaned Will, still sobbing. \"I didn\\'t mean to kill him, I\\ntell you. It wasn\\'t as if I really meant to kill him; you see\\nthat. It was all the fault of that accursed hammer they left\\nlying on the hearth. A man must have a lot of courage to murder\\nanybody--mustn\\'t he?\" he added, with a feeble smile; \"and I\\'m a\\ncoward--you know I\\'ve always been a coward; haven\\'t I--haven\\'t\\nI?\" he persisted, and Christopher nodded an agreement.\\n\\n\"You see, I wasn\\'t to blame, after all; but he flew into such a\\nrage--he always flew into a rage when he heard your name.\"\\n\\n\"So you brought my name in?\" asked Christopher carelessly.\\n\\n\"Oh, it was that that did it; it was your name,\" replied Will\\nbreathlessly. \"I told him you said he was a devil--you did say\\nso, you know. Christopher Blake was right; he called you \\'a\\ndevil,\\' that was it. Then he ran at me with his stick, and I\\njerked up the hammer, and Oh, my God, they mustn\\'t hang me!\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" retorted Christopher roughly, for the other had\\ndropped upon the floor and was grovelling in drunken hysterics at\\nhis feet. \"It makes me sick to see a man act like an ass.\"\\n\\n\"Get me out of this and I\\'ll never touch a drop,\" moaned Will.\\n\"Take me away from here--hide me anywhere. I\\'ll go anywhere, I\\'ll\\npromise anything, only they mustn\\'t find me. If they find me I\\'ll\\ngo mad--I\\'ll go mad in gaol.\"\\n\\n\"Shut up!\" rejoined Christopher, listening with irritation to the\\nsound of the other\\'s hissing breath. \"Stop your infernal racket a\\nminute and let me think. Here, get up. Are you too drunk to stand\\non your feet?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sober--I\\'m perfectly sober,\" protested Will, and, rising\\nobediently, he stood clutching at the chimney-piece. \"Get me out\\nof this--only get me out of this,\" he repeated, with a desperate\\nreliance on the other\\'s power to avert the consequences of his\\ndeed. \"I\\'ve always been a good friend to you,\" he went on\\npassionately. \"The quarrel first started about you, and I stood\\nup for you to the last. I never let him say anything against\\nyou--I never did!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m much obliged to you,\" returned Christopher, and felt that he\\nmight as well have wasted his irony on a beaten hound. Turning\\naway from the wild entreaty of Will\\'s eyes, he walked slowly up\\nand down the room, taking care to step lightly lest the boards\\nshould creak and awaken Tucker.\\n\\nThe parlour was just as Mrs. Blake had left it; her highbacked\\nElizabethan chair, filled with cushions, stood on the hearth; the\\ndried grasses in the two tall vases shed their ashy pollen down\\nupon the bricks. Even the yellow cat, grown old and sluggish,\\ndozed in her favourite spot beside the embroidered ottoman.\\n\\nOn the whitewashed walls the old Blake portraits still presided,\\nand he found, for the first time, an artless humour in the\\nformality of the ancestral attitude--in the splendid pose which\\nthey had handed down like an heirloom through the centuries.\\nAmong them he saw the comely, high-coloured features of that\\ngallant cynic, Bolivar, the man who had stamped his beauty upon\\nthreegenerations, and his gaze lingered with a gentle ridicule on\\nthe blithe candour in the eyes and the characteristic touch of\\nbrutality about the mouth. Then he passed to his father, portly,\\nimpressive, a high liver, a generous young blood, and then to the\\nclassic Saint--Memin profile of Aunt Susannah, limned delicately\\nagainst a background of faded pink. And from her he went on to\\nhis mother\\'s portrait, painted in shimmering brocade under rose\\ngarlands held by smiling Loves.\\n\\nHe looked at them all steadily for a while, seeking from the\\nchangeless lips of each an answer to the question which he felt\\nknocking at his own heart. In every limb, in every feature, in\\nevery fiber he was plainly born to be one of themselves, and yet\\nfrom their elegant remoteness they stared down upon the rustic\\nlabourer who was their descendant. Degraded, coarsened,\\ndisinherited, the last Blake stood before them, with his poverty\\nand ignorance illumined only at long intervals by the flame of a\\nsoul which, though darkened, was still unquenched.\\n\\nThe night dragged slowly on, while he paced the floor with his\\nthoughts and Will moaned and tossed, a shivering heap, upon the\\nsofa.\\n\\n\"Stop your everlasting cackle!\" Christopher had once shouted\\nangrily, forgetting Tucker, and for the space of a few minutes\\nthe other had lain silent, choking back the strangling sobs. But\\npresently the shattered nerves revolted against restraint, and\\nWill burst out afresh into wild crying. The yellow cat, grown\\nsuddenly restless, crossed the room and jumped upon the sofa,\\nwhere she stood clawing at the cover, and he clung to her with a\\npathetic recognition of dumb sympathy--the sympathy which he\\ncould not wring from the careless indifference of Christopher\\'s\\nlook.\\n\\n\"Speak to me--say something,\" he pleaded at last, stretching out\\nhis hands. \"If this keeps up I\\'ll go mad before morning.\"\\n\\nAt this Christopher came toward him, and, stopping in his walk,\\nfrowned down upon the sofa.\\n\\n\"You deserve everything you\\'d get;\" he said angrily. \"You\\'re as\\nbig a fool as ever trod this earth, and there\\'s no reason under\\nheaven why I should lift my hand to help you. There\\'s no reason\\n--there\\'s no reason,\" he repeated in furious tones.\\n\\n\"But you\\'ll do it--you\\'ll get me out of it!\" cried Will, grasping\\nthe other\\'s knees.\\n\\n\"And two weeks later you\\'d be in another scrape.\"\\n\\n\"Not a single drop--I\\'ll never touch a drop again. Before God I\\nswear it!\"\\n\\n\"Pshaw! I\\'ve heard that oath before.\"\\n\\nStrangling a scream, Will caught him by the arm, dragging himself\\nslowly into a sitting posture. \"I\\'ll hang myself if you let them\\nget me,\" he urged hysterically. \" I\\'ll hang myself in gaol rather\\nthan let them do it. I can\\'t face it all I can\\'t--I can\\'t. It\\nisn\\'t grandpa I mind; I\\'m not afraid of him. He was a devil. But\\nit\\'s the rest--the rest.\"\\n\\nRoughly shaking him off, Christopher left him huddled upon the\\nfloor and resumed his steady walk up and down the room. In his\\nears the incoherent phrases grew presently fainter, and after a\\ntime he lost entirely their frenzied drift. \"A little blow--just\\na little blow,\" ended finally in muffled sounds of weeping.\\n\\nThe habit of outward composure which always came to him in\\nmoments of swift experience possessed him so perfectly now that\\nWill, lifting miserable eyes to his face, lowered them, appalled\\nby its unfeeling gravity.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been a good friend to you--a deuced good friend to you,\"\\nurged the younger man in a last passionate appeal for the aid\\nwhose direction he had not yet defined.\\n\\n\"What is this thought which I cannot get rid of?\" asked\\nChristopher moodily of himself. \"And what business is it of mine,\\nanyway? What am I to the boy or the boy to me?\" But even with the\\nwords he remembered the morning more than five years ago when he\\nhad gone out to the gate with his bird gun on his shoulder and\\nfound Will Fletcher and the spotted foxhound puppies awaiting him\\nin the road. He saw again the boy\\'s face, with the sunlight full\\nupon it--eager, alert, a little petulant, full of good impulses\\nreadily turned adrift. There had been no evil upon it then--only\\nweakness and a pathetic absence of determination. His own\\ndamnable intention was thrust back upon him, and he heard again\\nthe words of Carraway which had reechoed in his thoughts. \"The\\nway to touch the man, then, is through the boy.\" So it was the\\nway, after all .\\n\\nHe almost laughed aloud at his prophetic insight. He had touched\\nthe man vitally enough at last, and it was through the boy. He\\nhad murdered Bill Fletcher, and he had done it through the only\\nthing Bill Fletcher had ever loved. From this he returned again\\nto the memory of the deliberate purpose of that day--to the\\nribald jests, the coarse profanities, the brutal oaths. Then to\\nthe night when he had forced the first drink down Will\\'s throat,\\nand so on through the five years of his revenge to the present\\nmoment. Well, his triumph had come at last, the summit was put\\nupon his life\\'s work, and he was--he must be--content.\\n\\nWill raised his head and looked at him in reviving hope.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the only friend I have on earth,\" he muttered between his\\nteeth.\\n\\nThe first streak of dawn entered suddenly, flooding the room with\\na thin gray light in which the familiar objects appeared robbed\\nof all atmospheric values. With a last feeble flicker the lamp\\nshot up and went out, and the ashen wash of daybreak seemed the\\nfit medium for the crude ugliness of life.\\n\\nTowering almost grotesquely in the pallid dawn, Christopher came\\nand leaned above the sofa to which Will had dragged himself\\nagain.\\n\\n\"You must get out of this,\" he said, \"and quickly, for we\\'ve\\nwasted the whole night wrangling. Have you any money?\"\\n\\nWill fumbled in his pocket and brought out a few cents, which he\\nheld in his open palm, while the other unlocked the drawer of the\\nold secretary and handed him a roll of banknotes.\\n\\n\"Take this and buy a ticket somewhere. It\\'s the money I scraped\\nup to pay Fred Turner.\"\\n\\n\"To pay Fred Turner?\" echoed Will, as if in that lay the\\nsignificance of the remark.\\n\\n\"Take it and buy a ticket, and when you get where you\\'re going,\\nsit still and keep your mouth shut. If you wear a bold face you\\nwill go scot--free; remember that; but everything depends upon\\nyour keeping a stiff front. And now go--through the back door and\\npast the kitchen to the piece of woods beyond the pasture. Cut\\nthrough them to Tanner\\'s Station and take the train there, mind,\\nfor the North.\"\\n\\nWith a short laugh he held out his big, knotted hand.\\n\\n\"Good--by,\" he said, \" and don\\'t be a damned fool.\"\\n\\n\"Good--by,\" answered Will, clinging desperately to his\\noutstretched arm. Then an ashen pallor overspread his face, and\\nhe slunk nervously toward the kitchen, for there was the sound of\\nfootsteps on the little porch outside, followed by a brisk rap on\\nthe front door.\\n\\n\"Go!\" whispered Christopher, hardly taking breath, and he stood\\nwaiting while Will ran along the wooden platform and past the\\nstable toward the pasture.\\n\\nThe rap came again, and he turned quickly. \"Quit your racket and\\nlet me get on my clothes!\" he shouted, and hesitated a little\\nlonger.\\n\\nAs he stood alone there in the center of the room, his eyes,\\ntraversing the walls, fell on the portrait of Bolivar Blake, and\\nwith one of the fantastic tricks of memory there shot into his\\nhead the dying phrase of that gay sinner: \"I may not sit with the\\nsaints, but I shall stand among the gentlemen.\"\\n\\n\"Precious old ass!\" he muttered, and unbarred the door.\\n\\nAs he flung it open the first rays of sunlight splashed across\\nthe threshold, and he was conscious, all at once, of a strange\\nexhilaration, as if he were breasting one of the big waves of\\nlife.\\n\\n\"This is a pretty way to wake up a fellow who has been planting\\ntobacco till he\\'s stiff,\" he grumbled. \"Is that you, Tom?\" He\\nglanced carelessly round, nodding with a kind of friendly\\ncondescension to each man of the little group. \"How are you,\\nMatthew? Hello, Fred!\"\\n\\nTom drew back, coughing, and scraped the heel of his boot on the\\ntopmost step.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t mean to git you out of bed, Mr. Christopher,\" he\\nexplained apologetically, \"but the truth is we want Will Fletcher\\nan\\' he ain\\'t at home. The old man\\'s murdered, suh.\"\\n\\n\"Murdered, is he?\" exclaimed Christopher, with a long whistle,\\n\"and you want Will Fletcher--which shows what a very pretty\\nsheriff you would make. Well, if you\\'re so strong on his scent\\nthat you can\\'t turn aside, most likely you\\'ll find him sleeping\\noff his drunk under my haystack. But if you\\'re looking for the\\nman who killed Bill Fletcher, then that\\'s a different matter,\"\\nhe added, taking down his hat, \"and I reckon, boys, I\\'m about\\nready to come along.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. The Wheel of Life\\n\\nThroughout the trial he wore the sullen reserve which closed over\\nhim like a visor when he approached one of the crises of life. He\\nhad made his confession and he stood to it. \"I killed Bill\\nFletcher\" he gave out flatly enough. What he could not give was\\nan explanation of his unaccountable presence at the Hall so\\nnearly upon midnight. When the question was first put to him he\\nsneered and shrugged his shoulders with the hereditary gesture of\\nthe Blakes. \"Why was he there? Well, why wasn\\'t he there?\" That\\nwas all. And Carraway, who had stood by his side since the day of\\nthe arrest, retired at last before an attitude which he\\ncharacterised as one of defiant arrogance.\\n\\nIt was this attitude, people said presently, rather than the\\nmurder of Bill Fletcher, which brought him the sentence he heard\\nwith so insolent an indifference.\\n\\n\"Five years wasn\\'t much for killin\\' a man, maybe,\" Tom Spade\\nobserved, \"but it was a good deal, when you come to think of it,\\nfor a Blake to pay jest for gettin\\' even with a Fletcher. Why, he\\nmight have brained Bill Fletcher an\\' welcome,\" the storekeeper\\nadded a little wistfully, \"if only he hadn\\'t put on such a nasty\\nmanner afterward.\"\\n\\nBut it was behind this impregnable reserve that Christopher\\nretreated as into a walled fortress. There had been no sentiment\\nin his act, he told himself; he had not even felt the romantic\\nfervour of the sacrifice. A certain staunch justice was all he\\nsaw in it, relieved doubtless by a share of his hereditary love\\nof desperate hopes--of the hot--headed clinging to that last\\nshifting foothold on which a man might still make his fight\\nagainst the power of circumstance. And so, with that strange\\nmixture of rustic crudeness and aristocratic arrogance, he turned\\nhis face from his friends and went stubbornly through the\\ncross-questioning of the court.\\n\\n>From first to last he had not wavered in his refusal to see\\nMaria, and there had been an angry vehemence in the resistance he\\nhad made to her passionate entreaty for a meeting. When by the\\nearly autumn he went from the little town gaol to serve his five\\nyears in the State prison, his most vivid memory of her was as\\nshe looked with the moonlight on her face in the open field. As\\nthe months went on, this gradually grew remote and dim in his\\nremembrance, like a bright star over which the clouds thicken,\\nand his thoughts declined, almost without an upward inspiration,\\nupon the brutal level of his daily life. Mere physical disgust\\nwas his first violent recoil from what had seemed a curious\\ndeadness of his whole nature, and the awakening of the senses\\npreceded by many months the final resurrection of the more\\nspiritual emotions. The sources of health were still abundant in\\nhim, he admitted, if the vile air, the fetid smells, the\\ncloseness as of huddled animals, the filth, the obscenity, the\\ninsufferable bestial humanity could arouse in him a bodily nausea\\nso nearly resembling disease. There were moments when he felt\\ncapable of any crime from sheer frenzied loathing of his\\nsurroundings--when for the sake of the clean space of the tobacco\\nfields and the pure water of the little spring he would have\\nmurdered Bill Fletcher a dozen times. As for the old man\\'s death\\nin itself, it had never caused him so much as a quiver of the\\nconscience. Bill Fletcher deserved to die, and the world was well\\nrid of him--that was all.\\n\\nBut his own misery! This was with him always, and there was no\\nescape from the moral wretchedness which seemed to follow so\\nclosely upon crime. Fresh from the open country and the keen\\nwinds that blow over level spaces, he seemed mentally and\\nphysically to wither in the change of air--to shrink slowly to\\nthe perishing root, like a plant that has been brought from a\\nrich meadow to the aridity of the close--packed city. And with\\nthe growing of this strange form of homesickness he would be\\ndriven, at times, into an almost delirious cruelty toward those\\nwho were weaker than himself, for there were summer nights when\\nhe would brutally knock smaller men from the single window of the\\ncell and cling, panting for breath, to the iron bars. As the year\\nwent on, his grim silence, too, became for those around him as\\nthe inevitable shadow of the prison, and he went about his daily\\nwork in a churlish loneliness which caused even the convicts\\namong whom he lived to shrink back from his presence.\\n\\nThen with the closing of the second winter his superb physical\\nstrength snapped suddenly like a cord that has stood too tight a\\nstrain, and for weeks he lingered between life and death in the\\nhospital, into which he was carried while yet unconscious. With\\nhis returning health, when the abatement of the fever left him\\nstrangely shaken and the unearthly pallor still clung to his face\\nand hands, he awoke for the first time to a knowledge that his\\nillness had altered for the period of his convalescence, at least\\nthe vision through which he had grown to regard the world.\\n\\nA change had come to him, in that mysterious borderland so near\\nthe grave, and the bare places in his soul had burst suddenly\\ninto fulfilment. Sitting one Sunday morning in the open court of\\nthe prison, with his thin white hands hanging between his knees\\nand his head, cropped now of its thick, fair hair, raised to the\\nsunshine, it seemed to him that, like Tucker on the old bench, he\\nhad learned at last how to be happy. The warm sun in his face,\\nthe blue sky straight overhead, the spouting fountain from which\\na sparrow drank, produced in him a recognition, wholly\\npassionless, of the abundant physical beauty of the earth--of a\\nbeauty in the blue sky and in the clear sunshine falling upon the\\nprison court.\\n\\nA month ago he had wondered almost hopefully if his was to be one\\nof those pathetic sunken graves, marked for so brief a time by\\nwooden headboards the graves of the men who had died within the\\nwalls--and now there pulsed through him, sitting there alone, a\\nquiet satisfaction in the thought that he might still breathe the\\nair and look into men\\'s faces and see the blue sky overhead. The\\nsky in itself! That was enough to fill one\\'s memory to\\noverflowing, Tucker had said.\\n\\nA tall, lean convict, newly released from the hospital, crossed\\nthe court at a stumbling pace and stood for a moment at his side.\\n\\n\"I reckon you\\'re hankerin\\', he remarked. \"I was sent down here\\nfrom the mountains, an\\' I hanker terrible for the sight of the\\nold Humpback Knob.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'d like to see a level sweep--hardly a hill, just a clean\\nstretch for the wind to blow over the tobacco.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re from the tobaccy belt, then, ain\\'t you? What are you here\\nfor?\"\\n\\n\"Killing a man. And you?\"\\n\\n\"Killin\\' two.\"\\n\\nHe limped off at his feeble step, and Christopher rubbed his\\nhands in the warm sunshine and wondered how it would feel to bask\\non one of the old logs by the roadside.\\n\\nThat afternoon Jim Weatherby came to see him, bringing the news\\nthat Lila\\'s baby had come and that she had named it Christopher.\\n\"It\\'s the living image of you, she says,\" he added, smiling; \"but\\nI confess I can\\'t quite see it. The funny part is, you know, that\\nCynthia is just as crazy about it as Lila is, and she looks ten\\nyears younger since the little chap came.\"\\n\\n\"And Uncle Tucker?\"\\n\\n\"His old wounds trouble him, but he sent you word he was waiting\\nto go till you came back again.\"\\n\\nA blur swam before Christopher\\'s eyes, and he saw in fancy the\\nold soldier waiting for him on the bench beside the damask\\nrose-bush.\\n\\n\"And the others--and Maria Wyndham?\" he asked, swallowing the\\nlump in his throat.\\n\\nJim reached out and laid his hand on the broad stripes across the\\nother\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"She was with Mr. Tucker when he said that,\" he replied; \"they\\nare always together now; and she added; Tell him we shall wait\\ntogether till he comes.\"\\n\\nThe tears which had blinded Christopher\\'s eyes fell down upon his\\nclasped hands.\\n\\n\"My God! Let me live to go back!\" he cried out in his weakness.\\n\\n>From this time the element of hope entered into his life, and\\nlike its shadow there came the brooding fear that he should not\\nlive to see the year of his release. With his declining health he\\nhad been given lighter work in the prison factory, but the small\\ntasks seemed to him heavier than the large ones he remembered.\\nThere was no disease, the physician in the hospital assured him;\\nit was only his unusual form of homesickness feeding upon his\\nweakened frame. Let him return once more to the outdoor life and\\nthe fresh air of the tobacco fields and within six months his old\\nphysical hardihood would revive.\\n\\nIt was noticeable at this time that the quiet tolerance which had\\ngrown upon him in his convalescence drew to him the sympathy\\nwhich he had at first repulsed. The interest awakened in the\\nbeginning by some rare force of attraction in his mere bodily\\npresence became now, when he had fallen away to what seemed the\\nshadow of himself, a friendly and almost affectionate curiosity\\nconcerning his earlier history. With this there grew slowly a\\nrough companionship between him and the men among whom he lived,\\nand he found presently to his surprise that there was hardly one\\nof them but had some soft spot in his character--some particular\\nvirtue which was still alive. The knowledge of good and evil\\nthrust upon him in these months was not without effect in\\ndeveloping a certain largeness of outlook upon humanity--a kind\\nof generous philosophy which remained with him afterward in the\\nform of a peculiar mellowness of temperament.\\n\\nThe autumn of his third year was already closing when, being sent\\nfor one morning from the office of the superintendent, he went in\\nto find Cynthia awaiting him with his pardon in her hand. \"I\\'ve\\ncome for you, Christopher,\" she said, weeping at sight of his\\nwasted figure. \"The whole county has been working to get you out,\\nand you are free at last.\"\\n\\n\"Free at last?\" he repeated mechanically, and was conscious of a\\ndisappointment in the fact that he experienced no elation with\\nthe words. What was this freedom, that had meant so much to him a\\nmonth ago?\\n\\n\"Somebody in Europe wrote back to Maria,\" she added, while her\\ndry sobs rattled in her bosom, \"that the boy had confessed it to\\na priest who made him write it home. Oh, Christopher!\\nChristopher! I can\\'t understand!\"\\n\\n\"No, you can\\'t understand,\" returned Christopher, shaking his\\nhead. They would not understand, he knew, none of them--neither\\nthe world, nor Cynthia, nor his mother who was dead, nor Maria\\nwho was living. They would not understand, and even to himself\\nthe mystery was still unsolved. He had acted according to the law\\nof his own nature; this was all that was clear to him; and the\\ndestiny of character had controlled him from the beginning. The\\nwheel had turned and he with it, and being as blind as fate\\nitself he could see nothing further.\\n\\nBack once more in the familiar country, fresh from the strong\\ngrasp of friendly hands, and driving at sunset along the red road\\nbeneath half-bared honey-locusts, he was conscious, with a dull\\nthrob of regret, that the placid contentment he felt creeping\\nover him failed in emotional resemblance to the happiness he had\\nassociated with his return. Had the sap really gone dry within\\nhim, and would he go on forever with this curious numbness at his\\nheart?\\n\\n\"Maria wanted you to go straight to the Hall,\" said Cynthia,\\nturning suddenly, \"but I told her I\\'d better take you home and\\nput you to bed at once. It was she who went to the Governor and\\ngot your pardon,\" she added after a moment, \"but when I begged\\nher to come with me to take it to you she would not do it. She\\nwould not see you until you were back in your own place, she\\nsaid.\"\\n\\nHe smiled faintly, and, leaning back among the rugs Cynthia had\\nbrought, watched the white mist creeping over the ploughed\\nfields. The thought of Maria no longer stirred his pulses, and\\nwhen presently they reached the whitewashed cottage, and he sat\\nwith Tucker before the wood fire in his mother\\'s parlour, he\\nfound himself gazing with a dull impersonal curiosity at the\\nportraits smiling so coldly down upon the hearth. The memory of\\nhis mother left him as immovable as did the many trivial\\nassociations which thronged through his brain at sight of the\\nroom which had been hers. A little later, lying in her tester\\nbed, the fall of the acorns on the shingled roof above sent him\\ninto a profound and untroubled sleep.\\n\\nWith the first sunlight he awoke, and, noiselessly slipping into\\nhis clothes, went out for a daylight view of the country which\\nhad dwelt for so long a happy vision in his thoughts. The dew was\\nthick on the grass, and, crossing to the old bench, he sat down\\nin the pale sunshine beside the damask rosebush, on which a\\nsingle flower blossomed out of season. Beyond the cedars in the\\ngraveyard the sunrise flamed golden upon a violet background, and\\nacross the field of lifeeverlasting there ran a sparkling path of\\nfire. The air was strong with autumn scents, and as he drank it\\nin with deep drafts it seemed to him that he began to breathe\\nanew the spirit of life. With a single bound of the heart the\\nsense of freedom came to him, and with it the happiness that he\\nhad missed the evening before pulsed through his veins. Much yet\\nremained to him--the earth with its untold miracles, the sky with\\nits infinity of space, his own soul--and Maria!\\n\\nWith her name he sprang to his feet in the ardour of his\\nimpatience, and it was then that, looking up, he saw her coming\\nto him across the sunbeams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg etext of The Deliverance; A Romance\\nof the Virginia Tobacco Fields by Ellen Glasgow\\n',\n",

It is a story\\n    which will make the heart of many readers leap with joy._\\n\\n    _We have rarely printed a story in this magazine that for scientific\\n    interest, as well as suspense, could hold its own with this\\n    particular story. We prophesy that this story will become more\\n    valuable as the years go by. It certainly holds a number of\\n    interesting prophecies, of which no doubt, many will come true. For\\n    wealth of science, it will be hard to beat for some time to come. It\\n    is one of those rare stories that will bear reading and re-reading\\n    many times._\\n\\n    _This story has impressed us so favorably, that we hope the author\\n    may be induced to write a sequel to it soon._\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeword\\n\\n\\nElsewhere I have set down, for whatever interest they have in this, the\\n25th Century, my personal recollections of the 20th Century.\\n\\nNow it occurs to me that my memoirs of the 25th Century may have an\\nequal interest 500 years from now--particularly in view of that unique\\nperspective from which I have seen the 25th Century, entering it as I\\ndid, in one leap across a gap of 492 years.\\n\\nThis statement requires elucidation. There are still many in the world\\nwho are not familiar with my unique experience. Five centuries from now\\nthere may be many more, especially if civilization is fated to endure\\nany worse convulsions than those which have occurred between 1975 A.D.\\nand the present time.\\n\\nI should state therefore, that I, Anthony Rogers, am, so far as I know,\\nthe only man alive whose normal span of eighty-one years of life has\\nbeen spread over a period of 573 years. To be precise, I lived the first\\ntwenty-nine years of my life between 1898 and 1927; the other fifty-two\\nsince 2419. The gap between these two, a period of nearly five hundred\\nyears, I spent in a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages\\nof katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on my physical\\nor mental faculties.\\n\\nWhen I began my long sleep, man had just begun his real conquest of the\\nair in a sudden series of transoceanic flights in airplanes driven by\\ninternal combustion motors. He had barely begun to speculate on the\\npossibilities of harnessing sub-atomic forces, and had made no further\\npractical penetration into the field of ethereal pulsations than the\\nprimitive radio and television of that day. The United States of America\\nwas the most powerful nation in the world, its political, financial,\\nindustrial and scientific influence being supreme; and in the arts also\\nit was rapidly climbing into leadership.\\n\\nI awoke to find the America I knew a total wreck--to find Americans a\\nhunted race in their own land, hiding in the dense forests that covered\\nthe shattered and leveled ruins of their once magnificent cities,\\ndesperately preserving, and struggling to develop in their secret\\nretreats, the remnants of their culture and science--and the undying\\nflame of their sturdy independence.\\n\\nWorld domination was in the hands of Mongolians and the center of world\\npower lay in inland China, with Americans one of the few races of\\nmankind unsubdued--and it must be admitted in fairness to the truth, not\\nworth the trouble of subduing in the eyes of the Han Airlords who ruled\\nNorth America as titular tributaries of the Most Magnificent.\\n\\nFor they needed not the forests in which the Americans lived, nor the\\nresources of the vast territories these forests covered. With the\\nperfection to which they had reduced the synthetic production of\\nnecessities and luxuries, their remarkable development of scientific\\nprocesses and mechanical accomplishment of work, they had no economic\\nneed for the forests, and no economic desire for the enslaved labor of\\nan unruly race.\\n\\nThey had all they needed for their magnificently luxurious and degraded\\nscheme of civilization, within the walls of the fifteen cities of\\nsparkling glass they had flung skyward on the sites of ancient American\\ncenters, into the bowels of the earth underneath them, and with\\nrelatively small surrounding areas of agriculture.\\n\\nComplete domination of the air rendered communication between these\\ncenters a matter of ease and safety. Occasional destructive raids on the\\nwaste lands were considered all that was necessary to keep the \"wild\"\\nAmericans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent\\ntheir becoming a menace to the Han civilization.\\n\\nBut nearly three hundred years of easily maintained security, the last\\ncentury of which had been nearly sterile in scientific, social and\\neconomic progress, had softened and devitalized the Hans.\\n\\nIt had likewise developed, beneath the protecting foliage of the forest,\\nthe growth of a vigorous new American civilization, remarkable in the\\nmobility and flexibility of its organization, in its conquest of almost\\ninsuperable obstacles, in the development and guarding of its industrial\\nand scientific resources, all in anticipation of that \"Day of Hope\" to\\nwhich it had been looking forward for generations, when it would be\\nstrong enough to burst from the green chrysalis of the forests, soar\\ninto the upper air lanes and destroy the yellow incubus.\\n\\nAt the time I awoke, the \"Day of Hope\" was almost at hand. I shall not\\nattempt to set forth a detailed history of the Second War of\\nIndependence, for that has been recorded already by better historians\\nthan I am. Instead I shall confine myself largely to the part I was\\nfortunate enough to play in this struggle and in the events leading up\\nto it.\\n\\n[Illustration: Seen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as\\nthough it were being fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while\\nthe explosions of the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.]\\n\\nIt all resulted from my interest in radioactive gases. During the latter\\npart of 1927 my company, the American Radioactive Gas Corporation, had\\nbeen keeping me busy investigating reports of unusual phenomena observed\\nin certain abandoned coal mines near the Wyoming Valley, in\\nPennsylvania.\\n\\nWith two assistants and a complete equipment of scientific instruments,\\nI began the exploration of a deserted working in a mountainous district,\\nwhere several weeks before, a number of mining engineers had reported\\ntraces of carnotite[1] and what they believed to be radioactive gases.\\nTheir report was not without foundation, it was apparent from the\\noutset, for in our examination of the upper levels of the mine, our\\ninstruments indicated a vigorous radioactivity.\\n\\n    [1] A hydrovanadate of uranium, and other metals; used as a source\\n    of radium compounds.\\n\\nOn the morning of December 15th, we descended to one of the lowest\\nlevels. To our surprise, we found no water there. Obviously it had\\ndrained off through some break in the strata. We noticed too that the\\nrock in the side walls of the shaft was soft, evidently due to the\\nradioactivity, and pieces crumbled under foot rather easily. We made our\\nway cautiously down the shaft, when suddenly the rotted timbers above us\\ngave way.\\n\\nI jumped ahead, barely escaping the avalanche of coal and soft rock, but\\nmy companions, who were several paces behind me, were buried under it,\\nand undoubtedly met instant death.\\n\\nI was trapped. Return was impossible. With my electric torch I explored\\nthe shaft to its end, but could find no other way out. The air became\\nincreasingly difficult to breathe, probably from the rapid accumulation\\nof the radioactive gas. In a little while my senses reeled and I lost\\nconsciousness.\\n\\nWhen I awoke, there was a cool and refreshing circulation of air in the\\nshaft. I had no thought that I had been unconscious more than a few\\nhours, although it seems that the radioactive gas had kept me in a state\\nof suspended animation for something like 500 years. My awakening, I\\nfigured out later, had been due to some shifting of the strata which\\nreopened the shaft and cleared the atmosphere in the working. This must\\nhave been the case, for I was able to struggle back up the shaft over a\\npile of debris, and stagger up the long incline to the mouth of the\\nmine, where an entirely different world, overgrown with a vast forest\\nand no visible sign of human habitation, met my eyes.\\n\\nI shall pass over the days of mental agony that followed in my attempt\\nto grasp the meaning of it all. There were times when I felt that I was\\non the verge of insanity. I roamed the unfamiliar forest like a lost\\nsoul. Had it not been for the necessity of improvising traps and crude\\nclubs with which to slay my food, I believe I should have gone mad.\\n\\nSuffice it to say, however, that I survived this psychic crisis. I shall\\nbegin my narrative proper with my first contact with Americans of the\\nyear 2419 A.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I\\n\\nFloating Men\\n\\n\\nMy first glimpse of a human being of the 25th Century was obtained\\nthrough a portion of woodland where the trees were thinly scattered,\\nwith a dense forest beyond.\\n\\nI had been wandering along aimlessly, and hopelessly, musing over my\\nstrange fate, when I noticed a figure that cautiously backed out of the\\ndense growth across the glade. I was about to call out joyfully, but\\nthere was something furtive about the figure that prevented me. The\\nboy\\'s attention (for it seemed to be a lad of fifteen or sixteen) was\\ncentered tensely on the heavy growth of trees from which he had just\\nemerged.\\n\\nHe was clad in rather tight-fitting garments entirely of green, and wore\\na helmet-like cap of the same color. High around his waist he wore a\\nbroad, thick belt, which bulked up in the back across the shoulders,\\ninto something of the proportions of a knapsack.\\n\\nAs I was taking in these details, there came a vivid flash and heavy\\ndetonation, like that of a hand grenade, not far to the left of him. He\\nthrew up an arm and staggered a bit in a queer, gliding way; then he\\nrecovered himself and slipped cautiously away from the place of the\\nexplosion, crouching slightly, and still facing the denser part of the\\nforest. Every few steps he would raise his arm, and point into the\\nforest with something he held in his hand. Wherever he pointed there was\\na terrific explosion, deeper in among the trees. It came to me then that\\nhe was shooting with some form of pistol, though there was neither flash\\nnor detonation from the muzzle of the weapon itself.\\n\\nAfter firing several times, he seemed to come to a sudden resolution,\\nand turning in my general direction, leaped--to my amazement sailing\\nthrough the air between the sparsely scattered trees in such a jump as I\\nhad never in my life seen before. That leap must have carried him a full\\nfifty feet, although at the height of his arc, he was not more than ten\\nor twelve feet from the ground.\\n\\nWhen he alighted, his foot caught in a projecting root, and he sprawled\\ngently forward. I say \"gently\" for he did not crash down as I expected\\nhim to do. The only thing I could compare it with was a slow-motion\\ncinema, although I had never seen one in which horizontal motions were\\nregistered at normal speed and only the vertical movements were slowed\\ndown.\\n\\nDue to my surprise, I suppose my brain did not function with its normal\\nquickness, for I gazed at the prone figure for several seconds before I\\nsaw the blood that oozed out from under the tight green cap. Regaining\\nmy power of action, I dragged him out of sight back of the big tree. For\\na few moments I busied myself in an attempt to staunch the flow of\\nblood. The wound was not a deep one. My companion was more dazed than\\nhurt. But what of the pursuers?\\n\\nI took the weapon from his grasp and examined it hurriedly. It was not\\nunlike the automatic pistol to which I was accustomed, except that it\\napparently fired with a button instead of a trigger. I inserted several\\nfresh rounds of ammunition into its magazine from my companion\\'s belt,\\nas rapidly as I could, for I soon heard, near us, the suppressed\\nconversation of his pursuers.\\n\\nThere followed a series of explosions round about us, but none very\\nclose. They evidently had not spotted our hiding place, and were firing\\nat random.\\n\\nI waited tensely, balancing the gun in my hand, to accustom myself to\\nits weight and probable throw.\\n\\nThen I saw a movement in the green foliage of a tree not far away, and\\nthe head and face of a man appeared. Like my companion, he was clad\\nentirely in green, which made his figure difficult to distinguish. But\\nhis face could be seen clearly. It was an evil face, and had murder in\\nit.\\n\\nThat decided me. I raised the gun and fired. My aim was bad, for there\\nwas no kick in the gun, as I had expected, and I hit the trunk of the\\ntree several feet below him. It blew him from his perch like a crumpled\\nbit of paper, and he _floated_ down to the ground, like some limp, dead\\nthing, gently lowered by an invisible hand. The tree, its trunk blown\\napart by the explosion, crashed down.\\n\\nThere followed another series of explosions around us. These guns we\\nwere using made no sound in the firing, and my opponents were evidently\\nas much at sea as to my position as I was to theirs. So I made no\\nattempt to reply to their fire, contenting myself with keeping a sharp\\nlookout in their general direction. And patience had its reward.\\n\\nVery soon I saw a cautious movement in the top of another tree. Exposing\\nmyself as little as possible, I aimed carefully at the tree trunk and\\nfired again. A shriek followed the explosion. I heard the tree crash\\ndown; then a groan.\\n\\nThere was silence for a while. Then I heard a faint sound of boughs\\nswishing. I shot three times in its direction, pressing the button as\\nrapidly as I could. Branches crashed down where my shells had exploded,\\nbut there was no body.\\n\\nThen I saw one of them. He was starting one of those amazing leaps from\\nthe bough of one tree to another, about forty feet away.\\n\\nI threw up my gun impulsively and fired. By now I had gotten the feel of\\nthe weapon, and my aim was good. I hit him. The \"bullet\" must have\\npenetrated his body and exploded. For one moment I saw him flying\\nthrough the air. Then the explosion, and he had vanished. He never\\nfinished his leap. It was annihilation.\\n\\nHow many more of them there were I don\\'t know. But this must have been\\ntoo much for them. They used a final round of shells on us, all of which\\nexploded harmlessly, and shortly after I heard them swishing and\\ncrashing away from us through the tree tops. Not one of them descended\\nto earth.\\n\\nNow I had time to give some attention to my companion. She was, I found,\\na girl, and not a boy. Despite her bulky appearance, due to the peculiar\\nbelt strapped around her body high up under the arms, she was very\\nslender, and very pretty.\\n\\nThere was a stream not far away, from which I brought water and bathed\\nher face and wound.\\n\\nApparently the mystery of these long leaps, the monkey-like ability to\\njump from bough to bough, and of the bodies that floated gently down\\ninstead of falling, lay in the belt. The thing was some sort of\\nanti-gravity belt that almost balanced the weight of the wearer, thereby\\ntremendously multiplying the propulsive power of the leg muscles, and\\nthe lifting power of the arms.\\n\\nWhen the girl came to, she regarded me as curiously as I did her, and\\npromptly began to quiz me. Her accent and intonation puzzled me a lot,\\nbut nevertheless we were able to understand each other fairly well,\\nexcept for certain words and phrases. I explained what had happened\\nwhile she lay unconscious, and she thanked me simply for saving her\\nlife.\\n\\n\"You are a strange exchange,\" she said, eying my clothing quizzically.\\nEvidently she found it mirth provoking by contrast with her own neatly\\nefficient garb. \"Don\\'t you understand what I mean by \\'exchange?\\' I mean\\nah--let me see--a stranger, somebody from some other gang. What gang do\\nyou belong to?\" (She pronounced it \"gan,\" with only a suspicion of a\\nnasal sound.)\\n\\nI laughed. \"I\\'m not a gangster,\" I said. But she evidently did not\\nunderstand this word. \"I don\\'t belong to any gang,\" I explained, \"and\\nnever did. Does everybody belong to a gang nowadays?\"\\n\\n\"Naturally,\" she said, frowning. \"If you don\\'t belong to a gang, where\\nand how do you live? Why have you not found and joined a gang? How do\\nyou eat? Where do you get your clothing?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been eating wild game for the past two weeks,\" I explained, \"and\\nthis clothing I--er--ah--.\" I paused, wondering how I could explain that\\nit must be many hundred years old.\\n\\nIn the end I saw I would have to tell my story as well as I could,\\npiecing it together with my assumptions as to what had happened. She\\nlistened patiently; incredulously at first, but with more confidence as\\nI went on. When I had finished, she sat thinking for a long time.\\n\\n\"That\\'s hard to believe,\" she said, \"but I believe it.\" She looked me\\nover with frank interest.\\n\\n\"Were you married when you slipped into unconsciousness down in that\\nmine?\" she asked me suddenly. I assured her I had never married. \"Well,\\nthat simplifies matters,\" she continued. \"You see, if you were\\ntechnically classed as a family man, I could take you back only as an\\ninvited exchange and I, being unmarried, and no relation of yours,\\ncouldn\\'t do the inviting.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nThe Forest Gangs\\n\\n\\nShe gave me a brief outline of the very peculiar social and economic\\nsystem under which her people lived. At least it seemed very peculiar\\nfrom my 20th Century viewpoint.\\n\\nI learned with amazement that exactly 492 years had passed over my head\\nas I lay unconscious in the mine.\\n\\nWilma, for that was her name, did not profess to be a historian, and so\\ncould give me only a sketchy outline of the wars that had been fought,\\nand the manner in which such radical changes had come about. It seemed\\nthat another war had followed the First World War, in which nearly all\\nthe European nations had banded together to break the financial and\\nindustrial power of America. They succeeded in their purpose, though\\nthey were beaten, for the war was a terrific one, and left America, like\\nthemselves, gasping, bleeding and disorganized, with only the hollow\\nshell of a victory.\\n\\nThis opportunity had been seized by the Russian Soviets, who had made a\\ncoalition with the Chinese, to sweep over all Europe and reduce it to a\\nstate of chaos.\\n\\nAmerica, industrially geared to world production and the world trade,\\ncollapsed economically, and there ensued a long period of stagnation and\\ndesperate attempts at economic reconstruction. But it was impossible to\\nstave off war with the Mongolians, who by now had subjugated the\\nRussians, and were aiming at a world empire.\\n\\nIn about 2109, it seems, the conflict was finally precipitated. The\\nMongolians, with overwhelming fleets of great airships, and a science\\nthat far outstripped that of crippled America, swept in over the Pacific\\nand Atlantic Coasts, and down from Canada, annihilating American\\naircraft, armies and cities with their terrific _disintegrator_ rays.\\nThese rays were projected from a machine not unlike a searchlight in\\nappearance, the reflector of which, however, was not material substance,\\nbut a complicated balance of interacting electronic forces. This\\nresulted in a terribly destructive beam. Under its influence, material\\nsubstance melted into \"nothingness\"; i. e., into electronic vibrations.\\nIt destroyed all then known substances, from air to the most dense\\nmetals and stone.\\n\\nThey settled down to the establishment of what became known as the Han\\ndynasty in America, as a sort of province in their World Empire.\\n\\nThose were terrible days for the Americans. They were hunted like wild\\nbeasts. Only those survived who finally found refuge in mountains,\\ncanyons and forests. Government was at an end among them. Anarchy\\nprevailed for several generations. Most would have been eager to submit\\nto the Hans, even if it meant slavery. But the Hans did not want them,\\nfor they themselves had marvelous machinery and scientific process by\\nwhich all difficult labor was accomplished.\\n\\nUltimately they stopped their active search for, and annihilation of,\\nthe widely scattered groups of now savage Americans. So long as they\\nremained hidden in their forests, and did not venture near the great\\ncities the Hans had built, little attention was paid to them.\\n\\nThen began the building of the new American civilization. Families and\\nindividuals gathered together in clans or \"gangs\" for mutual protection.\\nFor nearly a century they lived a nomadic and primitive life, moving\\nfrom place to place, in desperate fear of the casual and occasional Han\\nair raids, and the terrible disintegrator ray. As the frequency of these\\nraids decreased, they began to stay permanently in given localities,\\norganizing upon lines which in many respects were similar to those of\\nthe military households of the Norman feudal barons, except that instead\\nof gathering together in castles, their defense tactics necessitated a\\ncertain scattering of living quarters for families and individuals. They\\nlived virtually in the open air, in the forests, in green tents,\\nresorting to camouflage tactics that would conceal their presence from\\nair observers. They dug underground factories and laboratories, that\\nthey might better be shielded from the electrical detectors of the\\nHans. They tapped the radio communication lines of the Hans, with crude\\ninstruments at first; better ones later on. They bent every effort\\ntoward the redevelopment of science. For many generations they labored\\nas unseen, unknown scholars of the Hans, picking up their knowledge\\npiecemeal, as fast as they were able to.\\n\\nDuring the earlier part of this period, there were many deadly wars\\nfought between the various gangs, and occasional courageous but\\nchildishly futile attacks upon the Hans, followed by terribly punitive\\nraids.\\n\\nBut as knowledge progressed, the sense of American brotherhood\\nredeveloped. Reciprocal arrangements were made among the gangs over\\nconstantly increasing areas. Trade developed to a certain extent, as\\nbetween one gang and another. But the interchange of knowledge became\\nmore important than that of goods, as skill in the handling of synthetic\\nprocesses developed.\\n\\nWithin the gang, an economy was developed that was a compromise between\\nindividual liberty and a military socialism. The right of private\\nproperty was limited practically to personal possessions, but private\\nprivileges were many, and sacredly regarded. Stimulation to achievement\\nlay chiefly in the winning of various kinds of leadership and\\nprerogatives, and only in a very limited degree in the hope of owning\\nanything that might be classified as \"wealth,\" and nothing that might be\\nclassified as \"resources.\" Resources of every description, for military\\nsafety and efficiency, belonged as a matter of public interest to the\\ncommunity as a whole.\\n\\nIn the meantime, through these many generations, the Hans had developed\\na luxury economy, and with it the perfection of gilded vice and\\ndegradation. The Americans were regarded as \"wild men of the woods.\" And\\nsince they neither needed nor wanted the woods or the wild men, they\\ntreated them as beasts, and were conscious of no human brotherhood with\\nthem. As time went on, and synthetic processes of producing foods and\\nmaterials were further developed, less and less ground was needed by the\\nHans for the purposes of agriculture, and finally, even the working of\\nmines was abandoned when it became cheaper to build up metal from\\nelectronic vibrations than to dig them out of the ground.\\n\\nThe Han race, devitalized by its vices and luxuries, with machinery and\\nscientific processes to satisfy its every want, with virtually no\\nnecessity of labor, began to assume a defensive attitude toward the\\nAmericans.\\n\\nAnd quite naturally, the Americans regarded the Hans with a deep, grim\\nhatred. Conscious of individual superiority as men, knowing that\\nlatterly they were outstripping the Hans in science and civilization,\\nthey longed desperately for the day when they should be powerful enough\\nto rise and annihilate the Yellow Blight that lay over the continent.\\n\\nAt the time of my awakening, the gangs were rather loosely organized,\\nbut were considering the establishment of a special military force,\\nwhose special business it would be to harry the Hans and bring down\\ntheir air ships whenever possible without causing general alarm among\\nthe Mongolians. This force was destined to become the nucleus of the\\nnational force, when the Day of Retribution arrived. But that, however,\\ndid not happen for ten years, and is another story.\\n\\n[Illustration: On the left of the illustration is a Han girl, and on the\\nright is an American girl, who, like all of her race, is equipped with\\nan inertron belt and a rocket gun.]\\n\\nWilma told me she was a member of the Wyoming Gang, which claimed the\\nentire Wyoming Valley as its territory, under the leadership of Boss\\nHart. Her mother and father were dead, and she was unmarried, so she was\\nnot a \"family member.\" She lived in a little group of tents known as\\nCamp 17, under a woman Camp Boss, with seven other girls.\\n\\nHer duties alternated between military or police scouting and factory\\nwork. For the two-week period which would end the next day, she had been\\non \"air patrol.\" This did not mean, as I first imagined, that she was\\nflying, but rather that she was on the lookout for Han ships over this\\noutlying section of the Wyoming territory, and had spent most of her\\ntime perched in the tree tops scanning the skies. Had she seen one she\\nwould have fired a \"drop flare\" several miles off to one side, which\\nwould ignite when it was floating vertically toward the earth, so that\\nthe direction or point from which it had been fired might not be guessed\\nby the airship and bring a blasting play of the disintegrator ray in her\\nvicinity. Other members of the air patrol would send up rockets on\\nseeing hers, until finally a scout equipped with an ultrophone, which,\\nunlike the ancient radio, operated on the ultronic ethereal vibrations,\\nwould pass the warning simultaneously to the headquarters of the Wyoming\\nGang and other communities within a radius of several hundred miles, not\\nto mention the few American rocket ships that might be in the air, and\\nwhich instantly would duck to cover either through forest clearings or\\nby flattening down to earth in green fields where their coloring would\\nprobably protect them from observation. The favorite American method of\\npropulsion was known as \"_rocketing_.\" The _rocket_ is what I would\\ndescribe, from my 20th Century comprehension of the matter, as an\\nextremely powerful gas blast, atomically produced through the\\nstimulation of chemical action. Scientists of today regard it as a\\nchildishly simple reaction, but by that very virtue, most economical and\\nefficient.\\n\\nBut tomorrow, she explained, she would go back to work in the cloth\\nplant, where she would take charge of one of the synthetic processes by\\nwhich those wonderful substitutes for woven fabrics of wool, cotton and\\nsilk are produced. At the end of another two weeks, she would be back on\\nmilitary duty again, perhaps at the same work, or maybe as a \"contact\\nguard,\" on duty where the territory of the Wyomings merged with that of\\nthe Delawares, or the \"Susquannas\" (Susquehannas) or one of the half\\ndozen other \"gangs\" in that section of the country which I knew as\\nPennsylvania and New York States.\\n\\nWilma cleared up for me the mystery of those flying leaps which she and\\nher assailants had made, and explained in the following manner, how the\\ninertron belt balances weight:\\n\\n\"_Jumpers_\" were in common use at the time I \"awoke,\" though they were\\ncostly, for at that time _inertron_ had not been produced in very great\\nquantity. They were very useful in the forest. They were belts,\\nstrapped high under the arms, containing an amount of inertron adjusted\\nto the wearer\\'s weight and purposes. In effect they made a man weigh as\\nlittle as he desired; two pounds if he liked.\\n\\n\"_Floaters_\" are a later development of \"_jumpers_\"--rocket motors\\nencased in _inertron_ blocks and strapped to the back in such a way that\\nthe wearer floats, when drifting, facing slightly downward. With his\\nmotor in operation, he moves like a diver, headforemost, controlling his\\ndirection by twisting his body and by movements of his outstretched arms\\nand hands. Ballast weights locked in the front of the belt adjust weight\\nand lift. Some men prefer a few ounces of weight in floating, using a\\nslight motor thrust to overcome this. Others prefer a buoyance balance\\nof a few ounces. The inadvertent dropping of weight is not a serious\\nmatter. The motor thrust always can be used to descend. But as an extra\\nprecaution, in case the motor should fail, for any reason, there are\\nbuilt into every belt a number of detachable sections, one or more of\\nwhich can be discarded to balance off any loss in weight.\\n\\n\"But who were your assailants,\" I asked, \"and why were you attacked?\"\\n\\nHer assailants, she told me, were members of an outlaw gang, referred to\\nas \"Bad Bloods,\" a group which for several generations had been under\\nthe domination of conscienceless leaders who tried to advance the\\ninterests of their clan by tactics which their neighbors had come to\\nregard as unfair, and who in consequence had been virtually boycotted.\\nTheir purpose had been to slay her near the Delaware frontier, making it\\nappear that the crime had been committed by Delaware scouts and thus\\nembroil the Delawares and Wyomings in acts of reprisal against each\\nother, or at least cause suspicions.\\n\\nFortunately they had not succeeded in surprising her, and she had been\\nsuccessful in dodging them for some two hours before the shooting began,\\nat the moment when I arrived on the scene.\\n\\n\"But we must not stay here talking,\" Wilma concluded. \"I have to take\\nyou in, and besides I must report this attack right away. I think we had\\nbetter slip over to the other side of the mountain. Whoever is on that\\npost will have a phone, and I can make a direct report. But you\\'ll have\\nto have a belt. Mine alone won\\'t help much against our combined weights,\\nand there\\'s little to be gained by jumping heavy. It\\'s almost as bad as\\nwalking.\"\\n\\nAfter a little search, we found one of the men I had killed, who had\\nfloated down among the trees some distance away and whose belt was not\\nbadly damaged. In detaching it from his body, it nearly got away from me\\nand shot up in the air. Wilma caught it, however, and though it\\nreinforced the lift of her own belt so that she had to hook her knee\\naround a branch to hold herself down, she saved it. I climbed the tree\\nand, with my weight added to hers, we floated down easily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nLife in the 25th Century\\n\\n\\nWe were delayed in starting for quite a while since I had to acquire a\\nfew crude ideas about the technique of using these belts. I had been\\nsitting down, for instance, with the belt strapped about me, enjoying an\\nease similar to that of a comfortable armchair; when I stood up with a\\nnatural exertion of muscular effort, I shot ten feet into the air, with\\na wild instinctive thrashing of arms and legs that amused Wilma greatly.\\n\\nBut after some practice, I began to get the trick of gauging muscular\\neffort to a minimum of vertical and a maximum of horizontal. The correct\\nform, I found, was in a measure comparable to that of skating. I found,\\nalso, that in forest work particularly the arms and hands could be used\\nto great advantage in swinging along from branch to branch, so\\nprolonging leaps almost indefinitely at times.\\n\\nIn going up the side of the mountain, I found that my 20th Century\\nmuscles did have an advantage, in spite of lack of skill with the belt,\\nand since the slopes were very sharp, and most of our leaps were upward,\\nI could have distanced Wilma easily. But when we crossed the ridge and\\ndescended, she outstripped me with her superior technique. Choosing the\\nsteepest slopes, she would crouch in the top of a tree, and propel\\nherself outward, literally diving until, with the loss of horizontal\\nmomentum, she would assume a more upright position and float downward.\\nIn this manner she would sometimes cover as much as a quarter of a mile\\nin a single leap, while I leaped and scrambled clumsily behind,\\nthoroughly enjoying the novel sensation.\\n\\nHalf way down the mountain, we saw another green-clad figure leap out\\nabove the tree tops toward us. The three of us perched on an outcropping\\nof rock from which a view for many miles around could be had, while\\nWilma hastily explained her adventure and my presence to her fellow\\nguard; whose name was Alan. I learned later that this was the modern\\nform of Helen.\\n\\n\"You want to report by phone then, don\\'t you?\" Alan took a compact\\npacket about six inches square from a holster attached to her belt and\\nhanded it to Wilma.\\n\\nSo far as I could see, it had no special receiver for the ear. Wilma\\nmerely threw back a lid, as though she were opening a book, and began to\\ntalk. The voice that came back from the machine was as audible as her\\nown.\\n\\nShe was queried closely as to the attack upon her, and at considerable\\nlength as to myself, and I could tell from the tone of that voice that\\nits owner was not prepared to take me at my face value as readily as\\nWilma had. For that matter, neither was the other girl. I could realize\\nit from the suspicious glances she threw my way, when she thought my\\nattention was elsewhere, and the manner in which her hand hovered\\nconstantly near her gun holster.\\n\\nWilma was ordered to bring me in at once, and informed that another\\nscout would take her place on the other side of the mountain. So she\\nclosed down the lid of the phone and handed it back to Alan, who seemed\\nrelieved to see us departing over the tree tops in the direction of the\\ncamps.\\n\\nWe had covered perhaps ten miles, in what still seemed to me a\\nsurprisingly easy fashion, when Wilma explained, that from here on we\\nwould have to keep to the ground. We were nearing the camps, she said,\\nand there was always the possibility that some small Han scoutship,\\ninvisible high in the sky, might catch sight of us through a\\nprojectoscope and thus find the general location of the camps.\\n\\nWilma took me to the Scout office, which proved to be a small building\\nof irregular shape, conforming to the trees around it, and substantially\\nconstructed of green sheet-like material.\\n\\nI was received by the assistant Scout Boss, who reported my arrival at\\nonce to the historical office, and to officials he called the Psycho\\nBoss and the History Boss, who came in a few minutes later. The attitude\\nof all three men was at first polite but skeptical, and Wilma\\'s ardent\\nadvocacy seemed to amuse them secretly.\\n\\nFor the next two hours I talked, explained and answered questions. I had\\nto explain, in detail, the manner of my life in the 20th Century and my\\nunderstanding of customs, habits, business, science and the history of\\nthat period, and about developments in the centuries that had elapsed.\\nHad I been in a classroom, I would have come through the examination\\nwith a very poor mark, for I was unable to give any answer to fully half\\nof their questions. But before long I realized that the majority of\\nthese questions were designed as traps. Objects, of whose purpose I knew\\nnothing, were casually handed to me, and I was watched keenly as I\\nhandled them.\\n\\nIn the end I could see both amazement and belief begin to show in the\\nfaces of my inquisitors, and at last the Historical and Psycho Bosses\\nagreed openly that they could find no flaw in my story or reactions, and\\nthat unbelievable as it seemed, my story must be accepted as genuine.\\n\\nThey took me at once to Big Boss Hart. He was a portly man with a \"poker\\nface.\" He would probably have been the successful politician even in the\\n20th Century.\\n\\nThey gave him a brief outline of my story and a report of their\\nexamination of me. He made no comment other than to nod his acceptance\\nof it. Then he turned to me.\\n\\n\"How does it feel?\" he asked. \"Do we look funny to you?\"\\n\\n\"A bit strange,\" I admitted. \"But I\\'m beginning to lose that dazed\\nfeeling, though I can see I have an awful lot to learn.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe we can learn some things from you, too,\" he said. \"So you fought\\nin the First World War. Do you know, we have very little left in the way\\nof records of the details of that war, that is, the precise conditions\\nunder which it was fought, and the tactics employed. We forgot many\\nthings during the Han terror, and--well, I think you might have a lot of\\nideas worth thinking over for our raid masters. By the way, now that\\nyou\\'re here, and can\\'t go back to your own century, so to speak, what do\\nyou want to do? You\\'re welcome to become one of us. Or perhaps you\\'d\\njust like to visit with us for a while, and then look around among the\\nother gangs. Maybe you\\'d like some of the others better. Don\\'t make up\\nyour mind now. We\\'ll put you down as an exchange for a while. Let\\'s see.\\nYou and Bill Hearn ought to get along well together. He\\'s Camp Boss of\\nNumber 34 when he isn\\'t acting as Raid Boss or Scout Boss. There\\'s a\\nvacancy in his camp. Stay with him and think things over as long as you\\nwant to. As soon as you make up your mind to anything, let me know.\"\\n\\nWe all shook hands, for that was one custom that had not died out in\\nfive hundred years, and I set out with Bill Hearn.\\n\\nBill, like all the others, was clad in green. He was a big man. That is,\\nhe was about my own height, five feet eleven. This was considerably\\nabove the average now, for the race had lost something in stature, it\\nseemed, through the vicissitudes of five centuries. Most of the women\\nwere a bit below five feet, and the men only a trifle above this height.\\n\\nFor a period of two weeks Bill was to confine himself to camp duties, so\\nI had a good chance to familiarize myself with the community life. It\\nwas not easy. There were so many marvels to absorb. I never ceased to\\nwonder at the strange combination of rustic social life and feverish\\nindustrial activity. At least, it was strange to me. For in my\\nexperience, industrial development meant crowded cities, tenements,\\npaved streets, profusion of vehicles, noise, hurrying men and women with\\nstrained or dull faces, vast structures and ornate public works.\\n\\nHere, however, was rustic simplicity, apparently isolated families and\\ngroups, living in the heart of the forest, with a quarter of a mile or\\nmore between households, a total absence of crowds, no means of\\nconveyance other than the belts called jumpers, almost constantly worn\\nby everybody, and an occasional rocket ship, used only for longer\\njourneys, and underground plants or factories that were to my mind more\\nlike laboratories and engine rooms; many of them were excavations as\\ndeep as mines, with well finished, lighted and comfortable interiors.\\nThese people were adepts at camouflage against air observation. Not only\\nwould their activity have been unsuspected by an airship passing over\\nthe center of the community, but even by an enemy who might happen to\\ndrop through the screen of the upper branches to the floor of the\\nforest. The camps, or household structures, were all irregular in shape\\nand of colors that blended with the great trees among which they were\\nhidden.\\n\\nThere were 724 dwellings or \"camps\" among the Wyomings, located within\\nan area of about fifteen square miles. The total population was 8,688,\\nevery man, woman and child, whether member or \"exchange,\" being listed.\\n\\nThe plants were widely scattered through the territory also. Nowhere was\\nanything like congestion permitted. So far as possible, families and\\nindividuals were assigned to living quarters, not too far from the\\nplants or offices in which their work lay.\\n\\nAll able-bodied men and women alternated in two-week periods between\\nmilitary and industrial service, except those who were needed for\\nhousehold work. Since working conditions in the plants and offices were\\nideal, and everybody thus had plenty of healthy outdoor activity in\\naddition, the population was sturdy and active. Laziness was regarded as\\nnearly the greatest of social offenses. Hard work and general merit were\\nvariously rewarded with extra privileges, advancement to positions of\\nauthority, and with various items of personal equipment for convenience\\nand luxury.\\n\\nIn leisure moments, I got great enjoyment from sitting outside the\\ndwelling in which I was quartered with Bill Hearn and ten other men,\\nwatching the occasional passers-by, as with leisurely, but swift\\nmovements, they swung up and down the forest trail, rising from the\\nground in long almost-horizontal leaps, occasionally swinging from one\\nconvenient branch overhead to another before \"sliding\" back to the\\nground farther on. Normal traveling pace, where these trails were\\nstraight enough, was about twenty miles an hour. Such things as\\nautomobiles and railroad trains (the memory of them not more than a\\nmonth old in my mind) seemed inexpressibly silly and futile compared\\nwith such convenience as these belts or jumpers offered.\\n\\nBill suggested that I wander around for several days, from plant to\\nplant, to observe and study what I could. The entire community had been\\napprised of my coming, my rating as an \"exchange\" reaching every\\nbuilding and post in the community, by means of ultronic broadcast.\\nEverywhere I was welcomed in an interested and helpful spirit.\\n\\nI visited the plants where ultronic vibrations were isolated from the\\nether and through slow processes built up into sub-electronic,\\nelectronic and atomic forms into the two great synthetic elements,\\nultron and inertron. I learned something, superficially at least, of the\\nprocesses of combined chemical and mechanical action through which were\\nproduced the various forms of synthetic cloth. I watched the manufacture\\nof the machines which were used at locations of construction to produce\\nthe various forms of building materials. But I was particularly\\ninterested in the munitions plants and the rocket-ship shops.\\n\\nUltron is a solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity,\\nwhich has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those\\npulsations known as light, electricity and heat. Since it is completely\\npermeable to light vibrations, it is therefore _absolutely invisible and\\nnon-reflective_. Its magnetic response is almost, but not quite, 100\\npercent also. It is therefore very heavy under normal conditions but\\nextremely responsive to the _repellor_ or anti-gravity rays, such as the\\nHans use as \"_legs_\" for their airships.\\n\\nInertron is the second great triumph of American research and\\nexperimentation with ultronic forces. It was developed just a few years\\nbefore my awakening in the abandoned mine. It is a synthetic element,\\nbuilt up, through a complicated heterodyning of ultronic pulsations,\\nfrom \"infra-balanced\" sub-ionic forms. It is completely inert to both\\nelectric and magnetic forces in all the orders above the _ultronic_;\\nthat is to say, the _sub-electronic_, the _electronic_, the _atomic_ and\\nthe _molecular_. In consequence it has a number of amazing and\\nvaluable properties. One of these is _the total lack of weight_. Another\\nis a total lack of heat. It has no molecular vibration whatever. It\\nreflects 100 percent of the heat and light impinging upon it. It does\\nnot feel cold to the touch, of course, since it will not absorb the heat\\nof the hand. It is a solid, very dense in molecular structure despite\\nits lack of weight, of great strength and considerable elasticity. It is\\na perfect shield against the disintegrator rays.\\n\\n[Illustration: Setting his rocket gun for a long-distance shot.]\\n\\nRocket guns are very simple contrivances so far as the mechanism of\\nlaunching the bullet is concerned. They are simple light tubes, closed\\nat the rear end, with a trigger-actuated pin for piercing the thin skin\\nat the base of the cartridge. This piercing of the skin starts the\\nchemical and atomic reaction. The entire cartridge leaves the tube under\\nits own power, at a very easy initial velocity, just enough to insure\\naccuracy of aim; so the tube does not have to be of heavy construction.\\nThe bullet increases in velocity as it goes. It may be solid or\\nexplosive. It may explode on contact or on time, or a combination of\\nthese two.\\n\\nBill and I talked mostly of weapons, military tactics and strategy.\\nStrangely enough he had no idea whatever of the possibilities of the\\nbarrage, though the tremendous effect of a \"curtain of fire\" with such\\nhigh-explosive projectiles as these modern rocket guns used was obvious\\nto me. But the barrage idea, it seemed, has been lost track of\\ncompletely in the air wars that followed the First World War, and in the\\npeculiar guerilla tactics developed by Americans in the later period of\\noperations from the ground against Han airships, and in the gang wars\\nwhich, until a few generations ago I learned, had been almost\\ncontinuous.\\n\\n\"I wonder,\" said Bill one day, \"if we couldn\\'t work up some form of\\nbarrage to spring on the Bad Bloods. The Big Boss told me today that\\nhe\\'s been in communication with the other gangs, and all are agreed that\\nthe Bad Bloods might as well be wiped out for good. That attempt on\\nWilma Deering\\'s life and their evident desire to make trouble among the\\ngangs, has stirred up every community east of the Alleghenies. The Boss\\nsays that none of the others will object if we go after them. So I\\nimagine that before long we will. Now show me again how you worked that\\nbusiness in the Argonne forest. The conditions ought to be pretty much\\nthe same.\"\\n\\nI went over it with him in detail, and gradually we worked out a\\nmodified plan that would be better adapted to our more powerful weapons,\\nand the use of jumpers.\\n\\n\"It will be easy,\" Bill exulted. \"I\\'ll slide down and talk it over with\\nthe Boss tomorrow.\"\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of my stay with the Wyomings, Wilma Deering\\nand I saw a great deal of each other. I naturally felt a little closer\\nfriendship for her, in view of the fact that she was the first human\\nbeing I saw after waking from my long sleep; her appreciation of my\\nsaving her life, though I could not have done otherwise than I did in\\nthat matter, and most of all my own appreciation of the fact that she\\nhad not found it as difficult as the others to believe my story,\\noperated in the same direction. I could easily imagine my story must\\nhave sounded incredible.\\n\\nIt was natural enough too, that she should feel an unusual interest in\\nme. In the first place, I was her personal discovery. In the second, she\\nwas a girl of studious and reflective turn of mind. She never got tired\\nof my stories and descriptions of the 20th Century.\\n\\nThe others of the community, however, seemed to find our friendship a\\nbit amusing. It seemed that Wilma had a reputation for being cold toward\\nthe opposite sex, and so others, not being able to appreciate some of\\nher fine qualities as I did, misinterpreted her attitude, much to their\\nown delight. Wilma and I, however, ignored this as much as we could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nA Han Air Raid\\n\\n\\nThere was a girl in Wilma\\'s camp named Gerdi Mann, with whom Bill Hearn\\nwas desperately in love, and the four of us used to go around a lot\\ntogether. Gerdi was a distinct type. Whereas Wilma had the usual dark\\nbrown hair and hazel eyes that marked nearly every member of the\\ncommunity, Gerdi had red hair, blue eyes and very fair skin. She has\\nbeen dead many years now, but I remember her vividly because she was a\\nthrowback in physical appearance to a certain 20th Century type which I\\nhave found very rare among modern Americans; also because the four of us\\nwere engaged one day in a discussion of this very point, when I obtained\\nmy first experience of a Han air raid.\\n\\nWe were sitting high on the side of a hill overlooking the valley that\\nteemed with human activity, invisible beneath its blanket of foliage.\\n\\nThe other three, who knew of the Irish but vaguely and indefinitely, as\\na race on the other side of the globe, which, like ourselves, had\\nsucceeded in maintaining a precarious and fugitive existence in\\nrebellion against the Mongolian domination of the earth, were listening\\nwith interest to my theory that Gerdi\\'s ancestors of several hundred\\nyears ago must have been Irish. I explained that Gerdi was an Irish\\ntype, evidently a throwback, and that her surname might well have been\\nMcMann, or McMahan, and still more anciently \"mac Mathghamhain.\" They\\nwere interested too in my surmise that \"Gerdi\" was the same name as that\\nwhich had been \"Gerty\" or \"Gertrude\" in the 20th Century.\\n\\nIn the middle of our discussion, we were startled by an alarm rocket\\nthat burst high in the air, far to the north, spreading a pall of red\\nsmoke that drifted like a cloud. It was followed by others at scattered\\npoints in the northern sky.\\n\\n\"A Han raid!\" Bill exclaimed in amazement. \"The first in seven years!\"\\n\\n\"Maybe it\\'s just one of their ships off its course,\" I ventured.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Wilma in some agitation. \"That would be green rockets. Red\\nmeans only one thing, Tony. They\\'re sweeping the countryside with their\\ndis beams. Can you see anything, Bill?\"\\n\\n\"We had better get under cover,\" Gerdi said nervously. \"The four of us\\nare bunched here in the open. For all we know they may be twelve miles\\nup, out of sight, yet looking at us with a projecto\\'.\"\\n\\nBill had been sweeping the horizon hastily with his glass, but\\napparently saw nothing.\\n\\n\"We had better scatter, at that,\" he said finally. \"It\\'s orders, you\\nknow. See!\" He pointed to the valley.\\n\\nHere and there a tiny human figure shot for a moment above the foliage\\nof the treetops.\\n\\n\"That\\'s bad,\" Wilma commented, as she counted the jumpers. \"No less than\\nfifteen people visible, and all clearly radiating from a central point.\\nDo they want to give away our location?\"\\n\\nThe standard orders covering air raids were that the population was to\\nscatter individually. There should be no grouping, or even pairing, in\\nview of the destructiveness of the disintegrator rays. Experience of\\ngenerations had proved that if this were done, and everybody remained\\nhidden beneath the tree screens, the Hans would have to sweep mile after\\nmile of territory, foot by foot, to catch more than a small percentage\\nof the community.\\n\\nGerdi, however, refused to leave Bill, and Wilma developed an equal\\nobstinacy against quitting my side. I was inexperienced at this sort of\\nthing, she explained, quite ignoring the fact that she was too; she was\\nonly thirteen or fourteen years old at the time of the last air raid.\\n\\nHowever, since I could not argue her out of it, we leaped together about\\na quarter of a mile to the right, while Bill and Gerdi disappeared down\\nthe hillside among the trees.\\n\\nWilma and I both wanted a point of vantage from which we might overlook\\nthe valley and the sky to the north, and we found it near the top of the\\nridge, where, protected from visibility by thick branches, we could look\\nout between the tree trunks, and get a good view of the valley.\\n\\nNo more rockets went up. Except for a few of those warning red clouds,\\ndrifting lazily in a blue sky, there was no visible indication of man\\'s\\npast or present existence anywhere in the sky or on the ground.\\n\\nThen Wilma gripped my arm and pointed. I saw it; away off in the\\ndistance; looking like a phantom dirigible airship, in its coat of\\nlow-visibility paint, a bare spectre.\\n\\n\"Seven thousand feet up,\" Wilma whispered, crouching close to me.\\n\"Watch.\"\\n\\nThe ship was about the same shape as the great dirigibles of the 20th\\nCentury that I had seen, but without the suspended control car, engines,\\npropellors, rudders or elevating planes. As it loomed rapidly nearer, I\\nsaw that it was wider and somewhat flatter than I had supposed.\\n\\nNow I could see the repellor rays that held the ship aloft, like\\nsearchlight beams faintly visible in the bright daylight (and still\\nfaintly visible to the human eye at night). Actually, I had been\\ninformed by my instructors, there were two rays; the visible one\\ngenerated by the ship\\'s apparatus, and directed toward the ground as a\\nbeam of \"carrier\" impulses; and the true repellor ray, the complement of\\nthe other in one sense, induced by the action of the \"carrier\" and\\nreacting in a concentrating upward direction from the mass of the earth,\\nbecoming successively electronic, atomic and finally molecular, in its\\nnature, according to various ratios of distance between earth mass and\\n\"carrier\" source, until, in the last analysis, the ship itself actually\\nis supported on an upward rushing column of air, much like a ball\\ncontinuously supported on a fountain jet.\\n\\nThe raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays were both slanted\\nastern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with tremendous\\nmomentum.\\n\\nThe ship was operating two disintegrator rays, though only in a casual,\\nintermittent fashion. But whenever they flashed downward with blinding\\nbrilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted instantaneously into\\nnothing, where they played upon them.\\n\\nWhen later I inspected the scars left by these rays I found them some\\nfive feet deep and thirty feet wide, the exposed surfaces being\\nlava-like in texture, but of a pale, iridescent, greenish hue.\\n\\nNo systematic use of the rays was made by the ship, however, until it\\nreached a point over the center of the valley--the center of the\\ncommunity\\'s activities. There it came to a sudden stop by shooting its\\nrepellor beams sharply forward and easing them back gradually to the\\nvertical, holding the ship floating and motionless. Then the work of\\ndestruction began systematically.\\n\\nBack and forth traveled the destroying rays, ploughing parallel furrows\\nfrom hillside to hillside. We gasped in dismay, Wilma and I, as time\\nafter time we saw it plough through sections where we knew camps or\\nplants were located.\\n\\n\"This is awful,\" she moaned, a terrified question in her eyes. \"How\\ncould they know the location so exactly, Tony? Did you see? They were\\nnever in doubt. They stalled at a predetermined spot--and--and it was\\nexactly the right spot.\"\\n\\nWe did not talk of what might happen if the rays were turned in our\\ndirection. We both knew. We would simply disintegrate in a split second\\ninto mere scattered electronic vibrations. Strangely enough, it was this\\nself-reliant girl of the 25th Century, who clung to me, a relatively\\nprimitive man of the 20th, less familiar than she with the thought of\\nthis terrifying possibility, for moral support.\\n\\nWe knew that many of our companions must have been whisked into absolute\\nnon-existence before our eyes in these few moments. The whole thing\\nparalyzed us into mental and physical immobility for I do not know how\\nlong.\\n\\nIt couldn\\'t have been long, however, for the rays had not ploughed more\\nthan thirty of their twenty-foot furrows or so across the valley, when I\\nregained control of myself, and brought Wilma to herself by shaking her\\nroughly.\\n\\n\"How far will this rocket gun shoot, Wilma?\" I demanded, drawing my\\npistol.\\n\\n\"It depends on your rocket, Tony. It will take even the longest range\\nrocket, but you could shoot more accurately from a longer tube. But why?\\nYou couldn\\'t penetrate the shell of that ship with rocket force, even if\\nyou could reach it.\"\\n\\nI fumbled clumsily with my rocket pouch, for I was excited. I had an\\nidea I wanted to try; a \"hunch\" I called it, forgetting that Wilma could\\nnot understand my ancient slang. But finally, with her help, I selected\\nthe longest range explosive rocket in my pouch, and fitted it to my\\npistol.\\n\\n\"It won\\'t carry seven thousand feet, Tony,\" Wilma objected. But I took\\naim carefully. It was another thought that I had in my mind. The\\nsupporting repellor ray, I had been told, became molecular in character\\nat what was called a logarithmic level of five (below that it was a\\npurely electronic \"flow\" or pulsation between the source of the\\n\"carrier\" and the average mass of the earth). Below that level if I\\ncould project my explosive bullet into this stream where it began to\\ncarry material substance upward, might it not rise with the air column,\\ngathering speed and hitting the ship with enough impact to carry it\\nthrough the shell? It was worth trying anyhow. Wilma became greatly\\nexcited, too, when she grasped the nature of my inspiration.\\n\\nFeverishly I looked around for some formation of branches against which\\nI could rest the pistol, for I had to aim most carefully. At last I\\nfound one. Patiently I sighted on the hulk of the ship far above us,\\naiming at the far side of it, at such an angle as would, so far as I\\ncould estimate, bring my bullet path through the forward repellor beam.\\nAt last the sights wavered across the point I sought and I pressed the\\nbutton gently.\\n\\nFor a moment we gazed breathlessly.\\n\\nSuddenly the ship swung bow down, as on a pivot, and swayed like a\\npendulum. Wilma screamed in her excitement.\\n\\n\"Oh, Tony, you hit it! You hit it! Do it again; bring it down!\"\\n\\nWe had only one more rocket of extreme range between us, and we dropped\\nit three times in our excitement in inserting it in my gun. Then,\\nforcing myself to be calm by sheer will power, while Wilma stuffed her\\nlittle fist into her mouth to keep from shrieking, I sighted carefully\\nagain and fired. In a flash, Wilma had grasped the hope that this\\ndiscovery of mine might lead to the end of the Han domination.\\n\\nThe elapsed time of the rocket\\'s invisible flight seemed an age.\\n\\nThen we saw the ship falling. It seemed to plunge lazily, but actually\\nit fell with terrific acceleration, turning end over end, its\\ndisintegrator rays, out of control, describing vast, wild arcs, and once\\ncutting a gash through the forest less than two hundred feet from where\\nwe stood.\\n\\nThe crash with which the heavy craft hit the ground reverberated from\\nthe hills--the momentum of eighteen or twenty thousand tons, in a sheer\\ndrop of seven thousand feet. A mangled mass of metal, it buried itself\\nin the ground, with poetic justice, in the middle of the smoking,\\nsemi-molten field of destruction it had been so deliberately ploughing.\\n\\nThe silence, the vacuity of the landscape, was oppressive, as the last\\nechoes died away.\\n\\nThen far down the hillside, a single figure leaped exultantly above the\\nfoliage screen. And in the distance another, and another.\\n\\nIn a moment the sky was punctured by signal rockets. One after another\\nthe little red puffs became drifting clouds.\\n\\n\"Scatter! Scatter!\" Wilma exclaimed. \"In half an hour there\\'ll be an\\nentire Han fleet here from Nu-yok, and another from Bah-flo. They\\'ll get\\nthis instantly on their recordographs and location finders. They\\'ll\\nblast the whole valley and the country for miles beyond. Come, Tony.\\nThere\\'s no time for the gang to rally. See the signals. We\\'ve got to\\njump. Oh, I\\'m so proud of you!\"\\n\\nOver the ridge we went, in long leaps toward the east, the country of\\nthe Delawares.\\n\\nFrom time to time signal rockets puffed in the sky. Most of them were\\nthe \"red warnings,\" the \"scatter\" signals. But from certain of the\\nothers, which Wilma identified as Wyoming rockets, she gathered that\\nwhoever was in command (we did not know whether the Boss was alive or\\nnot) was ordering an ultimate rally toward the south, and so we changed\\nour course.\\n\\nIt was a great pity, I thought, that the clan had not been equipped\\nthroughout its membership with ultrophones, but Wilma explained to me,\\nthat not enough of these had been built for distribution as yet,\\nalthough general distribution had been contemplated within a couple of\\nmonths.\\n\\nWe traveled far before nightfall overtook us, trying only to put as much\\ndistance as possible between ourselves and the valley.\\n\\nWhen gathering dusk made jumping too dangerous, we sought a comfortable\\nspot beneath the trees, and consumed part of our emergency rations. It\\nwas the first time I had tasted the stuff--a highly nutritive synthetic\\nsubstance called \"concentro,\" which was, however, a bit bitter and\\nunpalatable. But as only a mouthful or so was needed, it did not matter.\\n\\nNeither of us had a cloak, but we were both thoroughly tired and happy,\\nso we curled up together for warmth. I remember Wilma making some sleepy\\nremark about our mating, as she cuddled up, as though the matter were\\nall settled, and my surprise at my own instant acceptance of the idea,\\nfor I had not consciously thought of her that way before. But we both\\nfell asleep at once.\\n\\nIn the morning we found little time for love making. The practical\\nproblem facing us was too great. Wilma felt that the Wyoming plan must\\nbe to rally in the Susquanna territory, but she had her doubts about the\\nwisdom of this plan. In my elation at my success in bringing down the\\nHan ship, and my newly found interest in my charming companion, who was,\\nfrom my viewpoint of another century, at once more highly civilized and\\nyet more primitive than myself, I had forgotten the ominous fact that\\nthe Han ship I had destroyed must have known the exact location of the\\nWyoming Works.\\n\\nThis meant, to Wilma\\'s logical mind, either that the Hans had perfected\\nnew instruments as yet unknown to us, or that somewhere, among the\\nWyomings or some other nearby gang, there were traitors so degraded as\\nto commit that unthinkable act of trafficking in information with the\\nHans. In either contingency, she argued, other Han raids would follow,\\nand since the Susquannas had a highly developed organization and more\\nthan usually productive plants, the next raid might be expected to\\nstrike them.\\n\\nBut at any rate it was clearly our business to get in touch with the\\nother fugitives as quickly as possible, so in spite of muscles that were\\nsore from the excessive leaping of the day before, we continued on our\\nway.\\n\\nWe traveled for only a couple of hours when we saw a multi-colored\\nrocket in the sky, some ten miles ahead of us.\\n\\n\"Bear to the left, Tony,\" Wilma said, \"and listen for the whistle.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t they given you the rocket code yet?\" she replied. \"That\\'s what\\nthe green, followed by yellow and purple means; to concentrate five\\nmiles east of the rocket position. You know the rocket position itself\\nmight draw a play of disintegrator beams.\"\\n\\nIt did not take us long to reach the neighborhood of the indicated\\nrallying, though we were now traveling beneath the trees, with but an\\noccasional leap to a top branch to see if any more rocket smoke was\\nfloating above. And soon we heard a distant whistle.\\n\\nWe found about half the Gang already there, in a spot where the trees\\nmet high above a little stream. The Big Boss and Raid Bosses were busy\\nreorganizing the remnants.\\n\\nWe reported to Boss Hart at once. He was silent, but interested, when he\\nheard our story.\\n\\n\"You two stick close to me,\" he said, adding grimly, \"I\\'m going back to\\nthe valley at once with a hundred picked men, and I\\'ll need you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nSetting the Trap\\n\\n\\nInside of fifteen minutes we were on our way. A certain amount of\\ncaution was sacrificed for the sake of speed, and the men leaped away\\neither across the forest top, or over open spaces of ground, but\\nconcentration was forbidden. The Big Boss named the spot on the hillside\\nas the rallying point.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have to take a chance on being seen, so long as we don\\'t group,\"\\nhe declared, \"at least until within five miles of the rallying spot.\\nFrom then on I want every man to disappear from sight and to travel\\nunder cover. And keep your ultrophones open, and tuned on\\nten-four-seven-six.\"\\n\\nWilma and I had received our battle equipment from the Gear boss. It\\nconsisted of a long-gun, a hand-gun, with a special case of ammunition\\nconstructed of inertron, which made the load weigh but a few ounces, and\\na short sword. This gear we strapped over each other\\'s shoulders, on top\\nof our jumping belts. In addition, we each received an ultrophone, and a\\nlight inertron blanket rolled into a cylinder about six inches long by\\ntwo or three in diameter. This fabric was exceedingly thin and light,\\nbut it had considerable warmth, because of the mixture of inertron in\\nits composition.\\n\\n[Illustration: The Han raider neared with incredible speed. Its rays\\nwere both slanted astern at a sharp angle, so that it slid forward with\\ntremendous momentum.... Whenever the disintegrator rays flashed downward\\nwith blinding brilliancy, forest, rocks and ground melted\\ninstantaneously into nothing, where they played upon them.]\\n\\n\"This looks like business,\" Wilma remarked to me with sparkling eyes.\\n(And I might mention a curious thing here. The word \"business\" had\\nsurvived from the 20th Century American vocabulary, but not with any\\nmeaning of \"industry\" or \"trade,\" for such things being purely community\\nactivities were spoken of as \"work\" and \"clearing.\" Business simply\\nmeant fighting, and that was all.)\\n\\n\"Did you bring all this equipment from the valley?\" I asked the Gear\\nBoss.\\n\\n\"No,\" he said. \"There was no time to gather anything. All this stuff we\\ncleared from the Susquannas a few hours ago. I was with the Boss on the\\nway down, and he had me jump on ahead and arrange it. But you two had\\nbetter be moving. He\\'s beckoning you now.\"\\n\\nHart was about to call us on our phones when we looked up. As soon as we\\ndid so, he leaped away, waving us to follow closely.\\n\\nHe was a powerful man, and he darted ahead in long, swift, low leaps up\\nthe banks of the stream, which followed a fairly straight course at this\\npoint. By extending ourselves, however, Wilma and I were able to catch\\nup to him.\\n\\nAs we gradually synchronized our leaps with his, he outlined to us,\\nbetween the grunts that accompanied each leap, his plan of action.\\n\\n\"We have to start the big business--unh--sooner or later,\" he said.\\n\"And if--unh--the Hans have found any way of locating our\\npositions--unh--it\\'s time to start now, although the Council of\\nBosses--unh--had intended waiting a few years until enough rocket ships\\nhave been--unh--built. But no matter what the sacrifice--unh--we can\\'t\\nafford to let them get us on the run--unh--. We\\'ll set a trap for the\\nyellow devils in the--unh--valley if they come back for their\\nwreckage--unh--and if they don\\'t, we\\'ll go rocketing for some of their\\nliners--unh--on the Nu-yok, Clee-lan, Si-ka-ga course. We can\\nuse--unh--that idea of yours of shooting up the repellor--unh--beams.\\nWant you to give us a demonstration.\"\\n\\nWith further admonition to follow him closely, he increased his pace,\\nand Wilma and I were taxed to our utmost to keep up with him. It was\\nonly in ascending the slopes that my tougher muscles overbalanced his\\ngreater skill, and I was able to set the pace for him, as I had for\\nWilma.\\n\\nWe slept in greater comfort that night, under our inertron blankets, and\\nwere off with the dawn, leaping cautiously to the top of the ridge\\noverlooking the valley which Wilma and I had left.\\n\\nThe Boss scanned the sky with his ultroscope, patiently taking some\\nfifteen minutes to the task, and then swung his phone into use, calling\\nthe roll and giving the men their instructions.\\n\\nHis first order was for us all to slip our ear and chest discs into\\npermanent position.\\n\\nThese ultrophones were quite different from the one used by Wilma\\'s\\ncompanion scout the day I saved her from the vicious attack of the\\nbandit Gang. That one was contained entirely in a small pocket case.\\nThese, with which we were now equipped, consisted of a pair of ear\\ndiscs, each a separate and self-contained receiving set. They slipped\\ninto little pockets over our ears in the fabric helmets we wore, and\\nshut out virtually all extraneous sounds. The chest discs were likewise\\nself-contained sending sets, strapped to the chest a few inches below\\nthe neck and actuated by the vibrations from the vocal cords through the\\nbody tissues. The total range of these sets was about eighteen miles.\\nReception was remarkably clear, quite free from the static that so\\nmarked the 20th Century radios, and of a strength in direct proportion\\nto the distance of the speaker.\\n\\nThe Boss\\' set was triple powered, so that his orders would cut in on any\\nlocal conversations, which were indulged in, however, with great\\nrestraint, and only for the purpose of maintaining contacts.\\n\\nI marveled at the efficiency of this modern method of battle\\ncommunication in contrast to the clumsy signaling devices of more\\nancient times; and also at other military contrasts in which the 20th\\nand 25th Century methods were the reverse of each other in efficiency.\\nThese modern Americans, for instance, knew little of hand to hand\\nfighting, and nothing, naturally, of trench warfare. Of barrages they\\nwere quite ignorant, although they possessed weapons of terrific power.\\nAnd until my recent flash of inspiration, no one among them, apparently,\\nhad ever thought of the scheme of shooting a rocket into a repellor beam\\nand letting the beam itself hurl it upward into the most vital part of\\nthe Han ship.\\n\\nHart patiently placed his men, first giving his instructions to the\\ncampmasters, and then remaining silent, while they placed the\\nindividuals.\\n\\nIn the end, the hundred men were ringed about the valley, on the\\nhillsides and tops, each in a position from which he had a good view of\\nthe wreckage of the Han ship. But not a man had come in view, so far as\\nI could see, in the whole process.\\n\\nThe Boss explained to me that it was his idea that he, Wilma and I\\nshould investigate the wreck. If Han ships should appear in the sky, we\\nwould leap for the hillsides.\\n\\nI suggested to him to have the men set up their long-guns trained on an\\nimaginary circle surrounding the wreck. He busied himself with this\\nafter the three of us leaped down to the Han ship, serving as a target\\nhimself, while he called on the men individually to aim their pieces and\\nlock them in position.\\n\\nIn the meantime Wilma and I climbed into the wreckage, but did not find\\nmuch. Practically all of the instruments and machinery had been twisted\\nout of all recognizable shape, or utterly destroyed by the ship\\'s\\ndisintegrator rays which apparently had continued to operate in the\\nmidst of its warped remains for some moments after the crash.\\n\\nIt was unpleasant work searching the mangled bodies of the crew. But it\\nhad to be done. The Han clothing, I observed, was quite different from\\nthat of the Americans, and in many respects more like the garb to which\\nI had been accustomed in the earlier part of my life. It was made of\\nsynthetic fabrics like silks, loose and comfortable trousers of knee\\nlength, and sleeveless shirts.\\n\\nNo protection, except that against drafts, was needed, Wilma explained\\nto me, for the Han cities were entirely enclosed, with splendid\\narrangements for ventilation and heating. These arrangements of course\\nwere equally adequate in their airships. The Hans, indeed, had quite a\\ndistaste for unshaded daylight, since their lighting apparatus diffused\\na controlled amount of violet rays, making the unmodified sunlight\\nunnecessary for health, and undesirable for comfort. Since the Hans did\\nnot have the secret of inertron, none of them wore anti-gravity belts.\\nYet in spite of the fact that they had to bear their own full weights at\\nall times, they were physically far inferior to the Americans, for they\\nlived lives of degenerative physical inertia, having machinery of every\\ndescription for the performance of all labor, and convenient conveyances\\nfor any movement of more than a few steps.\\n\\nEven from the twisted wreckage of this ship I could see that seats,\\nchairs and couches played an extremely important part in their scheme of\\nexistence.\\n\\nBut none of the bodies were overweight. They seemed to have been the\\nbodies of men in good health, but muscularly much underdeveloped. Wilma\\nexplained to me that they had mastered the science of gland control, and\\nof course dietetics, to the point where men and women among them not\\nuncommonly reached the age of a hundred years with arteries and general\\nhealth in splendid condition.\\n\\nI did not have time to study the ship and its contents as carefully as I\\nwould have liked, however. Time pressed, and it was our business to\\ndiscover some clue to the deadly accuracy with which the ship had\\nspotted the Wyoming Works.\\n\\nThe Boss had hardly finished his arrangements for the ring barrage, when\\none of the scouts on an eminence to the north, announced the approach of\\nseven Han ships, spread out in a great semi-circle.\\n\\nHart leaped for the hillside, calling to us to do likewise, but Wilma\\nand I had raised the flaps of our helmets and switched off our\\n\"speakers\" for conversation between ourselves, and by the time we\\ndiscovered what had happened, the ships were clearly visible, so fast\\nwere they approaching.\\n\\n\"Jump!\" we heard the Boss order, \"Deering to the north. Rogers to the\\neast.\"\\n\\nBut Wilma looked at me meaningly and pointed to where the twisted plates\\nof the ship, projecting from the ground, offered a shelter.\\n\\n\"Too late, Boss,\" she said. \"They\\'d see us. Besides I think there\\'s\\nsomething here we ought to look at. It\\'s probably their magnetic graph.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re signing your death warrant,\" Hart warned.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll risk it,\" said Wilma and I together.\\n\\n\"Good for you,\" replied the Boss. \"Take command then, Rogers, for the\\npresent. Do you all know his voice, boys?\"\\n\\nA chorus of assent rang in our ears, and I began to do some fast\\nthinking as the girl and I ducked into the twisted mass of metal.\\n\\n\"Wilma, hunt for that record,\" I said, knowing that by the simple\\nprocess of talking I could keep the entire command continuously informed\\nas to the situation. \"On the hillsides, keep your guns trained on the\\ncircles and stand by. On the hilltops, how many of you are there? Speak\\nin rotation from Bald Knob around to the east, north, west.\"\\n\\nIn turn the men called their names. There were twenty of them.\\n\\nI assigned them by name to cover the various Han ships, numbering the\\nlatter from left to right.\\n\\n\"Train your rockets on their repellor rays about three-quarters of the\\nway up, between ships and ground. Aim is more important than elevation.\\nFollow those rays with your aim continuously. Shoot when I tell you, not\\nbefore. Deering has the record. The Hans probably have not seen us, or\\nat least think there are but two of us in the valley, since they\\'re\\nsettling without opening up disintegrators. Any opinions?\"\\n\\nMy ear discs remained silent.\\n\\n\"Deering and I remain here until they land and debark. Stand by and keep\\nalert.\"\\n\\nRapidly and easily the largest of the Han ships settled to the earth.\\nThree scouted sharply to the south, rising to a higher level. The others\\nfloated motionless about a thousand feet above.\\n\\nPeeping through a small fissure between two plates, I saw the vast hulk\\nof the ship come to rest full on the line of our prospective ring\\nbarrage. A door clanged open a couple of feet from the ground, and one\\nby one the crew emerged.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nThe \"Wyoming Massacre\"\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re coming out of the ship.\" I spoke quietly, with my hand over\\nmy mouth, for fear they might hear me. \"One--two--three--four,\\nfive--six--seven--eight--nine. That seems to be all. Who knows how\\nmany men a ship like that is likely to carry?\"\\n\\n\"About ten, if there are no passengers,\" replied one of my men, probably\\none of those on the hillside.\\n\\n\"How are they armed?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Just knives,\" came the reply. \"They never permit hand-rays on the\\nships. Afraid of accidents. Have a ruling against it.\"\\n\\n\"Leave them to us then,\" I said, for I had a hastily formed plan in my\\nmind. \"You, on the hillsides, take the ships above. Abandon the ring\\ntarget. Divide up in training on those repellor rays. You, on the\\nhilltops, all train on the repellors of the ships to the south. Shoot at\\nthe word, but not before.\\n\\n\"Wilma, crawl over to your left where you can make a straight leap for\\nthe door in that ship. These men are all walking around the wreck in a\\nbunch. When they\\'re on the far side, I\\'ll give the word and you leap\\nthrough that door in one bound. I\\'ll follow. Maybe we won\\'t be seen.\\nWe\\'ll overpower the guard inside, but don\\'t shoot. We may escape being\\nseen by both this crew and ships above. They can\\'t see over this wreck.\"\\n\\nIt was so easy that it seemed too good to be true. The Hans who had\\nemerged from the ship walked round the wreckage lazily, talking in\\nguttural tones, keenly interested in the wreck, but quite unsuspicious.\\n\\nAt last they were on the far side. In a moment they would be picking\\ntheir way into the wreck.\\n\\n\"Wilma, leap!\" I almost whispered the order.\\n\\nThe distance between Wilma\\'s hiding place and the door in the side of\\nthe Han ship was not more than fifteen feet. She was already crouched\\nwith her feet braced against a metal beam. Taking the lift of that\\nwonderful inertron belt into her calculation, she dove headforemost,\\nlike a green projectile, through the door. I followed in a split second,\\nmore clumsily, but no less speedily, bruising my shoulder painfully, as\\nI ricocheted from the edge of the opening and brought up sliding against\\nthe unconscious girl; for she evidently had hit her head against the\\npartition within the ship into which she had crashed.\\n\\nWe had made some noise within the ship. Shuffling footsteps were\\napproaching down a well lit gangway.\\n\\n\"Any signs we have been observed?\" I asked my men on the hillsides.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" I heard the Boss reply. \"Ships overhead still standing. No\\nbeams have been broken out. Men on ground absorbed in wreck. Most of\\nthem have crawled into it out of sight.\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" I said quickly. \"Deering hit her head. Knocked out. One or more\\nmembers of the crew approaching. We\\'re not discovered yet. I\\'ll take\\ncare of them. Stand a bit longer, but be ready.\"\\n\\nI think my last words must have been heard by the man who was\\napproaching, for he stopped suddenly.\\n\\nI crouched at the far side of the compartment, motionless. I would not\\ndraw my sword if there were only one of them. He would be a weakling, I\\nfigured, and I should easily overcome him with my bare hands.\\n\\nApparently reassured at the absence of any further sound, a man came\\naround a sort of bulkhead--and I leaped.\\n\\nI swung my legs up in front of me as I did so, catching him full in the\\nstomach and knocked him cold.\\n\\nI ran forward along the keel gangway, searching for the control room. I\\nfound it well up in the nose of the ship. And it was deserted. What\\ncould I do to jam the controls of the ships that would not register on\\nthe recording instruments of the other ships? I gazed at the mass of\\ncontrols. Levers and wheels galore. In the center of the compartment, on\\na massively braced universal joint mounting, was what I took for the\\nrepellor generator. A dial on it glowed and a faint hum came from within\\nits shielding metallic case. But I had no time to study it.\\n\\nAbove all else, I was afraid that some automatic telephone apparatus\\nexisted in the room, through which I might be heard on the other ships.\\nThe risk of trying to jam the controls was too great. I abandoned the\\nidea and withdrew softly. I would have to take a chance that there was\\nno other member of the crew aboard.\\n\\nI ran back to the entrance compartment. Wilma still lay where she had\\nslumped down. I heard the voices of the Hans approaching. It was time to\\nact. The next few seconds would tell whether the ships in the air would\\ntry or be able to melt us into nothingness. I spoke.\\n\\n\"Are you boys all ready?\" I asked, creeping to a position opposite the\\ndoor and drawing my hand-gun.\\n\\nAgain there was a chorus of assent.\\n\\n\"Then on the count of three, shoot up those repellor rays--all of\\nthem--and for God\\'s sake, don\\'t miss.\" And I counted.\\n\\nI think my \"three\" was a bit weak. I know it took all the courage I had\\nto utter it.\\n\\nFor an agonizing instant nothing happened, except that the landing party\\nfrom the ship strolled into my range of vision.\\n\\nThen startled, they turned their eyes upward. For an instant they stood\\nfrozen with horror at whatever they saw.\\n\\nOne hurled his knife at me. It grazed my cheek. Then a couple of them\\nmade a break for the doorway. The rest followed. But I fired pointblank\\nwith my hand-gun, pressing the button as fast as I could and aiming at\\ntheir feet to make sure my explosive rockets would make contact and do\\ntheir work.\\n\\nThe detonations of my rockets were deafening. The spot on which the Hans\\nstood flashed into a blinding glare. Then there was nothing there except\\ntheir torn and mutilated corpses. They had been fairly bunched, and I\\ngot them all.\\n\\nI ran to the door, expecting any instant to be hurled into infinity by\\nthe sweep of a disintegrator ray.\\n\\nSome eighth of a mile away I saw one of the ships crash to earth. A\\ndisintegrator ray came into my line of vision, wavered uncertainly for a\\nmoment and then began to sweep directly toward the ship in which I\\nstood. But it never reached it. Suddenly, like a light switched off, it\\nshot to one side, and a moment later another vast hulk crashed to earth.\\nI looked out, then stepped out on the ground.\\n\\nThe only Han ships in the sky were two of the scouts to the south which\\nwere hanging perpendicularly, and sagging slowly down. The others must\\nhave crashed down while I was deafened by the sound of the explosion of\\nmy own rockets.\\n\\nSomebody hit the other repellor ray of one of the two remaining ships\\nand it fell out of sight beyond a hilltop. The other, farther away,\\ndrifted down diagonally, its disintegrator ray playing viciously over\\nthe ground below it.\\n\\nI shouted with exultation and relief.\\n\\n\"Take back the command, Boss!\" I yelled.\\n\\nHis commands, sending out jumpers in pursuit of the descending ship,\\nrang in my ears, but I paid no attention to them. I leaped back into the\\ncompartment of the Han ship and knelt beside my Wilma. Her padded helmet\\nhad absorbed much of the blow, I thought; otherwise, her skull might\\nhave been fractured.\\n\\n\"Oh, my head!\" she groaned, coming to as I lifted her gently in my arms\\nand strode out in the open with her. \"We must have won, dearest, did\\nwe?\"\\n\\n\"We most certainly did,\" I reassured her. \"All but one crashed and that\\none is drifting down toward the south; we\\'ve captured this one we\\'re in\\nintact. There was only one member of the crew aboard when we dove in.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: As the American leaped, he swung his legs up in front of\\nhim, catching the Han full in the stomach.]\\n\\nLess than an hour afterward the Big Boss ordered the outfit to tune in\\nultrophones on three-twenty-three to pick up a translated broadcast of\\nthe Han intelligence office in Nu-yok from the Susquanna station. It\\nwas in the form of a public warning and news item, and read as follows:\\n\\n\"This is Public Intelligence Office, Nu-yok, broadcasting warning to\\nnavigators of private ships, and news of public interest. The squadron\\nof seven ships, which left Nu-yok this morning to investigate the recent\\ndestruction of the GK-984 in the Wyoming Valley, has been destroyed by a\\nseries of mysterious explosions similar to those which wrecked the\\nGK-984.\\n\\n\"The phones, viewplates, and all other signaling devices of five of the\\nseven ships ceased operating suddenly at approximately the same moment,\\nabout seven-four-nine.\" (According to the Han system of reckoning time,\\nseven and forty-nine one hundredths after midnight.) \"After violent\\ndisturbances the location finders went out of operation. Electroactivity\\nregisters applied to the territory of the Wyoming Valley remain dead.\\n\\n\"The Intelligence Office has no indication of the kind of disaster which\\novertook the squadron except certain evidences of explosive phenomena\\nsimilar to those in the case of the GK-984, which recently went dead\\nwhile beaming the valley in a systematic effort to wipe out the works\\nand camps of the tribesmen. The Office considers, as obvious, the\\ndeduction that the tribesmen have developed a new, and as yet\\nundetermined, technique of attack on airships, and has recommended to\\nthe Heaven-Born that immediate and unlimited authority be given the\\nNavigation Intelligence Division to make an investigation of this\\ntechnique and develop a defense against it.\\n\\n\"In the meantime it urges that private navigators avoid this territory\\nin particular, and in general hold as closely as possible to the\\nofficial inter-city routes, which now are being patrolled by the entire\\nforce of the Military Office, which is beaming the routes generously to\\na width of ten miles. The Military Office reports that it is at present\\nconsidering no retaliatory raids against the tribesmen. With the\\nNavigation Intelligence Division, it holds that unless further evidence\\nof the nature of the disaster is developed in the near future, the\\npublic interest will be better served, and at smaller cost of life, by a\\nscientific research than by attempts at retaliation, which may bring\\ndestruction on all ships engaging therein. So unless further evidence\\nactually is developed, or the Heaven-Born orders to the contrary, the\\nMilitary will hold to a defensive policy.\\n\\n\"Unofficial intimations from Lo-Tan are to the effect that the\\nHeaven-Council has the matter under consideration.\\n\\n\"The Navigation Intelligence Office permits the broadcast of the\\nfollowing condensation of its detailed observations:\\n\\n\"The squadron proceeded to a position above the Wyoming Valley where\\nthe wreck of the GK-984 was known to be, from the record of its location\\nfinder before it went dead recently. There the bottom projectoscope\\nrelays of all ships registered the wreck of the GK-984. Teleprojectoscope\\nviews of the wreck and the bowl of the valley showed no evidence of the\\npresence of tribesmen. Neither ship registers nor base registers showed\\nany indication of electroactivity except from the squadron itself. On\\norders from the Base Squadron Commander, the LD-248, LK-745 and LG-25\\nscouted southward at 3,000 feet. The GK-43, GK-981 and GK-220 stood\\nabove at 2,500 feet, and the GK-18 landed to permit personal inspection\\nof the wreck by the science committee. The party debarked, leaving one\\nman on board in the control cabin. He set all projectoscopes at\\nuniversal focus except RB-3,\" (this meant the third projectoscope from\\nthe bow of the ship, on the right-hand side of the lower deck) \"with\\nwhich he followed the landing group as it walked around the wreck.\\n\\n\"The first abnormal phenomenon recorded by any of the instruments at\\nBase was that relayed automatically from projectoscope RB-4 of the\\nGK-18, which as the party disappeared from view in back of the wreck,\\nrecorded two green missiles of roughly cylindrical shape, projected from\\nthe wreckage into the landing compartment of the ship. At such close\\nrange these were not clearly defined, owing to the universal focus at\\nwhich the projectoscope was set. The Base Captain of GK-18 at once\\nordered the man in the control room to investigate, and saw him leave\\nthe control room in compliance with this order. An instant later\\nconfused sounds reached the control-room electrophone, such as might be\\nmade by a man falling heavily, and footsteps reapproached the control\\nroom, a figure entering and leaving the control room hurriedly. The Base\\nCaptain now believes, and the stills of the photorecord support his\\nbelief, that this was not the crew member who had been left in the\\ncontrol room. Before the Base Captain could speak to him he left the\\nroom, nor was any response given to the attention signal the Captain\\nflashed throughout the ship.\\n\\n\"At this point projectoscope RB-3 of the ship now out of focus control,\\ndimly showed the landing party walking back toward the ship. RB-4 showed\\nit more clearly. Then on both these instruments, a number of blinding\\nexplosives in rapid succession were seen and the electrophone relays\\nregistered terrific concussions; the ship\\'s electronic apparatus and\\nprojectoscopes apparatus went dead.\\n\\n\"Reports of the other ships\\' Base Observers and Executives, backed by\\nthe photorecords, show the explosions as taking place in the midst of\\nthe landing party as it returned, evidently unsuspicious, to the ship.\\nThen in rapid succession they indicate that terrific explosions occurred\\ninside and outside the three ships standing above close to their rep-ray\\ngenerators, and all signals from these ships thereupon went dead.\\n\\n\"Of the three ships scouting to the south, the LD-248 suffered an\\nidentical fate, at the same moment. Its records add little to the\\nknowledge of the disaster. But with the LK-745 and the LG-25 it was\\ndifferent.\\n\\n\"The relay instruments of the LK-745 indicated the destruction by an\\nexplosion of the rear rep-ray generator, and that the ship hung stern\\ndown for a short space, swinging like a pendulum. The forward viewplates\\nand indicators did not cease functioning, but their records are chaotic,\\nexcept for one projectoscope still, which shows the bowl of the valley,\\nand the GK-981 falling, but no visible evidence of tribesmen. The\\ncontrol-room viewplate is also a chaotic record of the ship\\'s crew\\ntumbling and falling to the rear wall. Then the forward rep-ray\\ngenerator exploded, and all signals went dead.\\n\\n\"The fate of the LG-25 was somewhat similar, except that this ship hung\\nnose down, and drifted on the wind southward as it slowly descended out\\nof control.\\n\\n\"As its control room was shattered, verbal report from its Action\\nCaptain was precluded. The record of the interior rear viewplate shows\\nmembers of the crew climbing toward the rear rep-ray generator in an\\nattempt to establish manual control of it, and increase the lift. The\\nprojectoscope relays, swinging in wide arcs, recorded little of value\\nexcept at the ends of their swings. One of these, from a machine which\\nhappened to be set in telescopic focus, shows several views of great\\nvalue in picturing the falls of the other ships, and all of the rear\\nprojectoscope records enable the reconstruction in detail of the\\npendulum and torsional movements of the ship, and its sag toward the\\nearth. But none of the views showing the forest below contain any\\nindication of tribesmen\\'s presence. A final explosion put this ship out\\nof commission at a height of 1,000 feet, and at a point four miles S. by\\nE. of the center of the valley.\"\\n\\nThe message ended with a repetition of the warning to other airmen to\\navoid the valley.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nIncredible Treason\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving this report, and reassurances of support from the Big\\nBosses of the neighboring Gangs, Hart determined to reestablish the\\nWyoming Valley community.\\n\\nA careful survey of the territory showed that it was only the northern\\nsections and slopes that had been \"beamed\" by the first Han ship.\\n\\nThe synthetic-fabrics plant had been partially wiped out, though the\\nlower levels underground had not been reached by the dis ray. The forest\\nscreen above it, however, had been annihilated, and it was determined to\\nabandon it, after removing all usable machinery and evidences of the\\nprocesses that might be of interest to the Han scientists, should they\\nreturn to the valley in the future.\\n\\nThe ammunition plant, and the rocket-ship plant, which had just been\\nabout to start operation at the time of the raid, were intact, as were\\nthe other important plants.\\n\\nHart brought the Camboss up from the Susquanna Works, and laid out new\\ncamp locations, scattering them farther to the south, and avoiding\\nground which had been seared by the Han beams and the immediate\\nlocations of the Han wrecks.\\n\\nDuring this period, a sharp check was kept upon Han messages, for the\\nphone plant had been one of the first to be put in operation, and when\\nit became evident that the Hans did not intend any immediate reprisals,\\nthe entire membership of the community was summoned back, and normal\\nlife was resumed.\\n\\nWilma and I had been married the day after the destruction of the ships,\\nand spent this intervening period in a delightful honeymoon, camping\\nhigh in the mountains. On our return, we had a camp of our own, of\\ncourse. We were assigned to location 1017. And as might be expected, we\\nhad a great deal of banter over which one of us was Camp Boss. The title\\nstood after my name on the Big Boss\\' records, and those of the Big\\nCamboss, of course, but Wilma airily held that this meant nothing at\\nall--and generally succeeded in making me admit it whenever she chose.\\n\\nI found myself a full-fledged member of the Gang now, for I had elected\\nto search no farther for a permanent alliance, much as I would have\\nliked to familiarize myself with this 25th Century life in other\\nsections of the country. The Wyomings had a high morale, and had\\nprospered under the rule of Big Boss Hart for many years. But many of\\nthe gangs, I found, were badly organized, lacked strong hands in\\nauthority, and were rife with intrigue. On the whole, I thought I would\\nbe wise to stay with a group which had already proved its friendliness,\\nand in which I seemed to have prospects of advancement. Under these\\nmodern social and economic conditions, the kind of individual freedom to\\nwhich I had been accustomed in the 20th Century was impossible. I would\\nhave been as much of a nonentity in every phase of human relationship by\\nattempting to avoid alliances, as any man of the 20th Century would have\\nbeen politically, who aligned himself with no political party.\\n\\nThis entire modern life, it appeared to me, judging from my ancient\\nviewpoint, was organized along what I called \"political\" lines. And in\\nthis connection, it amused me to notice how universal had become the use\\nof the word \"boss.\" The leader, the person in charge or authority over\\nanything, was a \"boss.\" There was as little formality in his relations\\nwith his followers as there was in the case of the 20th Century\\npolitical boss, and the same high respect paid him by his followers as\\nwell as the same high consideration by him of their interests. He was\\njust as much of an autocrat, and just as much dependent upon the general\\npopularity of his actions for the ability to maintain his autocracy.\\n\\nThe sub-boss who could not command the loyalty of his followers was as\\nquickly deposed, either by them or by his superiors, as the ancient ward\\nleader of the 20th Century who lost control of his votes.\\n\\nAs society was organized in the 20th Century, I do not believe the\\nsystem could have worked in anything but politics. I tremble to think\\nwhat would have happened, had the attempt been made to handle the A. E.\\nF. this way during the First World War, instead of by that rigid\\nmilitary discipline and complete assumption of the individual as a mere\\nstandardized cog in the machine.\\n\\nBut owing to the centuries of desperate suffering the people had endured\\nat the hands of the Hans, there developed a spirit of self-sacrifice and\\nconsideration for the common good that made the scheme applicable and\\nefficient in all forms of human co-operation.\\n\\nI have a little heresy about all this, however. My associates regard the\\nthought with as much horror as many worthy people of the 20th Century\\nfelt in regard to any heretical suggestion that the original outline of\\ngovernment as laid down in the First Constitution did not apply as well\\nto 20th Century conditions as to those of the early 19th.\\n\\nIn later years, I felt that there was a certain softening of moral fiber\\namong the people, since the Hans had been finally destroyed with all\\ntheir works; and Americans have developed a new luxury economy. I have\\nseen signs of the reawakening of greed, of selfishness. The eternal\\ncycle seems to be at work. I fear that slowly, though surely, private\\nwealth is reappearing, codes of inflexibility are developing; they will\\nbe followed by corruption, degradation; and in the end some cataclysmic\\nevent will end this era and usher in a new one.\\n\\nAll this, however, is wandering afar from my story, which concerns our\\nearly battles against the Hans, and not our more modern problems of\\nself-control.\\n\\nOur victory over the seven Han ships had set the country ablaze. The\\nsecret had been carefully communicated to the other gangs, and the\\ncountry was agog from one end to the other. There was feverish activity\\nin the ammunition plants, and the hunting of stray Han ships became an\\nenthusiastic sport. The results were disastrous to our hereditary\\nenemies.\\n\\nFrom the Pacific Coast came the report of a great transpacific liner of\\n75,000 tons \"lift\" being brought to earth from a position of\\ninvisibility above the clouds. A dozen Sacramentos had caught the hazy\\noutlines of its rep rays approaching them, head-on, in the twilight,\\nlike ghostly pillars reaching into the sky. They had fired rockets into\\nit with ease, whereas they would have had difficulty in hitting it if it\\nhad been moving at right angles to their position. They got one rep ray.\\nThe other was not strong enough to hold it up. It floated to earth, nose\\ndown, and since it was unarmed and unarmored, they had no difficulty in\\nshooting it to pieces and massacring its crew and passengers. It seemed\\nbarbarous to me. But then I did not have centuries of bitter persecution\\nin my blood.\\n\\nFrom the Jersey Beaches we received news of the destruction of a\\nNu-yok-A-lan-a liner. The Sand-snipers, practically invisible in their\\nsand-colored clothing, and half buried along the beaches, lay in wait\\nfor days, risking the play of dis beams along the route, and finally\\nregistering four hits within a week. The Hans discontinued their service\\nalong this route, and as evidence that they were badly shaken by our\\nsuccess, sent no raiders down the Beaches.\\n\\nIt was a few weeks later that Big Boss Hart sent for me.\\n\\n\"Tony,\" he said, \"There are two things I want to talk to you about. One\\nof them will become public property in a few days, I think. We aren\\'t\\ngoing to get any more Han ships by shooting up their repellor rays\\nunless we use much larger rockets. They are wise to us now. They\\'re\\nputting armor of great thickness in the hulls of their ships below the\\nrep-ray machines. Near Bah-flo this morning a party of Eries shot one\\nwithout success. The explosions staggered her, but did not penetrate. As\\nnear as we can gather from their reports, their laboratories have\\ndeveloped a new alloy of great tensile strength and elasticity which\\nnevertheless lets the rep rays through like a sieve. Our reports\\nindicate that the Eries\\' rockets bounced off harmlessly. Most of the\\nparty was wiped out as the dis rays went into action on them.\\n\\n\"This is going to mean real business for all of the gangs before long.\\nThe Big Bosses have just held a national ultrophone council. It was\\ndecided that America must organize on a national basis. The first move\\nis to develop sectional organization by Zones. I have been made\\nSuperboss of the Mid-Atlantic Zone.\\n\\n\"We\\'re in for it now. The Hans are sure to launch reprisal expeditions.\\nIf we\\'re to save the race we must keep them away from our camps and\\nplants. I\\'m thinking of developing a permanent field force, along the\\nlines of the regular armies of the 20th Century you told me about. Its\\nbusiness will be twofold: to carry the warfare as much as possible to\\nthe Hans, and to serve as a decoy, to keep their attention from our\\nplants. I\\'m going to need your help in this.\\n\\n\"The other thing I wanted to talk to you about is this: Amazing and\\nimpossible as it seems, there is a group, or perhaps an entire gang,\\nsomewhere among us, that is betraying us to the Hans. It may be the Bad\\nBloods, or it may be one of those gangs who live near one of the Han\\ncities. You know, a hundred and fifteen or twenty years ago there were\\ncertain of these people\\'s ancestors who actually degraded themselves by\\nmating with the Hans, sometimes even serving them as slaves, in the days\\nbefore they brought all their service machinery to perfection.\\n\\n\"There is such a gang, called the Nagras, up near Bah-flo, and another\\nin Mid-Jersey that men call the Pineys. But I hardly suspect the Pineys.\\nThere is little intelligence among them. They wouldn\\'t have the\\ninformation to give the Hans, nor would they be capable of imparting it.\\nThey\\'re absolute savages.\"\\n\\n\"Just what evidence is there that anybody has been clearing information\\nto the Hans?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"first of all there was that raid upon us. That\\nfirst Han ship knew the location of our plants exactly. You remember it\\nfloated directly into position above the valley and began a systematic\\nbeaming. Then, the Hans quite obviously have learned that we are picking\\nup their electrophone waves, for they\\'ve gone back to their old, but\\nextremely accurate, system of directional control. But we\\'ve been\\ngetting them for the past week by installing automatic re-broadcast\\nunits along the scar paths. This is what the Americans called those\\nstrips of country directly under the regular ship routes of the Hans,\\nwho as a matter of precaution frequently blasted them with their dis\\nbeams to prevent the growth of foliage which might give shelter to the\\nAmericans. But they\\'ve been beaming those paths so hard, it looks as\\nthough they even had information of this strategy. And in addition,\\nthey\\'ve been using code. Finally, we\\'ve picked up three of their\\nmessages in which they discuss, with some nervousness, the existence of\\nour \\'mysterious\\' ultrophone.\"\\n\\n\"But they still have no knowledge of the nature and control of ultronic\\nactivity?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the Big Boss thoughtfully, \"they don\\'t seem to have a bit of\\ninformation about it.\"\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s quite clear,\" I ventured, \"that whoever is \\'clearing\\' us to\\nthem is doing it piecemeal. It sounds like a bit of occasional barter,\\nrather than an out-and-out alliance. They\\'re holding back as much\\ninformation as possible for future bartering, perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Hart said, \"and it isn\\'t information the Hans are giving in\\nreturn, but some form of goods, or privilege. The trick would be to\\nlocate the goods. I guess I\\'ll have to make a personal trip around among\\nthe Big Bosses.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nThe Han City\\n\\n\\nThis conversation set me thinking. All of the Han electrophone\\ninter-communication had been an open record to the Americans for a good\\nmany years, and the Hans were just finding it out. For centuries they\\nhad not regarded us as any sort of a menace. Unquestionably it had never\\noccurred to them to secrete their own records. Somewhere in Nu-yok or\\nBah-flo, or possibly in Lo-Tan itself, the record of this traitorous\\ntransaction would be more or less openly filed. If we could only get at\\nit! I wondered if a raid might not be possible.\\n\\nBill Hearn and I talked it over with our Han-affairs Boss and his\\nexperts. There ensued several days of research, in which the Han records\\nof the entire decade were scanned and analyzed. In the end they picked\\nout a mass of detail, and fitted it together into a very definite\\npicture of the great central filing office of the Hans in Nu-yok, where\\nthe entire mass of official records was kept, constantly available for\\ninstant projectoscoping to any of the city\\'s offices, and of the system\\nby which the information was filed.\\n\\nThe attempt began to look feasible, though Hart instantly turned the\\nidea down when I first presented it to him. It was unthinkable, he said.\\nSheer suicide. But in the end I persuaded him.\\n\\n\"I will need,\" I said, \"Blash, who is thoroughly familiar with the Han\\nlibrary system; Bert Gaunt, who for years has specialized on their\\nmilitary offices; Bill Barker, the ray specialist, and the best swooper\\npilot we have.\" _Swoopers_ are one-man and two-man ships, developed by\\nthe Americans, with skeleton backbones of inertron (during the war\\npainted green for invisibility against the green forests below) and\\n\"bellies\" of clear ultron.\\n\\n\"That will be Mort Gibbons,\" said Hart. \"We\\'ve only got three swoopers\\nleft, Tony, but I\\'ll risk one of them if you and the others will\\nvoluntarily risk your existences. But mind, I won\\'t urge or order one of\\nyou to go. I\\'ll spread the word to every Plant Boss at once to give you\\nanything and everything you need in the way of equipment.\"\\n\\nWhen I told Wilma of the plan, I expected her to raise violent and\\ntearful objections, but she didn\\'t. She was made of far sterner stuff\\nthan the women of the 20th Century. Not that she couldn\\'t weep as\\ncopiously or be just as whimsical on occasion; but she wouldn\\'t weep for\\nthe same reasons.\\n\\nShe just gave me an unfathomable look, in which there seemed to be a bit\\nof pride, and asked eagerly for the details. I confess I was somewhat\\ndisappointed that she could so courageously risk my loss, even though I\\nwas amazed at her fortitude. But later I was to learn how little I knew\\nher then.\\n\\nWe were ready to slide off at dawn the next morning. I had kissed Wilma\\ngood-bye at our camp, and after a final conference over our plans, we\\nboarded our craft and gently glided away over the tree tops on a course,\\nwhich, after crossing three routes of the Han ships, would take us out\\nover the Atlantic, off the Jersey coast, whence we would come up on\\nNu-yok from the ocean.\\n\\nTwice we had to nose down and lie motionless on the ground near a route\\nwhile Han ships passed. Those were tense moments. Had the green back of\\nour ship been observed, we would have been disintegrated in a second.\\nBut it wasn\\'t.\\n\\nOnce over the water, however, we climbed in a great spiral, ten miles in\\ndiameter, until our altimeter registered ten miles. Here Gibbons shut\\noff his rocket motor, and we floated, far above the level of the\\nAtlantic liners, whose course was well to the north of us anyhow, and\\nwaited for nightfall.\\n\\nThen Gibbons turned from his control long enough to grin at me.\\n\\n\"I have a surprise for you, Tony,\" he said, throwing back the lid of\\nwhat I had supposed was a big supply case. And with a sigh of relief,\\nWilma stepped out of the case.\\n\\n\"If you \\'go into zero\\' (a common expression of the day for being\\nannihilated by the disintegrator ray), you don\\'t think I\\'m going to let\\nyou go alone, do you, Tony? I couldn\\'t believe my ears last night when\\nyou spoke of going without me, until I realized that you are still five\\nhundred years behind the times in lots of ways. Don\\'t you know, dear\\nheart, that you offered me the greatest insult a husband could give a\\nwife? You didn\\'t, of course.\"\\n\\nThe others, it seemed, had all been in on the secret, and now they would\\nhave kidded me unmercifully, except that Wilma\\'s eyes blazed\\ndangerously.\\n\\nAt nightfall, we maneuvered to a position directly above the city. This\\ntook some time and calculation on the part of Bill Barker, who explained\\nto me that he had to determine our point by ultronic bearings. The\\nslightest resort to an electronic instrument, he feared, might be\\ndetected by our enemies\\' locators. In fact, we did not dare bring our\\nswooper any lower than five miles for fear that its capacity might be\\nreflected in their instruments.\\n\\nFinally, however, he succeeded in locating above the central tower of\\nthe city.\\n\\n\"If my calculations are as much as ten feet off,\" he remarked with\\nconfidence, \"I\\'ll eat the tower. Now the rest is up to you, Mort. See\\nwhat you can do to hold her steady. No--here, watch this indicator--the\\nred beam, not the green one. See--if you keep it exactly centered on the\\nneedle, you\\'re O.K. The width of the beam represents seventeen feet. The\\ntower platform is fifty feet square, so we\\'ve got a good margin to work\\non.\"\\n\\nFor several moments we watched as Gibbons bent over his levers,\\nconstantly adjusting them with deft touches of his fingers. After a bit\\nof wavering, the beam remained centered on the needle.\\n\\n\"Now,\" I said, \"let\\'s drop.\"\\n\\nI opened the trap and looked down, but quickly shut it again when I felt\\nthe air rushing out of the ship into the rarefied atmosphere in a\\ntorrent. Gibbons literally yelled a protest from his instrument board.\\n\\n\"I forgot,\" I mumbled. \"Silly of me. Of course, we\\'ll have to drop out\\nof compartment.\"\\n\\nThe compartment, to which I referred, was similar to those in some of\\nthe 20th Century submarines. We all entered it. There was barely room\\nfor us to stand, shoulder to shoulder. With some struggles, we got into\\nour special air helmets and adjusted the pressure. At our signal,\\nGibbons exhausted the air in the compartment, pumping it into the body\\nof the ship, and as the little signal light flashed, Wilma threw open\\nthe hatch.\\n\\nSetting the ultron-wire reel, I climbed through, and began to slide down\\ngently.\\n\\nWe all had our belts on, of course, adjusted to a weight balance of but\\na few ounces. And the five-mile reel of ultron wire that was to be our\\nguide, was of gossamer fineness, though, anyway, I believe it would have\\nlifted the full weight of the five of us, so strong and tough was this\\ninvisible metal. As an extra precaution, since the wire was of the\\npurest metal, and therefore totally invisible, even in daylight, we all\\nhad our belts hooked on small rings that slid down the wire.\\n\\nI went down with the end of the wire. Wilma followed a few feet above\\nme, then Barker, Gaunt and Blash. Gibbons, of course, stayed behind to\\nhold the ship in position and control the paying out of the line. We all\\nhad our ultrophones in place inside our air helmets, and so could\\nconverse with one another and with Gibbons. But at Wilma\\'s suggestion,\\nalthough we would have liked to let the Big Boss listen in, we kept them\\nadjusted to short-range work, for fear that those who had been clearing\\nwith the Hans, and against whom we were on a raid for evidence, might\\nalso pick up our conversation. We had no fear that the Hans would hear\\nus. In fact, we had the added advantage that, even after we landed, we\\ncould converse freely without danger of their hearing our voices through\\nour air helmets.\\n\\nFor a while I could see nothing below but utter darkness. Then I\\nrealized, from the feel of the air as much as from anything, that we\\nwere sinking through a cloud layer. We passed through two more cloud\\nlayers before anything was visible to us.\\n\\nThen there came under my gaze, about two miles below, one of the most\\nbeautiful sights I have ever seen; the soft, yet brilliant, radiance of\\nthe great Han city of Nu-yok. Every foot of its structural members\\nseemed to glow with a wonderful incandescence, tower piled up on tower,\\nand all built on the vast base-mass of the city, which, so I had been\\ntold, sheered upward from the surface of the rivers to a height of 728\\nlevels.\\n\\nThe city, I noticed with some surprise, did not cover anything like the\\nsame area as the New York of the 20th Century. It occupied, as a matter\\nof fact, only the lower half of Manhattan Island, with one section\\nstraddling the East River, and spreading out sufficiently over what once\\nhad been Brooklyn, to provide berths for the great liners and other air\\ncraft.\\n\\nStraight beneath my feet was a tiny dark patch. It seemed the only spot\\nin the entire city that was not aflame with radiance. This was the\\ncentral tower, in the top floors of which were housed the vast library\\nof record files and the main projectoscope plant.\\n\\n\"You can shoot the wire now,\" I ultrophoned Gibbons, and let go the\\nlittle weighted knob. It dropped like a plummet, and we followed with\\nconsiderable speed, but braking our descent with gloved hands\\nsufficiently to see whether the knob, on which a faint light glowed as a\\nsignal for ourselves, might be observed by any Han guard or night\\nprowler. Apparently it was not, and we again shot down with accelerated\\nspeed.\\n\\nWe landed on the roof of the tower without any mishap, and fortunately\\nfor our plan, in darkness. Since there was nothing above it on which it\\nwould have been worth while to shed illumination, or from which there\\nwas any need to observe it, the Hans had neglected to light the tower\\nroof, or indeed to occupy it at all. This was the reason we had selected\\nit as our landing place.\\n\\nAs soon as Gibbons had our word, he extinguished the knob light, and the\\nknob, as well as the wire, became totally invisible. At our ultrophoned\\nword, he would light it again.\\n\\n\"No gun play now,\" I warned. \"Swords only, and then only if absolutely\\nnecessary.\"\\n\\nClosely bunched, and treading as lightly as only inertron-belted people\\ncould, we made our way cautiously through a door and down an inclined\\nplane to the floor below, where Gaunt and Blash assured us the military\\noffices were located.\\n\\nTwice Barker cautioned us to stop as we were about to pass in front of\\nmirror-like \"windows\" in the passage wall, and flattening ourselves to\\nthe floor, we crawled past them.\\n\\n\"Projectoscopes,\" he said. \"Probably on automatic record only, at this\\ntime of night. Still, we don\\'t want to leave any records for them to\\nstudy after we\\'re gone.\"\\n\\n\"Were you ever here before?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but I haven\\'t been studying their electrophone\\ncommunications for seven years without being able to recognize these\\nmachines when I run across them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nThe Fight in the Tower\\n\\n\\nSo far we had not laid eyes on a Han. The tower seemed deserted. Blash\\nand Gaunt, however, assured me that there would be at least one man on\\n\"duty\" in the military offices, though he would probably be asleep, and\\ntwo or three in the library proper and the projectoscope plant.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to put them out of commission,\" I said. \"Did you bring the\\n\\'dope\\' cans, Wilma?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"two for each. Here,\" and she distributed them.\\n\\nWe were now two levels below the roof, and at the point where we were to\\nseparate.\\n\\nI did not want to let Wilma out of my sight, but it was necessary.\\n\\nAccording to our plan, Barker was to make his way to the projectoscope\\nplant, Blash and I to the library, and Wilma and Gaunt to the military\\noffice.\\n\\nBlash and I traversed a long corridor, and paused at the great arched\\ndoorway of the library. Cautiously we peered in. Seated at three great\\nswitchboards were library operatives. Occasionally one of them would\\nreach lazily for a lever, or sleepily push a button, as little numbered\\nlights winked on and off. They were answering calls for electrograph and\\nviewplate records on all sorts of subjects from all sections of the\\ncity.\\n\\nI apprised my companions of the situation.\\n\\n\"Better wait a bit,\" Blash added. \"The calls will lessen shortly.\"\\n\\nWilma reported an officer in the military office sound asleep.\\n\\n\"Give him the can, then,\" I said.\\n\\nBarker was to do nothing more than keep watch in the projectoscope\\nplant, and a few moments later he reported himself well concealed, with\\na splendid view of the floor.\\n\\n\"I think we can take a chance now,\" Blash said to me, and at my nod, he\\nopened the lid of his dope can. Of course, the fumes did not affect us,\\nthrough our helmets. They were absolutely without odor or visibility,\\nand in a few seconds the librarians were unconscious. We stepped into\\nthe room.\\n\\nThere ensued considerable cautious observation and experiment on the\\npart of Gaunt, working from the military office, and Blash in the\\nlibrary; while Wilma and I, with drawn swords and sharply attuned\\nmicrophones, stood guard, and occasionally patrolled nearby corridors.\\n\\n\"I hear something approaching,\" Wilma said after a bit, with excitement\\nin her voice. \"It\\'s a soft, gliding sound.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s an elevator somewhere,\" Barker cut in from the projectoscope\\nfloor. \"Can you locate it? I can\\'t hear it.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s to the east of me,\" she replied.\\n\\n\"And to my west,\" said I, faintly catching it. \"It\\'s between us, Wilma,\\nand nearer you than me. Be careful. Have you got any information yet,\\nBlash and Gaunt?\"\\n\\n\"Getting it now,\" one of them replied. \"Give us two minutes more.\"\\n\\n\"Keep at it then,\" I said. \"We\\'ll guard.\"\\n\\nThe soft, gliding sound ceased.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s very close to me,\" Wilma almost whispered. \"Come closer,\\nTony. I have a feeling something is going to happen. I\\'ve never known my\\nnerves to get taut like this without reason.\"\\n\\nIn some alarm, I launched myself down the corridor in a great leap\\ntoward the intersection whence I knew I could see her.\\n\\nIn the middle of my leap my ultrophone registered her gasp of alarm. The\\nnext instant I glided to a stop at the intersection to see Wilma backing\\ntoward the door of the military office, her sword red with blood, and an\\ninert form on the corridor floor. Two other Hans were circling to either\\nside of her with wicked-looking knives, while a third evidently a high\\nofficer, judging by the resplendence of his garb tugged desperately to\\nget an electrophone instrument out of a bulky pocket. If he ever gave\\nthe alarm, there was no telling what might happen to us.\\n\\nI was at least seventy feet away, but I crouched low and sprang with\\nevery bit of strength in my legs. It would be more correct to say that I\\ndived, for I reached the fellow head on, with no attempt to draw my legs\\nbeneath me.\\n\\nSome instinct must have warned him, for he turned suddenly as I hurtled\\nclose to him. But by this time I had sunk close to the floor, and had\\nstiffened myself rigidly, lest a dragging knee or foot might just\\nprevent my reaching him. I brought my blade upward and over. It was a\\nvicious slash that laid him open, bisecting him from groin to chin, and\\nhis dead body toppled down on me, as I slid to a tangled stop.\\n\\nThe other two startled, turned. Wilma leaped at one and struck him down\\nwith a side slash. I looked up at this instant, and the dazed fear on\\nhis face at the length of her leap registered vividly. The Hans knew\\nnothing of our inertron belts, it seemed, and these leaps and dives of\\nours filled them with terror.\\n\\nAs I rose to my feet, a gory mess, Wilma, with a poise and speed which I\\nfound time to admire even in this crisis, again leaped. This time she\\ndove head first as I had done and, with a beautifully executed thrust,\\nran the last Han through the throat.\\n\\nUncertainly, she scrambled to her feet, staggered queerly, and then sank\\ngently prone on the corridor. She had fainted.\\n\\nAt this juncture, Blash and Gaunt reported with elation that they had\\nthe record we wanted.\\n\\n\"Back to the roof, everybody!\" I ordered, as I picked Wilma up in my\\narms. With her inertron belt, she felt as light as a feather.\\n\\nGaunt joined me at once from the military office, and at the\\nintersection of the corridor, we came upon Blash waiting for us. Barker,\\nhowever, was not in evidence.\\n\\n\"Where are you, Barker?\" I called.\\n\\n\"Go ahead,\" he replied. \"I\\'ll be with you on the roof at once.\"\\n\\nWe came out in the open without any further mishap, and I instructed\\nGibbons in the ship to light the knob on the end of the ultron wire. It\\nflashed dully a few feet away from us. Just how he had maneuvered the\\nship to keep our end of the line in position, without its swinging in a\\ntremendous arc, I have never been able to understand. Had not the night\\nbeen an unusually still one, he could not have checked the initial\\npendulum-like movements. As it was, there was considerable air current\\nat certain of the levels, and in different directions too. But Gibbons\\nwas an expert of rare ability and sensitivity in the handling of a\\nrocket ship, and he managed, with the aid of his delicate instruments,\\nto sense the drifts almost before they affected the fine ultron wire,\\nand to neutralize them with little shifts in the position of the ship.\\n\\nBlash and Gaunt fastened their rings to the wire, and I hooked my own\\nand Wilma\\'s on, too. But on looking around, I found Barker was still\\nmissing.\\n\\n\"Barker, come!\" I called. \"We\\'re waiting.\"\\n\\n\"Coming!\" he replied, and indeed, at that instant, his figure appeared\\nup the ramp. He chuckled as he fastened his ring to the wire, and said\\nsomething about a little surprise he had left for the Hans.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t reel in the wire more than a few hundred feet,\" I instructed\\nGibbons. \"It will take too long to wind it in. We\\'ll float up, and when\\nwe\\'re aboard, we can drop it.\"\\n\\nIn order to float up, we had to dispense with a pound or two of weight\\napiece. We hurled our swords from us, and kicked off our shoes as\\nGibbons reeled up the line a bit, and then letting go of the wire, began\\nto hum upward on our rings with increasing velocity.\\n\\nThe rush of air brought Wilma to, and I hastily explained to her that we\\nhad been successful. Receding far below us now, I could see our dully\\nshining knob swinging to and fro in an ever widening arc, as it crossed\\nand recrossed the black square of the tower roof. As an extra\\nprecaution, I ordered Gibbons to shut off the light, and to show one\\nfrom the belly of the ship, for so great was our speed now, that I began\\nto fear we would have difficulty in checking ourselves. We were\\nliterally falling upward, and with terrific acceleration.\\n\\nFortunately, we had several minutes in which to solve this difficulty,\\nwhich none of us, strangely enough, had foreseen. It was Gibbons who\\nfound the answer.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be all right if all of you grab the wire tight when I give the\\nword,\" he said. \"First I\\'ll start reeling it in at full speed. You won\\'t\\nget much of a jar, and then I\\'ll decrease its speed again gradually, and\\nits weight will hold you back. Are you ready? One--two--three!\"\\n\\nWe all grabbed tightly with our gloved hands as he gave the word. We\\nmust have been rising a good bit faster than he figured, however, for it\\nwrenched our arms considerably, and the maneuver set up a sickening\\npendulum motion.\\n\\nFor a while all we could do was swing there in an arc that may have been\\na quarter of a mile across, about three and a half miles above the city,\\nand still more than a mile from our ship.\\n\\nGibbons skilfully took up the slack as our momentum pulled up the line.\\nThen at last we had ourselves under control again, and continued our\\nupward journey, checking our speed somewhat with our gloves.\\n\\nThere was not one of us who did not breathe a big sigh of relief when we\\nscrambled through the hatch safely into the ship again, cast off the\\nultron line and slammed the trap shut.\\n\\nLittle realizing that we had a still more terrible experience to go\\nthrough, we discussed the information Blash and Gaunt had between them\\nextracted from the Han records, and the advisability of ultrophoning\\nHart at once.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nThe Walls of Hell\\n\\n\\nThe traitors were, it seemed, a degenerate gang of Americans, located a\\nfew miles north of Nu-yok on the wooded banks of the Hudson, the\\nSinsings. They had exchanged scraps of information to the Hans in return\\nfor several old repellor-ray machines, and the privilege of tuning in on\\nthe Han electronic power broadcast for their operation, provided their\\nships agreed to subject themselves to the orders of the Han traffic\\noffice, while aloft.\\n\\nThe rest wanted to ultrophone their news at once, since there was always\\ndanger that we might never get back to the gang with it.\\n\\nI objected, however. The Sinsings would be likely to pick up our\\nmessage. Even if we used the directional projector, they might have\\nscouts out to the west and south in the big inter-gang stretches of\\ncountry. They would flee to Nu-yok and escape the punishment they\\nmerited. It seemed to be vitally important that they should not, for the\\nsake of example to other weak groups among the American gangs, as well\\nas to prevent a crisis in which they might clear more vital information\\nto the enemy.\\n\\n\"Out to sea again,\" I ordered Gibbons. \"They\\'ll be less likely to look\\nfor us in that direction.\"\\n\\n\"Easy, Boss, easy,\" he replied. \"Wait until we get up a mile or two\\nmore. They must have discovered evidences of our raid by now, and their\\ndis-ray wall may go in operation any moment.\"\\n\\nEven as he spoke, the ship lurched downward and to one side.\\n\\n\"There it is!\" he shouted. \"Hang on, everybody. We\\'re going to nose\\nstraight up!\" And he flipped the rocket-motor control wide open.\\n\\nLooking through one of the rear ports, I could see a nebulous, luminous\\nring, and on all sides the atmosphere took on a faint iridescence.\\n\\nWe were almost over the destructive range of the disintegrator-ray wall,\\na hollow cylinder of annihilation shooting upward from a solid ring of\\ngenerators surrounding the city. It was the main defense system of the\\nHans, which had never been used except in periodic tests. They may or\\nmay not have suspected that an American rocket ship was within the\\ncylinder; probably they had turned on their generators more as a\\nprecaution to prevent any reaching a position above the city.\\n\\nBut even at our present great height, we were in great danger. It was a\\nquestion how much we might have been harmed by the rays themselves, for\\ntheir effective range was not much more than seven or eight miles. The\\ngreater danger lay in the terrific downward rush of air within the\\ncylinder to replace that which was being burned into nothingness by the\\ncontinual play of the disintegrators. The air fell into the cylinder\\nwith the force of a gale. It would be rushing toward the wall from the\\noutside with terrific force also, but, naturally, the effect was\\nintensified on the interior.\\n\\nOur ship vibrated and trembled. We had only one chance of escape--to\\nfight our way well above the current. To drift down with it meant\\nultimately, and inevitably, to be sucked into the destruction wall at\\nsome lower level.\\n\\nBut very gradually and jerkily our upward movement, as shown on the\\nindicators, began to increase, and after an hour of desperate struggle\\nwe were free of the maelstrom and into the rarefied upper levels. The\\nterror beneath us was now invisible through several layers of cloud\\nformations.\\n\\nGibbons brought the ship back to an even keel, and drove her eastward\\ninto one of the most brilliantly gorgeous sunrises I have ever seen.\\n\\nWe described a great circle to the south and west, in a long easy dive,\\nfor he had cut out his rocket motors to save them as much as possible.\\nWe had drawn terrifically on their fuel reserves in our battle with the\\nelements. For the moment, the atmosphere below cleared, and we could see\\nthe Jersey coast far beneath, like a great map.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not through yet,\" remarked Gibbons suddenly, pointing at his\\nperiscope, and adjusting it to telescopic focus. \"A Han ship, and a\\n\\'drop ship\\' at that--and he\\'s seen us. If he whips that beam of his on\\nus, we\\'re done.\"\\n\\nI gazed, fascinated, at the viewplate. What I saw was a cigar-shaped\\nship not dissimilar to our own in design, and from the proportional size\\nof its ports, of about the same size as our swoopers. We learned later\\nthat they carried crews, for the most part of not more than three or\\nfour men. They had streamline hulls and tails that embodied\\nuniversal-jointed double fish-tail rudders. In operation they rose to\\ngreat heights on their powerful repellor rays, then gathered speed\\neither by a straight nose dive, or an inclined dive in which they\\nsometimes used the repellor ray slanted at a sharp angle. He was already\\nabove us, though several miles to the north. He could, of course, try to\\nget on our tail and \"spear\" us with his beam as he dropped at us from a\\ngreat height.\\n\\nSuddenly his beam blazed forth in a blinding flash, whipping downward\\nslowly to our right. He went through a peculiar corkscrew-like\\nevolution, evidently maneuvering to bring his beam to bear on us with a\\nspiral motion.\\n\\nGibbons instantly sent our ship into a series of evolutions that must\\nhave looked like those of a frightened hen. Alternately, he used the\\nforward and the reverse rocket blasts, and in varying degree. We\\nfluttered, we shot suddenly to right and left, and dropped like a\\nplummet in uncertain movements. But all the time the Han scout dropped\\ntoward us, determinedly whipping the air around us with his beam. Once\\nit sliced across beneath us, not more than a hundred feet, and we\\ndropped with a jar into the pocket formed by the destruction of the air.\\n\\nHe had dropped to within a mile of us, and was coming with the speed of\\na projectile, when the end came. Gibbons always swore it was sheer luck.\\nMaybe it was, but I like pilots who are lucky that way.\\n\\nIn the midst of a dizzy, fluttering maneuver of our own, with the Han\\nship enlarging to our gaze with terrifying rapidity, and its beam slowly\\nslicing toward us in what looked like certain destruction within the\\nsecond, I saw Gibbons\\' fingers flick at the lever of his rocket gun and\\na split second later the Han ship flew apart like a clay pigeon.\\n\\nWe staggered, and fluttered crazily for several moments while Gibbons\\nstruggled to bring our ship into balance, and a section of about four\\nsquare feet in the side of the ship near the stern slowly crumbled like\\nrusted metal. His beam actually had touched us, but our explosive rocket\\nhad got him a thousandth of a second sooner.\\n\\nPart of our rudder had been annihilated, and our motor damaged. But we\\nwere able to swoop gently back across Jersey, fortunately crossing the\\nship lanes without sighting any more Han craft, and finally settling to\\nrest in the little glade beneath the trees, near Hart\\'s camp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nThe New Boss\\n\\n\\nWe had ultrophoned our arrival and the Big Boss himself, surrounded by\\nthe Council, was on hand to welcome us and learn our news. In turn we\\nwere informed that during the night a band of raiding Bad Bloods,\\ndisguised under the insignia of the Altoonas, a gang some distance to\\nthe west of us, had destroyed several of our camps before our people had\\nrallied and driven them off. Their purpose, evidently, had been to\\nembroil us with the Altoonas, but fortunately, one of our exchanges\\nrecognized the Bad Blood leader, who had been slain.\\n\\nThe Big Boss had mobilized the full raiding force of the Gang, and was\\non the point of heading an expedition for the extermination of the Bad\\nBloods.\\n\\nI looked around the grim circle of the sub-bosses, and realized the fate\\nof America, at this moment, lay in their hands. Their temper demanded\\nthe immediate expenditure of our full effort in revenging ourselves for\\nthis raid. But the strategic exigencies, to my mind, quite clearly\\ndemanded the instant and absolute extermination of the Sinsings. It\\nmight be only a matter of hours, for all we knew, before these degraded\\npeople would barter clues to the American ultronic secrets to the Hans.\\n\\n\"How large a force have we?\" I asked Hart.\\n\\n\"Every man and maid who can be spared,\" he replied. \"That gives us seven\\nhundred married and unmarried men, and three hundred girls, more than\\nthe entire Bad Blood Gang. Every one is equipped with belts,\\nultrophones, rocket guns and swords, and all fighting mad.\"\\n\\nI meditated how I might put the matter to these determined men, and was\\nvaguely conscious that they were awaiting my words.\\n\\nFinally I began to speak. I do not remember to this day just what I\\nsaid. I talked calmly, with due regard for their passion, but with deep\\nconviction. I went over the information we had collected, point by\\npoint, building my case logically, and painting a lurid picture of the\\ndanger impending in that half-alliance between the Sinsings and the Hans\\nof Nu-yok. I became impassioned, culminating, I believe, with a vow to\\nproceed single-handed against the hereditary enemies of our race, \"if\\nthe Wyomings were blindly set on placing a gang feud ahead of honor and\\nduty and the hopes of all America.\"\\n\\nAs I concluded, a great calm came over me, as of one detached. I had\\nfelt much the same way during several crises in the First World War. I\\ngazed from face to face, striving to read their expressions, and in a\\nmood to make good my threat without any further heroics, if the decision\\nwas against me.\\n\\nBut it was Hart who sensed the temper of the Council more quickly than I\\ndid, and looked beyond it into the future.\\n\\nHe arose from the tree trunk on which he had been sitting.\\n\\n\"That settles it,\" he said, looking around the ring. \"I have felt this\\nthing coming on for some time now. I\\'m sure the Council agrees with me\\nthat there is among us a man more capable than I, to boss the Wyoming\\nGang, despite his handicap of having had all too short a time in which\\nto familiarize himself with our modern ways and facilities. Whatever I\\ncan do to support his effective leadership, at any cost, I pledge myself\\nto do.\"\\n\\nAs he concluded, he advanced to where I stood, and taking from his head\\nthe green-crested helmet that constituted his badge of office, to my\\nsurprise he placed it in my mechanically extended hand.\\n\\nThe roar of approval that went up from the Council members left me\\ndazed. Somebody ultrophoned the news to the rest of the Gang, and even\\nthough the earflaps of my helmet were turned up, I could hear the cheers\\nwith which my invisible followers greeted me, from near and distant\\nhillsides, camps and plants.\\n\\nMy first move was to make sure that the Phone Boss, in communicating\\nthis news to the members of the Gang, had not re-broadcast my talk nor\\nmentioned my plan of shifting the attack from the Bad Bloods to the\\nSinsings. I was relieved by his assurance that he had not, for it would\\nhave wrecked the whole plan. Everything depended upon our ability to\\nsurprise the Sinsings.\\n\\nSo I pledged the Council and my companions to secrecy, and allowed it to\\nbe believed that we were about to take to the air and the trees against\\nthe Bad Bloods.\\n\\nThat outfit must have been badly scared, the way they were \"burning\" the\\nether with ultrophone alibis and propaganda for the benefit of the more\\ndistant gangs. It was their old game, and the only method by which they\\nhad avoided extermination long ago from their immediate neighbors--these\\nappeals to the spirit of American brotherhood, addressed to gangs too\\nfar away to have had the sort of experience with them that had fallen to\\nour lot.\\n\\nI chuckled. Here was another good reason for the shift in my plans. Were\\nwe actually to undertake the exterminations of the Bad Bloods at once,\\nit would have been a hard job to convince some of the gangs that we had\\nnot been precipitate and unjustified. Jealousies and prejudices existed.\\nThere were gangs which would give the benefit of the doubt to the Bad\\nBloods, rather than to ourselves, and the issue was now hopelessly\\nbeclouded with the clever lies that were being broadcast in an unceasing\\nstream.\\n\\nBut the extermination of the Sinsings would be another thing. In the\\nfirst place, there would be no warning of our action until it was all\\nover, I hoped. In the second place, we would have indisputable proof, in\\nthe form of their rep-ray ships and other paraphernalia, of their\\ntraffic with the Hans; and the state of American prejudice, at the time\\nof which I write held trafficking with the Hans a far more heinous thing\\nthan even a vicious gang feud.\\n\\nI called an executive session of the Council at once. I wanted to\\ninventory our military resources.\\n\\nI created a new office on the spot, that of \"Control Boss,\" and\\nappointed Ned Garlin to the post, turning over his former responsibility\\nas Plants Boss to his assistant. I needed someone, I felt, to tie in the\\nrecords of the various functional activities of the campaign, and take\\nover from me the task of keeping the records of them up to the minute.\\n\\nI received reports from the bosses of the ultrophone unit, and those of\\nfood, transportation, fighting gear, chemistry, electronic activity and\\nelectrophone intelligence, ultroscopes, air patrol and contact guard.\\n\\nMy ideas for the campaign, of course, were somewhat tinged with my 20th\\nCentury experience, and I found myself faced with the task of working\\nout a staff organization that was a composite of the best and most\\neasily applied principles of business and military efficiency, as I knew\\nthem from the viewpoint of immediate practicality.\\n\\nWhat I wanted was an organization that would be specialized,\\nfunctionally, not as that indicated above, but from the angles of:\\nintelligence as to the Sinsings\\' activities; intelligence as to Han\\nactivities; perfection of communication with my own units; co-operation\\nof field command; and perfect mobilization of emergency supplies and\\nresources.\\n\\nIt took several hours of hard work with the Council to map out the plan.\\nFirst we assigned functional experts and equipment to each \"Division\" in\\naccordance with its needs. Then these in turn were reassigned by the new\\nDivision Bosses to the Field Commands as needed, or as Independent or\\nHeadquarters Units. The two intelligence divisions were named the White\\nand the Yellow, indicating that one specialized on the American enemy\\nand the other on the Mongolians.\\n\\nThe division in charge of our own communications, the assignment of\\nultrophone frequencies and strengths, and the maintenance of operators\\nand equipment, I called \"Communications.\"\\n\\nI named Bill Hearn to the post of Field Boss, in charge of the main or\\nundetached fighting units, and to the Resources Division, I assigned all\\nresponsibility for what few aircraft we had; and all transportation and\\nsupply problems, I assigned to \"Resources.\" The functional bosses stayed\\nwith this division.\\n\\nWe finally completed our organization with the assignment of liaison\\nrepresentatives among the various divisions as needed.\\n\\nThus I had a \"Headquarters Staff\" composed of the Division Bosses who\\nreported directly to Ned Garlin as Control Boss, or to Wilma as my\\npersonal assistant. And each of the Division Bosses had a small staff of\\nhis own.\\n\\nIn the final summing up of our personnel and resources, I found we had\\nroughly a thousand \"troops,\" of whom some three hundred and fifty were,\\nin what I called the Service Divisions, the rest being in Bill Hearn\\'s\\nField Division. This latter number, however, was cut down somewhat by\\nthe assignment of numerous small units to detached service. Altogether,\\nthe actual available fighting force, I figured, would number about five\\nhundred, by the time we actually went into action.\\n\\nWe had only six small swoopers, but I had an ingenious plan in my mind,\\nas the result of our little raid on Nu-yok, that would make this\\nsufficient, since the reserves of inertron blocks were larger than I\\nexpected to find them. The Resources Division, by packing its supply\\ncases a bit tight, or by slipping in extra blocks of inertron, was able\\nto reduce each to a weight of a few ounces. These easily could be\\nfloated and towed by the swoopers in any quantity. Hitched to ultron\\nlines, it would be a virtual impossibility for them to break loose.\\n\\nThe entire personnel, of course, was supplied with jumpers, and if each\\nman and girl was careful to adjust balances properly, the entire number\\ncould also be towed along through the air, grasping wires of ultron,\\nswinging below the swoopers, or stringing out behind them.\\n\\nThere would be nothing tiring about this, because the strain would be no\\ngreater than that of carrying a one or two pound weight in the hand,\\nexcept for air friction at high speeds. But to make doubly sure that we\\nshould lose none of our personnel, I gave strict orders that the belts\\nand tow lines should be equipped with rings and hooks.\\n\\nSo great was the efficiency of the fundamental organization and\\ndiscipline of the Gang, that we got under way at nightfall.\\n\\nOne by one the swoopers eased into the air, each followed by its long\\ntrain or \"kite-tail\" of humanity and supply cases hanging lightly from\\nits tow line. For convenience, the tow lines were made of an alloy of\\nultron which, unlike the metal itself, is visible.\\n\\nAt first these \"tails\" hung downward, but as the ships swung into\\nformation and headed eastward toward the Bad Blood territory, gathering\\nspeed, they began to string out behind. And swinging low from each ship\\non heavily weighted lines, ultroscope, ultrophone, and straight-vision\\nobservers keenly scanned the countryside, while intelligence men in the\\nswoopers above bent over their instrument boards and viewplates.\\n\\nLeaving Control Boss Ned Garlin temporarily in charge of affairs, Wilma\\nand I dropped a weighted line from our ship, and slid down about half\\nway to the under lookouts, that is to say, about a thousand feet. The\\nsensation of floating swiftly through the air like this, in the absolute\\nsecurity of one\\'s confidence in the inertron belt, was one of\\nnever-ending delight to me.\\n\\nWe reascended into the swooper as the expedition approached the\\nterritory of the Bad Bloods, and directed the preparations for the\\nbombardment. It was part of my plan to appear to carry out the attack as\\noriginally planned.\\n\\nAbout fifteen miles from their camps our ships came to a halt and\\nmaintained their positions for a while with the idling blasts of their\\nrocket motors, to give the ultroscope operators a chance to make a\\nthorough examination of the territory below us, for it was very\\nimportant that this next step in our program should be carried out with\\nall secrecy.\\n\\nAt length they reported the ground below us entirely clear of any\\nappearance of human occupation, and a gun unit of long-range specialists\\nwas lowered with a dozen rocket guns, equipped with special automatic\\ndevices that the Resources Division had developed at my request, a few\\nhours before our departure. These were aiming and timing devices. After\\ncalculating the range, elevation and rocket charges carefully, the guns\\nwere left, concealed in a ravine, and the men were hauled up into the\\nship again. At the predetermined hour, those unmanned rocket guns would\\nbegin automatically to bombard the Bad Bloods\\' hillsides, shifting their\\naim and elevation slightly with each shot, as did many of our artillery\\npieces in the First World War.\\n\\nIn the meantime, we turned south about twenty miles, and grounded,\\nwaiting for the bombardment to begin before we attempted to sneak across\\nthe Han ship lane. I was relying for security on the distraction that\\nthe bombardment might furnish the Han observers.\\n\\nIt was tense work waiting, but the affair went through as planned, our\\nsquadron drifting across the route high enough to enable the ships\\'\\ntails of troops and supply cases to clear the ground.\\n\\nIn crossing the second ship route, out along the Beaches of Jersey, we\\nwere not so successful in escaping observation. A Han ship came speeding\\nalong at a very low elevation. We caught it on our electronic location\\nand direction finders, and also located it with our ultroscopes, but it\\ncame so fast and so low that I thought it best to remain where we had\\ngrounded the second time, and lie quiet, rather than get under way and\\ncross in front of it.\\n\\nThe point was this. While the Hans had no such devices as our\\nultroscopes, with which we could see in the dark (within certain\\nlimitations of course), and their electronic instruments would be\\nvirtually useless in uncovering our presence, since all but natural\\nelectronic activities were carefully eliminated from our apparatus,\\nexcept electrophone receivers (which are not easily spotted), the Hans\\ndid have some very highly sensitive sound devices which operated with\\ngreat efficiency in calm weather, so far as sounds emanating from the\\nair were concerned. But the \"ground roar\" greatly confused their use of\\nthese instruments in the location of specific sounds floating up from\\nthe surface of the earth.\\n\\nThis ship must have caught some slight noise of ours, however, in its\\nsensitive instruments, for we heard its electronic devices go into play,\\nand picked up the routine report of the noise to its Base Ship\\nCommander. But from the nature of the conversation, I judged they had\\nnot identified it, and were, in fact, more curious about the detonations\\nthey were picking up now from the Bad Blood lands some sixty miles or so\\nto the west.\\n\\nImmediately after this ship had shot by, we took the air again, and\\nfollowing much the same route that I had taken the previous night,\\nclimbed in a long semi-circle out over the ocean, swung toward the north\\nand finally the west. We set our course, however, for the Sinsings\\' land\\nnorth of Nu-yok, instead of for the city itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nThe Finger of Doom\\n\\n\\nAs we crossed the Hudson River, a few miles north of the city, we\\ndropped several units of the Yellow Intelligence Division, with full\\ninstrumental equipment. Their apparatus cases were nicely balanced at\\nonly a few ounces weight each, and the men used their chute capes to\\nease their drops.\\n\\nWe recrossed the river a little distance above and began dropping White\\nIntelligence units and a few long and short range gun units. Then we\\nheld our position until we began to get reports. Gradually we ringed the\\nterritory of the Sinsings, our observation units working busily and\\npatiently at their locators and scopes, both aloft and aground, until\\nGarlin finally turned to me with the remark:\\n\\n\"The map circle is complete now, Boss. We\\'ve got clear locations all the\\nway around them.\"\\n\\n\"Let me see it,\" I replied, and studied the illuminated viewplate map,\\nwith its little overlapping circles of light that indicated spots proved\\nclear of the enemy by ultroscopic observation.\\n\\nI nodded to Bill Hearn. \"Go ahead now, Hearn,\" I said, \"and place your\\nbarrage men.\"\\n\\nHe spoke into his ultrophone, and three of the ships began to glide in a\\nwide ring around the enemy territory. Every few seconds, at the word\\nfrom his Unit Boss, a gunner would drop off the wire, and slipping the\\nclasp of his chute cape, drift down into the darkness below.\\n\\nBill formed two lines, parallel to and facing the river, and enclosing\\nthe entire territory of the enemy between them. Above and below,\\nstraddling the river, were two defensive lines. These latter were merely\\nto hold their positions. The others were to close in toward each other,\\npushing a high-explosive barrage five miles ahead of them. When the two\\nbarrages met, both lines were to switch to short-vision-range barrage\\nand continue to close in on any of the enemy who might have drifted\\nthrough the previous curtain of fire.\\n\\nIn the meantime Bill kept his reserves, a picked corps of a hundred men\\n(the same that had accompanied Hart and myself in our fight with the Han\\nsquadron) in the air, divided about equally among the \"kite-tails\" of\\nfour ships.\\n\\nA final roll call, by units, companies, divisions and functions,\\nestablished the fact that all our forces were in position. No Han\\nactivity was reported, and no Han broadcasts indicated any suspicion of\\nour expedition. Nor was there any indication that the Sinsings had any\\nknowledge of the fate in store for them. The idling of rep-ray\\ngenerators was reported from the center of their camp, obviously those\\nof the ships the Hans had given them--the price of their treason to\\ntheir race.\\n\\nAgain I gave the word, and Hearn passed on the order to his\\nsubordinates.\\n\\nFar below us, and several miles to the right and left, the two barrage\\nlines made their appearance. From the great height to which we had\\nrisen, they appeared like lines of brilliant, winking lights, and the\\ndetonations were muffled by the distances into a sort of rumbling,\\ndistant thunder. Hearn and his assistants were very busy: measuring,\\ncalculating, and snapping out ultrophone orders to unit commanders that\\nresulted in the straightening of lines and the closing of gaps in the\\nbarrage.\\n\\nThe White Division Boss reported the utmost confusion in the Sinsing\\norganization. They were, as might be expected, an inefficient, loosely\\ndisciplined gang, and repeated broadcasts for help to neighboring gangs.\\nIgnoring the fact that the Mongolians had not used explosives for many\\ngenerations, they nevertheless jumped at the conclusion that they were\\nbeing raided by the Hans. Their frantic broadcasts persisted in this\\nthought, despite the nervous electrophonic inquiries of the Hans\\nthemselves, to whom the sound of the battle was evidently audible, and\\nwho were trying to locate the trouble.\\n\\nAt this point, the swooper I had sent south toward the city went into\\naction as a diversion, to keep the Hans at home. Its \"kite-tail\" loaded\\nwith long-range gunners, using the most highly explosive rockets we had,\\nhung invisible in the darkness of the sky and bombarded the city from a\\ndistance of about five miles. With an entire city to shoot at, and the\\nobject of creating as much commotion therein as possible, regardless of\\nactual damage, the gunners had no difficulty in hitting the mark. I\\ncould see the glow of the city and the stabbing flashes of exploding\\nrockets. In the end, the Hans, uncertain as to what was going on, fell\\nback on a defensive policy, and shot their \"hell cylinder,\" or wall of\\nupturned disintegrator rays into operation. That, of course, ended our\\nbombardment of them. The rays were a perfect defense, disintegrating our\\nrockets as they were reached.\\n\\nIf they had not sent out ships before turning on the rays, and if they\\nhad none within sufficient radius already in the air, all would be well.\\n\\nI queried Garlin on this, but he assured me Yellow Intelligence reported\\nno indications of Han ships nearer than 800 miles. This would probably\\ngive us a free hand for a while, since most of their instruments\\nrecorded only imperfectly or not at all, through the death wall.\\n\\nRequisitioning one of the viewplates of the headquarters ship, and the\\nservices of an expert operator, I instructed him to focus on our lines\\nbelow. I wanted a close-up of the men in action.\\n\\nHe began to manipulate his controls and chaotic shadows moved rapidly\\nacross the plate, fading in and out of focus, until he reached an\\nadjustment that gave me a picture of the forest floor, apparently 100\\nfeet wide, with the intervening branches and foliage of the trees\\nappearing like shadows that melted into reality a few feet above the\\nground.\\n\\nI watched one man setting up his long-gun with skillful speed. His lips\\npursed slightly as though he were whistling, as he adjusted the tall\\ntripod on which the long tube was balanced. Swiftly he twirled the knobs\\ncontrolling the aim and elevation of his piece. Then, lifting a belt of\\nammunition from the big box, which itself looked heavy enough to break\\ndown the spindly tripod, he inserted the end of it in the lock of his\\ntube and touched the proper combination of buttons.\\n\\nThen he stepped aside, and occupied himself with peering carefully\\nthrough the trees ahead. Not even a tremor shook the tube, but I knew\\nthat at intervals of something less than a second, it was discharging\\nsmall projectiles which, traveling under their own continuously reduced\\npower, were arching into the air, to fall precisely five miles ahead and\\nexplode with the force of eight-inch shells, such as we used in the\\nFirst World War.\\n\\nAnother gunner, fifty feet to the right of him, waved a hand and called\\nout something to him. Then, picking up his own tube and tripod, he\\ngauged the distance between the trees ahead of him, and the height of\\ntheir lowest branches, and bending forward a bit, flexed his muscles and\\nleaped lightly, some twenty-five feet. Another leap took him another\\ntwenty feet or so, where he began to set up his piece.\\n\\nI ordered my observer then to switch to the barrage itself. He got a\\nclose focus on it, but this showed little except a continuous series of\\nblinding flashes, which, from the viewplate, lit up the entire interior\\nof the ship. An eight-hundred-foot focus proved better. I had thought\\nthat some of our French and American artillery of the 20th Century had\\nachieved the ultimate in mathematical precision of fire, but I had never\\nseen anything to equal the accuracy of that line of terrific explosions\\nas it moved steadily forward, mowing down trees as a scythe cuts grass\\n(or used to 500 years ago), literally churning up the earth and the\\nsplintered, blasted remains of the forest giants, to a depth of from ten\\nto twenty feet.\\n\\nBy now the two curtains of fire were nearing each other, lines of\\nvibrant, shimmering, continuous, brilliant destruction, inevitably\\nsqueezing the panic-stricken Sinsings between them.\\n\\nEven as I watched, a group of them, who had been making a futile effort\\nto get their three rep-ray machines into the air, abandoned their\\nefforts, and rushed forth into the milling mob.\\n\\nI queried the Control Boss sharply on the futility of this attempt of\\ntheirs, and learned that the Hans, apparently in doubt as to what was\\ngoing on, had continued to \"play safe,\" and broken off their power\\nbroadcast, after ordering all their own ships east of the Alleghenies to\\nthe ground, for fear these ships they had traded to the Sinsings might\\nbe used against them.\\n\\nAgain I turned to my viewplate, which was still focussed on the central\\nsection of the Sinsing works. The confusion of the traitors was entirely\\nthat of fear, for our barrage had not yet reached them.\\n\\nSome of them set up their long-guns and fired at random over the barrage\\nline, then gave it up. They realized that they had no target to shoot\\nat, no way of knowing whether our gunners were a few hundred feet or\\nseveral miles beyond it.\\n\\nTheir ultrophone men, of whom they did not have many, stood around in\\ntense attitudes, their helmet phones strapped around their ears,\\nnervously fingering the tuning controls at their belts. Unquestionably\\nthey must have located some of our frequencies, and overheard many of\\nour reports and orders. But they were confused and disorganized. If they\\nhad an Ultrophone Boss they evidently were not reporting to him in an\\norganized way.\\n\\nThey were beginning to draw back now before our advancing fire. With\\nintermittent desperation, they began to shoot over our barrage again,\\nand the explosions of their rockets flashed at widely scattered points\\nbeyond. A few took distance \"pot shots.\"\\n\\nOddly enough it was our own forces that suffered the first casualties in\\nthe battle. Some of these distance shots by chance registered hits,\\nwhile our men were under strict orders not to exceed their barrage\\ndistances.\\n\\nSeen upon the ultroscope viewplate, the battle looked as though it were\\nbeing fought in daylight, perhaps on a cloudy day, while the explosions\\nof the rockets appeared as flashes of extra brilliance.\\n\\nThe two barrage lines were not more than five hundred feet apart when\\nthe Sinsings resorted to tactics we had not foreseen. We noticed first\\nthat they began to lighten themselves by throwing away extra equipment.\\nA few of them in their excitement threw away too much, and shot suddenly\\ninto the air. Then a scattering few floated up gently, followed by\\nincreasing numbers, while still others, preserving a weight balance,\\njumped toward the closing barrages and leaped high, hoping to clear\\nthem. Some succeeded. We saw others blown about like leaves in a\\nwindstorm, to crumple and drift slowly down, or else to fall into the\\nbarrage, their belts blown from their bodies.\\n\\nHowever, it was not part of our plan to allow a single one of them to\\nescape and find his way to the Hans. I quickly passed the word to Bill\\nHearn to have the alternate men in his line raise their barrages and\\nheard him bark out a mathematical formula to the Unit Bosses.\\n\\nWe backed off our ships as the explosions climbed into the air in\\nstagger formation until they reached a height of three miles. I don\\'t\\nbelieve any of the Sinsings who tried to float away to freedom\\nsucceeded.\\n\\nBut we did know later, that a few who leaped the barrage got away and\\nultimately reached Nu-yok.\\n\\nIt was those who managed to jump the barrage who gave us the most\\ntrouble. With half of our long-guns turned aloft, I foresaw we would not\\nhave enough to establish successive ground barrages and so ordered the\\nbarrage back two miles, from which positions our \"curtains\" began to\\nclose in again, this time, however, gauged to explode, not on contact,\\nbut thirty feet in the air. This left little chance for the Sinsings to\\nleap either over or under it.\\n\\nGradually, the two barrages approached each other until they finally\\nmet, and in the grey dawn the battle ended.\\n\\nOur own casualties amounted to forty-seven men in the ground forces,\\neighteen of whom had been slain in hand to hand fighting with the few of\\nthe enemy who managed to reach our lines, and sixty-two in the crew and\\n\"kite-tail\" force of swooper No. 4, which had been located by one of\\nthe enemy\\'s ultroscopes and brought down with long-gun fire.\\n\\nSince nearly every member of the Sinsing Gang had, so far as we knew,\\nbeen killed, we considered the raid a great success.\\n\\nIt had, however, a far greater significance than this. To all of us who\\ntook part in the expedition, the effectiveness of our barrage tactics\\ndefinitely established a confidence in our ability to overcome the Hans.\\n\\nAs I pointed out to Wilma:\\n\\n\"It has been my belief all along, dear, that the American explosive\\nrocket is a far more efficient weapon than the disintegrator ray of the\\nHans, once we can train all our gangs to use it systematically and in\\nco-ordinated fashion. As a weapon in the hands of a single individual,\\nshooting at a mark in direct line of vision, the rocket-gun is inferior\\nin destructive power to the dis ray, except as its range may be a little\\ngreater. The trouble is that to date it has been used only as we used\\nour rifles and shot guns in the 20th Century. The possibilities of its\\nuse as artillery, in laying barrages that advance along the ground, or\\nclimb into the air, are tremendous.\\n\\n\"The dis ray inevitably reveals its source of emanation. The rocket gun\\ndoes not. The dis ray can reach its target only in a straight line. The\\nrocket may be made to travel in an arc, over intervening obstacles, to\\nan unseen target.\\n\\n\"Nor must we forget that our ultronists now are promising us a perfect\\nshield against the dis ray in inertron.\"\\n\\n\"I tremble though, Tony dear, when I think of the horrors that are ahead\\nof us. The Hans are clever. They will develop defenses against our new\\ntactics. And they are sure to mass against us not only the full force of\\ntheir power in America, but the united forces of the World Empire. They\\nare a cowardly race in one sense, but clever as the very Devils in Hell,\\nand inheritors of a calm, ruthless, vicious persistency.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless,\" I prophesied, \"the Finger of Doom points squarely at\\nthem today, and unless you and I are killed in the struggle, we shall\\nlive to see America blast the Yellow Blight from the face of the Earth.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTranscriber\\'s Note:\\n\\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ August 1928.\\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n',\n",
