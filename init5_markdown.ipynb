Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:\\n\\n📝 **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.  \\n🖼️ **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.  \\n🗣️ **Audio**: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.  \\n🐙 **Multimodal**: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.\\n\\n🤗 Transformers support framework interoperability between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. This provides the flexibility to use a different framework at each stage of a model’s life; train a model in three lines of code in one framework, and load it for inference in another. Models can also be exported to a format like ONNX and TorchScript for deployment in production environments.\\n\\nJoin the growing community on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/), or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JfAtkvEtRb) today!\\n\\n## If you are looking for custom support from the Hugging Face team\\n\\n[![HuggingFace Expert Acceleration Program](https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/marketing/transformers/new-support-improved.png)](https://huggingface.co/support)\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\nThe documentation is organized into five sections:\\n\\n-   **GET STARTED** provides a quick tour of the library and installation instructions to get up and running.\\n    \\n-   **TUTORIALS** are a great place to start if you’re a beginner. This section will help you gain the basic skills you need to start using the library.\\n    \\n-   **HOW-TO GUIDES** show you how to achieve a specific goal, like finetuning a pretrained model for language modeling or how to write and share a custom model.\\n    \\n-   **CONCEPTUAL GUIDES** offers more discussion and explanation of the underlying concepts and ideas behind models, tasks, and the design philosophy of 🤗 Transformers.\\n    \\n-   **API** describes all classes and functions:\\n    \\n    -   **MAIN CLASSES** details the most important classes like configuration, model, tokenizer, and pipeline.\\n    -   **MODELS** details the classes and functions related to each model implemented in the library.\\n    -   **INTERNAL HELPERS** details utility classes and functions used internally.\\n\\n### Supported models\\n\\n1.  **[ALBERT](model_doc/albert)** (from Google Research and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) released with the paper [ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942), by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma, Radu Soricut.\\n2.  **[ALIGN](model_doc/align)** (from Google Research) released with the paper [Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918) by Chao Jia, Yinfei Yang, Ye Xia, Yi-Ting Chen, Zarana Parekh, Hieu Pham, Quoc V.

Whether you’re a developer or an everyday user, this quick tour will help you get started and show you how to use the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for inference, load a pretrained model and preprocessor with an [AutoClass](./model_doc/auto), and quickly train a model with PyTorch or TensorFlow. If you’re a beginner, we recommend checking out our tutorials or [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) next for more in-depth explanations of the concepts introduced here.\\n\\nBefore you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:\\n\\n```\\n!pip install transformers datasets\\n```\\n\\nYou’ll also need to install your preferred machine learning framework:\\n\\n## Pipeline\\n\\nThe [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) is the easiest and fastest way to use a pretrained model for inference. You can use the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) out-of-the-box for many tasks across different modalities, some of which are shown in the table below:\\n\\nFor a complete list of available tasks, check out the [pipeline API reference](./main_classes/pipelines).\\n\\n| **Task** | **Description** | **Modality** | **Pipeline identifier** |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Text classification | assign a label to a given sequence of text | NLP | pipeline(task=“sentiment-analysis”) |\\n| Text generation | generate text given a prompt | NLP | pipeline(task=“text-generation”) |\\n| Summarization | generate a summary of a sequence of text or document | NLP | pipeline(task=“summarization”) |\\n| Image classification | assign a label to an image | Computer vision | pipeline(task=“image-classification”) |\\n| Image segmentation | assign a label to each individual pixel of an image (supports semantic, panoptic, and instance segmentation) | Computer vision | pipeline(task=“image-segmentation”) |\\n| Object detection | predict the bounding boxes and classes of objects in an image | Computer vision | pipeline(task=“object-detection”) |\\n| Audio classification | assign a label to some audio data | Audio | pipeline(task=“audio-classification”) |\\n| Automatic speech recognition | transcribe speech into text | Audio | pipeline(task=“automatic-speech-recognition”) |\\n| Visual question answering | answer a question about the image, given an image and a question | Multimodal | pipeline(task=“vqa”) |\\n| Document question answering | answer a question about the document, given a document and a question | Multimodal | pipeline(task=“document-question-answering”) |\\n| Image captioning | generate a caption for a given image | Multimodal | pipeline(task=“image-to-text”) |\\n\\nStart by creating an instance of [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) and specifying a task you want to use it for. In this guide, you’ll use the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for sentiment analysis as an example:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n>>> classifier = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\")\\n```\\n\\nThe [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) downloads and caches a default [pretrained model](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) and tokenizer for sentiment analysis. Now you can use the `classifier` on your target text:\\n\\n```\\n>>> classifier(\"We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.\")\\n[{\\'label\\': \\'POSITIVE\\', \\'score\\': 0.9998}]\\n```\\n\\nIf you have more than one input, pass your inputs as a list to the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) to return a list of dictionaries:\\n\\n```\\n>>> results = classifier([\"We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.\", \"We hope you don\\'t hate it.\"])\\n>>> for result in results:\\n...     print(f\"label: {result[\\'label\\']}, with score: {round(result[\\'score\\'], 4)}\")\\nlabel: POSITIVE, with score: 0.9998\\nlabel: NEGATIVE, with score: 0.5309\\n```\\n\\nThe [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) can also iterate over an entire dataset for any task you like. For this example, let’s choose automatic speech recognition as our task:\\n\\n```\\n>>> import torch\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n>>> speech_recognizer = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", model=\"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\\n```\\n\\nLoad an audio dataset (see the 🤗 Datasets [Quick Start](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart#audio) for more details) you’d like to iterate over. For example, load the [MInDS-14](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/minds14) dataset:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from datasets import load_dataset, Audio\\n\\n>>> dataset = load_dataset(\"PolyAI/minds14\", name=\"en-US\", split=\"train\")\\n```\\n\\nYou need to make sure the sampling rate of the dataset matches the sampling rate [`facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h) was trained on:\\n\\n```\\n>>> dataset = dataset.cast_column(\"audio\", Audio(sampling_rate=speech_recognizer.feature_extractor.sampling_rate))\\n```\\n\\nThe audio files are automatically loaded and resampled when calling the `\"audio\"` column. Extract the raw waveform arrays from the first 4 samples and pass it as a list to the pipeline:\\n\\n```\\n>>> result = speech_recognizer(dataset[:4][\"audio\"])\\n>>> print([d[\"text\"] for d in result])\\n[\\'I WOULD LIKE TO SET UP A JOINT ACCOUNT WITH MY PARTNER HOW DO I PROCEED WITH DOING THAT\\', \"FONDERING HOW I\\'D SET UP A JOIN TO HELL T WITH MY WIFE AND WHERE THE AP MIGHT BE\", \"I I\\'D LIKE TOY SET UP A JOINT ACCOUNT WITH MY PARTNER I\\'M NOT SEEING THE OPTION TO DO IT ON THE APSO I CALLED IN TO GET SOME HELP CAN I JUST DO IT OVER THE PHONE WITH YOU AND GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION OR SHOULD I DO IT IN THE AP AN I\\'M MISSING SOMETHING UQUETTE HAD PREFERRED TO JUST DO IT OVER THE PHONE OF POSSIBLE THINGS\", \\'HOW DO I FURN A JOINA COUT\\']\\n```\\n\\nFor larger datasets where the inputs are big (like in speech or vision), you’ll want to pass a generator instead of a list to load all the inputs in memory. Take a look at the [pipeline API reference](./main_classes/pipelines) for more information.\\n\\n### Use another model and tokenizer in the pipeline\\n\\nThe [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) can accommodate any model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), making it easy to adapt the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for other use-cases. For example, if you’d like a model capable of handling French text, use the tags on the Hub to filter for an appropriate model. The top filtered result returns a multilingual [BERT model](https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment) finetuned for sentiment analysis you can use for French text:\\n\\n```\\n>>> model_name = \"nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\"\\n```\\n\\nUse [AutoModelForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) and [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) to load the pretrained model and it’s associated tokenizer (more on an `AutoClass` in the next section):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n```\\n\\nUse [TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification) and [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) to load the pretrained model and it’s associated tokenizer (more on an `TFAutoClass` in the next section):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n>>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n```\\n\\nSpecify the model and tokenizer in the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline), and now you can apply the `classifier` on French text:\\n\\n```\\n>>> classifier = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\\n>>> classifier(\"Nous sommes très heureux de vous présenter la bibliothèque 🤗 Transformers.\")\\n[{\\'label\\': \\'5 stars\\', \\'score\\': 0.7273}]\\n```\\n\\nIf you can’t find a model for your use-case, you’ll need to finetune a pretrained model on your data. Take a look at our [finetuning tutorial](./training) to learn how. Finally, after you’ve finetuned your pretrained model, please consider [sharing](./model_sharing) the model with the community on the Hub to democratize machine learning for everyone! 🤗\\n\\n## AutoClass\\n\\nUnder the hood, the [AutoModelForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) and [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer) classes work together to power the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) you used above. An [AutoClass](./model_doc/auto) is a shortcut that automatically retrieves the architecture of a pretrained model from its name or path. You only need to select the appropriate `AutoClass` for your task and it’s associated preprocessing class.\\n\\nLet’s return to the example from the previous section and see how you can use the `AutoClass` to replicate the results of the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline).\\n\\n### AutoTokenizer\\n\\nA tokenizer is responsible for preprocessing text into an array of numbers as inputs to a model. There are multiple rules that govern the tokenization process, including how to split a word and at what level words should be split (learn more about tokenization in the [tokenizer summary](./tokenizer_summary)). The most important thing to remember is you need to instantiate a tokenizer with the same model name to ensure you’re using the same tokenization rules a model was pretrained with.\\n\\nLoad a tokenizer with [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer\\n\\n>>> model_name = \"nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\"\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n```\\n\\nPass your text to the tokenizer:\\n\\n```\\n>>> encoding = tokenizer(\"We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.\")\\n>>> print(encoding)\\n{\\'input_ids\\': [101, 11312, 10320, 12495, 19308, 10114, 11391, 10855, 10103, 100, 58263, 13299, 119, 102],\\n \\'token_type_ids\\': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n \\'attention_mask\\': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\\n```\\n\\nThe tokenizer returns a dictionary containing:\\n\\n-   [input\\\\_ids](./glossary#input-ids): numerical representations of your tokens.\\n-   [attention\\\\_mask](.glossary#attention-mask): indicates which tokens should be attended to.\\n\\nA tokenizer can also accept a list of inputs, and pad and truncate the text to return a batch with uniform length:\\n\\n```\\n>>> pt_batch = tokenizer(\\n...     [\"We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.\", \"We hope you don\\'t hate it.\"],\\n...     padding=True,\\n...     truncation=True,\\n...     max_length=512,\\n...     return_tensors=\"pt\",\\n... )\\n```\\n\\n```\\n>>> tf_batch = tokenizer(\\n...     [\"We are very happy to show you the 🤗 Transformers library.\", \"We hope you don\\'t hate it.\"],\\n...     padding=True,\\n...     truncation=True,\\n...     max_length=512,\\n...     return_tensors=\"tf\",\\n... )\\n```\\n\\nCheck out the [preprocess](./preprocessing) tutorial for more details about tokenization, and how to use an [AutoImageProcessor](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoImageProcessor), [AutoFeatureExtractor](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoFeatureExtractor) and [AutoProcessor](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoProcessor) to preprocess image, audio, and multimodal inputs.\\n\\n### AutoModel\\n\\n🤗 Transformers provides a simple and unified way to load pretrained instances. This means you can load an [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) like you would load an [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). The only difference is selecting the correct [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) for the task. For text (or sequence) classification, you should load [AutoModelForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n>>> model_name = \"nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\"\\n>>> pt_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n```\\n\\nSee the [task summary](./task_summary) for tasks supported by an [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) class.\\n\\nNow pass your preprocessed batch of inputs directly to the model. You just have to unpack the dictionary by adding `**`:\\n\\n```\\n>>> pt_outputs = pt_model(**pt_batch)\\n```\\n\\nThe model outputs the final activations in the `logits` attribute. Apply the softmax function to the `logits` to retrieve the probabilities:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from torch import nn\\n\\n>>> pt_predictions = nn.functional.softmax(pt_outputs.logits, dim=-1)\\n>>> print(pt_predictions)\\ntensor([[0.0021, 0.0018, 0.0115, 0.2121, 0.7725],\\n        [0.2084, 0.1826, 0.1969, 0.1755, 0.2365]], grad_fn=<SoftmaxBackward0>)\\n```\\n\\n🤗 Transformers provides a simple and unified way to load pretrained instances. This means you can load an [TFAutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.TFAutoModel) like you would load an [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). The only difference is selecting the correct [TFAutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.TFAutoModel) for the task. For text (or sequence) classification, you should load [TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n>>> model_name = \"nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\"\\n>>> tf_model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\\n```\\n\\nSee the [task summary](./task_summary) for tasks supported by an [AutoModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModel) class.\\n\\nNow pass your preprocessed batch of inputs directly to the model. You can pass the tensors as-is:\\n\\n```\\n>>> tf_outputs = tf_model(tf_batch)\\n```\\n\\nThe model outputs the final activations in the `logits` attribute. Apply the softmax function to the `logits` to retrieve the probabilities:\\n\\n```\\n>>> import tensorflow as tf\\n\\n>>> tf_predictions = tf.nn.softmax(tf_outputs.logits, axis=-1)\\n>>> tf_predictions\\n```\\n\\nAll 🤗 Transformers models (PyTorch or TensorFlow) output the tensors _before_ the final activation function (like softmax) because the final activation function is often fused with the loss. Model outputs are special dataclasses so their attributes are autocompleted in an IDE. The model outputs behave like a tuple or a dictionary (you can index with an integer, a slice or a string) in which case, attributes that are None are ignored.\\n\\n### Save a model\\n\\nOnce your model is fine-tuned, you can save it with its tokenizer using [PreTrainedModel.save\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> pt_save_directory = \"./pt_save_pretrained\"\\n>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained(pt_save_directory)\\n>>> pt_model.save_pretrained(pt_save_directory)\\n```\\n\\nWhen you are ready to use the model again, reload it with [PreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> pt_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"./pt_save_pretrained\")\\n```\\n\\nOnce your model is fine-tuned, you can save it with its tokenizer using [TFPreTrainedModel.save\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.save_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> tf_save_directory = \"./tf_save_pretrained\"\\n>>> tokenizer.save_pretrained(tf_save_directory)\\n>>> tf_model.save_pretrained(tf_save_directory)\\n```\\n\\nWhen you are ready to use the model again, reload it with [TFPreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> tf_model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"./tf_save_pretrained\")\\n```\\n\\nOne particularly cool 🤗 Transformers feature is the ability to save a model and reload it as either a PyTorch or TensorFlow model. The `from_pt` or `from_tf` parameter can convert the model from one framework to the other:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModel\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tf_save_directory)\\n>>> pt_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(tf_save_directory, from_tf=True)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import TFAutoModel\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pt_save_directory)\\n>>> tf_model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(pt_save_directory, from_pt=True)\\n```\\n\\n## Custom model builds\\n\\nYou can modify the model’s configuration class to change how a model is built. The configuration specifies a model’s attributes, such as the number of hidden layers or attention heads. You start from scratch when you initialize a model from a custom configuration class. The model attributes are randomly initialized, and you’ll need to train the model before you can use it to get meaningful results.\\n\\nStart by importing [AutoConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoConfig), and then load the pretrained model you want to modify. Within [AutoConfig.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoConfig.from_pretrained), you can specify the attribute you want to change, such as the number of attention heads:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoConfig\\n\\n>>> my_config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\", n_heads=12)\\n```\\n\\nCreate a model from your custom configuration with [AutoModel.from\\\\_config()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.FlaxAutoModelForVision2Seq.from_config):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModel\\n\\n>>> my_model = AutoModel.from_config(my_config)\\n```\\n\\nCreate a model from your custom configuration with [TFAutoModel.from\\\\_config()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.FlaxAutoModelForVision2Seq.from_config):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import TFAutoModel\\n\\n>>> my_model = TFAutoModel.from_config(my_config)\\n```\\n\\nTake a look at the [Create a custom architecture](./create_a_model) guide for more information about building custom configurations.\\n\\n## Trainer - a PyTorch optimized training loop\\n\\nAll models are a standard [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) so you can use them in any typical training loop. While you can write your own training loop, 🤗 Transformers provides a [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) class for PyTorch, which contains the basic training loop and adds additional functionality for features like distributed training, mixed precision, and more.\\n\\nDepending on your task, you’ll typically pass the following parameters to [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer):\\n\\n1.  You’ll start with a [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel) or a [`torch.nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module):\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n    \\n    >>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n    ```\\n    \\n2.  [TrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) contains the model hyperparameters you can change like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to train for. The default values are used if you don’t specify any training arguments:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from transformers import TrainingArguments\\n    \\n    >>> training_args = TrainingArguments(\\n    ...     output_dir=\"path/to/save/folder/\",\\n    ...     learning_rate=2e-5,\\n    ...     per_device_train_batch_size=8,\\n    ...     per_device_eval_batch_size=8,\\n    ...     num_train_epochs=2,\\n    ... )\\n    ```\\n    \\n3.  Load a preprocessing class like a tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor, or processor:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer\\n    \\n    >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n    ```\\n    \\n4.  Load a dataset:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset\\n    \\n    >>> dataset = load_dataset(\"rotten_tomatoes\")  \\n    ```\\n    \\n5.  Create a function to tokenize the dataset:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> def tokenize_dataset(dataset):\\n    ...     return tokenizer(dataset[\"text\"])\\n    ```\\n    \\n    Then apply it over the entire dataset with [map](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.14.5/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.map):\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_dataset, batched=True)\\n    ```\\n    \\n6.  A [DataCollatorWithPadding](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/data_collator#transformers.DataCollatorWithPadding) to create a batch of examples from your dataset:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding\\n    \\n    >>> data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer)\\n    ```\\n    \\n\\nNow gather all these classes in [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import Trainer\\n\\n>>> trainer = Trainer(\\n...     model=model,\\n...     args=training_args,\\n...     train_dataset=dataset[\"train\"],\\n...     eval_dataset=dataset[\"test\"],\\n...     tokenizer=tokenizer,\\n...     data_collator=data_collator,\\n... )  \\n```\\n\\nWhen you’re ready, call [train()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer.train) to start training:\\n\\nFor tasks - like translation or summarization - that use a sequence-to-sequence model, use the [Seq2SeqTrainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainer) and [Seq2SeqTrainingArguments](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments) classes instead.\\n\\nYou can customize the training loop behavior by subclassing the methods inside [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer). This allows you to customize features such as the loss function, optimizer, and scheduler. Take a look at the [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) reference for which methods can be subclassed.\\n\\nThe other way to customize the training loop is by using [Callbacks](./main_classes/callbacks). You can use callbacks to integrate with other libraries and inspect the training loop to report on progress or stop the training early. Callbacks do not modify anything in the training loop itself. To customize something like the loss function, you need to subclass the [Trainer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer) instead.\\n\\n## Train with TensorFlow\\n\\nAll models are a standard [`tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) so they can be trained in TensorFlow with the [Keras](https://keras.io/) API. 🤗 Transformers provides the [prepare\\\\_tf\\\\_dataset()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset) method to easily load your dataset as a `tf.data.Dataset` so you can start training right away with Keras’ [`compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#compile-method) and [`fit`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis/#fit-method) methods.\\n\\n1.  You’ll start with a [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel) or a [`tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model):\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n    \\n    >>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n    ```\\n    \\n2.  Load a preprocessing class like a tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor, or processor:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer\\n    \\n    >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n    ```\\n    \\n3.  Create a function to tokenize the dataset:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> def tokenize_dataset(dataset):\\n    ...     return tokenizer(dataset[\"text\"])  \\n    ```\\n    \\n4.  Apply the tokenizer over the entire dataset with [map](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.14.5/en/package_reference/main_classes#datasets.Dataset.map) and then pass the dataset and tokenizer to [prepare\\\\_tf\\\\_dataset()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel.prepare_tf_dataset). You can also change the batch size and shuffle the dataset here if you’d like:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_dataset)  \\n    >>> tf_dataset = model.prepare_tf_dataset(\\n    ...     dataset[\"train\"], batch_size=16, shuffle=True, tokenizer=tokenizer\\n    ... )  \\n    ```\\n    \\n5.  When you’re ready, you can call `compile` and `fit` to start training. Note that Transformers models all have a default task-relevant loss function, so you don’t need to specify one unless you want to:\\n    \\n    ```\\n    >>> from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\\n    \\n    >>> model.compile(optimizer=Adam(3e-5))  \\n    >>> model.fit(tf_dataset)  \\n    ```\\n    \\n\\n## What\\'s next?\\n\\nNow that you’ve completed the 🤗 Transformers quick tour, check out our guides and learn how to do more specific things like writing a custom model, fine-tuning a model for a task, and how to train a model with a script.

       "  'content': '# Installation\\n\\nInstall 🤗 Transformers for whichever deep learning library you’re working with, setup your cache, and optionally configure 🤗 Transformers to run offline.\\n\\n🤗 Transformers is tested on Python 3.6+, PyTorch 1.1.0+, TensorFlow 2.0+, and Flax. Follow the installation instructions below for the deep learning library you are using:\\n\\n-   [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installation instructions.\\n-   [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) installation instructions.\\n-   [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installation instructions.\\n\\n## Install with pip\\n\\nYou should install 🤗 Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you’re unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, take a look at this [guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). A virtual environment makes it easier to manage different projects, and avoid compatibility issues between dependencies.\\n\\nStart by creating a virtual environment in your project directory:\\n\\nActivate the virtual environment. On Linux and MacOs:\\n\\nActivate Virtual environment on Windows\\n\\nNow you’re ready to install 🤗 Transformers with the following command:\\n\\nFor CPU-support only, you can conveniently install 🤗 Transformers and a deep learning library in one line. For example, install 🤗 Transformers and PyTorch with:\\n\\n```\\npip install \\'transformers[torch]\\'\\n```\\n\\n🤗 Transformers and TensorFlow 2.0:\\n\\n```\\npip install \\'transformers[tf-cpu]\\'\\n```\\n\\nM1 / ARM Users\\n\\nYou will need to install the following before installing TensorFLow 2.0\\n\\n```\\nbrew install cmake\\nbrew install pkg-config\\n```\\n\\n🤗 Transformers and Flax:\\n\\n```\\npip install \\'transformers[flax]\\'\\n```\\n\\nFinally, check if 🤗 Transformers has been properly installed by running the following command. It will download a pretrained model:\\n\\n```\\npython -c \"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline(\\'sentiment-analysis\\')(\\'we love you\\'))\"\\n```\\n\\nThen print out the label and score:\\n\\n```\\n[{\\'label\\': \\'POSITIVE\\', \\'score\\': 0.9998704791069031}]\\n```\\n\\n## Install from source\\n\\nInstall 🤗 Transformers from source with the following command:\\n\\n```\\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n```\\n\\nThis command installs the bleeding edge `main` version rather than the latest `stable` version. The `main` version is useful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments. For instance, if a bug has been fixed since the last official release but a new release hasn’t been rolled out yet. However, this means the `main` version may not always be stable. We strive to keep the `main` version operational, and most issues are usually resolved within a few hours or a day. If you run into a problem, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) so we can fix it even sooner!\\n\\nCheck if 🤗 Transformers has been properly installed by running the following command:\\n\\n```\\npython -c \"from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline(\\'sentiment-analysis\\')(\\'I love you\\'))\"\\n```\\n\\n## Editable install\\n\\nYou will need an editable install if you’d like to:\\n\\n-   Use the `main` version of the source code.\\n-   Contribute to 🤗 Transformers and need to test changes in the code.\\n\\nClone the repository and install 🤗 Transformers with the following commands:\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\\ncd transformers\\npip install -e .\\n```\\n\\nThese commands will link the folder you cloned the repository to and your Python library paths. Python will now look inside the folder you cloned to in addition to the normal library paths. For example, if your Python packages are typically installed in `~/anaconda3/envs/main/lib/python3.7/site-packages/`, Python will also search the folder you cloned to: `~/transformers/`.\\n\\nYou must keep the `transformers` folder if you want to keep using the library.\\n\\nNow you can easily update your clone to the latest version of 🤗 Transformers with the following command:\\n\\n```\\ncd ~/transformers/\\ngit pull\\n```\\n\\nYour Python environment will find the `main` version of 🤗 Transformers on the next run.\\n\\n## Install with conda\\n\\nInstall from the conda channel `huggingface`:\\n\\n```\\nconda install -c huggingface transformers\\n```\\n\\n## Cache setup\\n\\nPretrained models are downloaded and locally cached at: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`. This is the default directory given by the shell environment variable `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`. On Windows, the default directory is given by `C:\\\\Users\\\\username\\\\.cache\\\\huggingface\\\\hub`. You can change the shell environment variables shown below - in order of priority - to specify a different cache directory:\\n\\n1.  Shell environment variable (default): `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` or `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`.\\n2.  Shell environment variable: `HF_HOME`.\\n3.  Shell environment variable: `XDG_CACHE_HOME` + `/huggingface`.\\n\\n🤗 Transformers will use the shell environment variables `PYTORCH_TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` or `PYTORCH_PRETRAINED_BERT_CACHE` if you are coming from an earlier iteration of this library and have set those environment variables, unless you specify the shell environment variable `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE`.\\n\\n## Offline mode\\n\\nRun 🤗 Transformers in a firewalled or offline environment with locally cached files by setting the environment variable `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1`.\\n\\nAdd [🤗 Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/) to your offline training workflow with the environment variable `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1`.\\n\\n```\\nHF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1 TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 \\\\\\npython examples/pytorch/translation/run_translation.py --model_name_or_path t5-small --dataset_name wmt16 --dataset_config ro-en ...\\n```\\n\\nThis script should run without hanging or waiting to timeout because it won’t attempt to download the model from the Hub.\\n\\nYou can also bypass loading a model from the Hub from each [from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) call with the `local_files_only` parameter. When set to `True`, only local files are loaded:\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers import T5Model\\n\\nmodel = T5Model.from_pretrained(\"./path/to/local/directory\", local_files_only=True)\\n```\\n\\n### Fetch models and tokenizers to use offline\\n\\nAnother option for using 🤗 Transformers offline is to download the files ahead of time, and then point to their local path when you need to use them offline. There are three ways to do this:\\n\\n-   Download a file through the user interface on the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) by clicking on the ↓ icon.\\n    \\n    ![download-icon](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/download-icon.png)\\n    \\n-   Use the [PreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) and [PreTrainedModel.save\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained) workflow:\\n    \\n    1.  Download your files ahead of time with [PreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained):\\n        \\n        ```\\n        >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\\n        \\n        >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0_3B\")\\n        >>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"bigscience/T0_3B\")\\n        ```\\n        \\n    2.  Save your files to a specified directory with [PreTrainedModel.save\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained):\\n        \\n        ```\\n        >>> tokenizer.save_pretrained(\"./your/path/bigscience_t0\")\\n        >>> model.save_pretrained(\"./your/path/bigscience_t0\")\\n        ```\\n        \\n    3.  Now when you’re offline, reload your files with [PreTrainedModel.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) from the specified directory:\\n        \\n        ```\\n        >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"./your/path/bigscience_t0\")\\n        >>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"./your/path/bigscience_t0\")\\n        ```\\n        \\n-   Programmatically download files with the [huggingface\\\\_hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/tree/main/src/huggingface_hub) library:\\n    \\n    1.  Install the `huggingface_hub` library in your virtual environment:\\n        \\n        ```\\n        python -m pip install huggingface_hub\\n        ```\\n        \\n    2.  Use the [`hf_hub_download`](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/adding-a-library#download-files-from-the-hub) function to download a file to a specific path. For example, the following command downloads the `config.json` file from the [T0](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/T0_3B) model to your desired path:\\n        \\n        ```\\n        >>> from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\\n        \\n        >>> hf_hub_download(repo_id=\"bigscience/T0_3B\", filename=\"config.json\", cache_dir=\"./your/path/bigscience_t0\")\\n        ```\\n        \\n\\nOnce your file is downloaded and locally cached, specify it’s local path to load and use it:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoConfig\\n\\n>>> config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(\"./your/path/bigscience_t0/config.json\")\\n```\\n\\nSee the [How to download files from the Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/how-to-downstream) section for more details on downloading files stored on the Hub.',\n",

       "  'content': '# Pipelines for inference\\n\\nThe [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) makes it simple to use any model from the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. Even if you don’t have experience with a specific modality or aren’t familiar with the underlying code behind the models, you can still use them for inference with the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline)! This tutorial will teach you to:\\n\\n-   Use a [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for inference.\\n-   Use a specific tokenizer or model.\\n-   Use a [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for audio, vision, and multimodal tasks.\\n\\nTake a look at the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) documentation for a complete list of supported tasks and available parameters.\\n\\n## Pipeline usage\\n\\nWhile each task has an associated [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline), it is simpler to use the general [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) abstraction which contains all the task-specific pipelines. The [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) automatically loads a default model and a preprocessing class capable of inference for your task. Let’s take the example of using the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), or speech-to-text.\\n\\n1.  Start by creating a [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) and specify the inference task:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n>>> transcriber = pipeline(task=\"automatic-speech-recognition\")\\n```\\n\\n2.  Pass your input to the [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline). In the case of speech recognition, this is an audio input file:\\n\\n```\\n>>> transcriber(\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac\")\\n{\\'text\\': \\'I HAVE A DREAM BUT ONE DAY THIS NATION WILL RISE UP LIVE UP THE TRUE MEANING OF ITS TREES\\'}\\n```\\n\\nNot the result you had in mind? Check out some of the [most downloaded automatic speech recognition models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition&sort=trending) on the Hub to see if you can get a better transcription.\\n\\nLet’s try the [Whisper large-v2](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large) model from OpenAI. Whisper was released 2 years later than Wav2Vec2, and was trained on close to 10x more data. As such, it beats Wav2Vec2 on most downstream benchmarks. It also has the added benefit of predicting punctuation and casing, neither of which are possible with  \\nWav2Vec2.\\n\\nLet’s give it a try here to see how it performs:\\n\\n```\\n>>> transcriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\")\\n>>> transcriber(\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac\")\\n{\\'text\\': \\' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.\\'}\\n```\\n\\nNow this result looks more accurate! For a deep-dive comparison on Wav2Vec2 vs Whisper, refer to the [Audio Transformers Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter5/asr_models). We really encourage you to check out the Hub for models in different languages, models specialized in your field, and more. You can check out and compare model results directly from your browser on the Hub to see if it fits or handles corner cases better than other ones. And if you don’t find a model for your use case, you can always start [training](training) your own!\\n\\nIf you have several inputs, you can pass your input as a list:\\n\\n```\\ntranscriber(\\n    [\\n        \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac\",\\n        \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/1.flac\",\\n    ]\\n)\\n```\\n\\nPipelines are great for experimentation as switching from one model to another is trivial; however, there are some ways to optimize them for larger workloads than experimentation. See the following guides that dive into iterating over whole datasets or using pipelines in a webserver: of the docs:\\n\\n-   [Using pipelines on a dataset](#using-pipelines-on-a-dataset)\\n-   [Using pipelines for a webserver](./pipeline_webserver)\\n\\n## Parameters\\n\\n[pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) supports many parameters; some are task specific, and some are general to all pipelines. In general, you can specify parameters anywhere you want:\\n\\n```\\ntranscriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\", my_parameter=1)\\n\\nout = transcriber(...)  \\nout = transcriber(..., my_parameter=2)  \\nout = transcriber(...)  \\n```\\n\\nLet’s check out 3 important ones:\\n\\n### Device\\n\\nIf you use `device=n`, the pipeline automatically puts the model on the specified device. This will work regardless of whether you are using PyTorch or Tensorflow.\\n\\n```\\ntranscriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\", device=0)\\n```\\n\\nIf the model is too large for a single GPU and you are using PyTorch, you can set `device_map=\"auto\"` to automatically determine how to load and store the model weights. Using the `device_map` argument requires the 🤗 [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate) package:\\n\\n```\\npip install --upgrade accelerate\\n```\\n\\nThe following code automatically loads and stores model weights across devices:\\n\\n```\\ntranscriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\", device_map=\"auto\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that if `device_map=\"auto\"` is passed, there is no need to add the argument `device=device` when instantiating your `pipeline` as you may encounter some unexpected behavior!\\n\\n### Batch size\\n\\nBy default, pipelines will not batch inference for reasons explained in detail [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#pipeline-batching). The reason is that batching is not necessarily faster, and can actually be quite slower in some cases.\\n\\nBut if it works in your use case, you can use:\\n\\n```\\ntranscriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\", device=0, batch_size=2)\\naudio_filenames = [f\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/{i}.flac\" for i in range(1, 5)]\\ntexts = transcriber(audio_filenames)\\n```\\n\\nThis runs the pipeline on the 4 provided audio files, but it will pass them in batches of 2 to the model (which is on a GPU, where batching is more likely to help) without requiring any further code from you. The output should always match what you would have received without batching. It is only meant as a way to help you get more speed out of a pipeline.\\n\\nPipelines can also alleviate some of the complexities of batching because, for some pipelines, a single item (like a long audio file) needs to be chunked into multiple parts to be processed by a model. The pipeline performs this [_chunk batching_](./main_classes/pipelines#pipeline-chunk-batching) for you.\\n\\n### Task specific parameters\\n\\nAll tasks provide task specific parameters which allow for additional flexibility and options to help you get your job done. For instance, the [transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline.__call__) method has a `return_timestamps` parameter which sounds promising for subtitling videos:\\n\\n```\\n>>> transcriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\", return_timestamps=True)\\n>>> transcriber(\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/Narsil/asr_dummy/resolve/main/mlk.flac\")\\n{\\'text\\': \\' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.\\', \\'chunks\\': [{\\'timestamp\\': (0.0, 11.88), \\'text\\': \\' I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its\\'}, {\\'timestamp\\': (11.88, 12.38), \\'text\\': \\' creed.\\'}]}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the model inferred the text and also outputted **when** the various sentences were pronounced.\\n\\nThere are many parameters available for each task, so check out each task’s API reference to see what you can tinker with! For instance, the [AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.AutomaticSpeechRecognitionPipeline) has a `chunk_length_s` parameter which is helpful for working on really long audio files (for example, subtitling entire movies or hour-long videos) that a model typically cannot handle on its own:\\n\\n```\\n>>> transcriber = pipeline(model=\"openai/whisper-large-v2\", chunk_length_s=30, return_timestamps=True)\\n>>> transcriber(\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/sanchit-gandhi/librispeech_long/resolve/main/audio.wav\")\\n{\\'text\\': \" Chapter 16. I might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines, but I wanted you to see every step by which we came.  I, too, agree to whatever Marguerite wished, Marguerite to be unable to live apart from me. It was the day after the evening...\\n```\\n\\nIf you can’t find a parameter that would really help you out, feel free to [request it](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature-request.yml)!\\n\\n## Using pipelines on a dataset\\n\\nThe pipeline can also run inference on a large dataset. The easiest way we recommend doing this is by using an iterator:\\n\\n```\\ndef data():\\n    for i in range(1000):\\n        yield f\"My example {i}\"\\n\\n\\npipe = pipeline(model=\"gpt2\", device=0)\\ngenerated_characters = 0\\nfor out in pipe(data()):\\n    generated_characters += len(out[0][\"generated_text\"])\\n```\\n\\nThe iterator `data()` yields each result, and the pipeline automatically recognizes the input is iterable and will start fetching the data while it continues to process it on the GPU (this uses [DataLoader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) under the hood). This is important because you don’t have to allocate memory for the whole dataset and you can feed the GPU as fast as possible.\\n\\nSince batching could speed things up, it may be useful to try tuning the `batch_size` parameter here.\\n\\nThe simplest way to iterate over a dataset is to just load one from 🤗 [Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/):\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers.pipelines.pt_utils import KeyDataset\\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\\n\\npipe = pipeline(model=\"hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2\", device=0)\\ndataset = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation[:10]\")\\n\\nfor out in pipe(KeyDataset(dataset, \"audio\")):\\n    print(out)\\n```\\n\\n## Using pipelines for a webserver\\n\\nCreating an inference engine is a complex topic which deserves it\\'s own page.\\n\\n[Link](./pipeline_webserver)\\n\\n## Vision pipeline\\n\\nUsing a [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for vision tasks is practically identical.\\n\\nSpecify your task and pass your image to the classifier. The image can be a link, a local path or a base64-encoded image. For example, what species of cat is shown below?\\n\\n![pipeline-cat-chonk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg)\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n>>> vision_classifier = pipeline(model=\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\n>>> preds = vision_classifier(\\n...     images=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg\"\\n... )\\n>>> preds = [{\"score\": round(pred[\"score\"], 4), \"label\": pred[\"label\"]} for pred in preds]\\n>>> preds\\n[{\\'score\\': 0.4335, \\'label\\': \\'lynx, catamount\\'}, {\\'score\\': 0.0348, \\'label\\': \\'cougar, puma, catamount, mountain lion, painter, panther, Felis concolor\\'}, {\\'score\\': 0.0324, \\'label\\': \\'snow leopard, ounce, Panthera uncia\\'}, {\\'score\\': 0.0239, \\'label\\': \\'Egyptian cat\\'}, {\\'score\\': 0.0229, \\'label\\': \\'tiger cat\\'}]\\n```\\n\\n## Text pipeline\\n\\nUsing a [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) for NLP tasks is practically identical.\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n>>> \\n>>> \\n>>> classifier = pipeline(model=\"facebook/bart-large-mnli\")\\n>>> classifier(\\n...     \"I have a problem with my iphone that needs to be resolved asap!!\",\\n...     candidate_labels=[\"urgent\", \"not urgent\", \"phone\", \"tablet\", \"computer\"],\\n... )\\n{\\'sequence\\': \\'I have a problem with my iphone that needs to be resolved asap!!\\', \\'labels\\': [\\'urgent\\', \\'phone\\', \\'computer\\', \\'not urgent\\', \\'tablet\\'], \\'scores\\': [0.504, 0.479, 0.013, 0.003, 0.002]}\\n```\\n\\n## Multimodal pipeline\\n\\nThe [pipeline()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) supports more than one modality. For example, a visual question answering (VQA) task combines text and image. Feel free to use any image link you like and a question you want to ask about the image. The image can be a URL or a local path to the image.\\n\\nFor example, if you use this [invoice image](https://huggingface.co/spaces/impira/docquery/resolve/2359223c1837a7587402bda0f2643382a6eefeab/invoice.png):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n>>> vqa = pipeline(model=\"impira/layoutlm-document-qa\")\\n>>> vqa(\\n...     image=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/impira/docquery/resolve/2359223c1837a7587402bda0f2643382a6eefeab/invoice.png\",\\n...     question=\"What is the invoice number?\",\\n... )\\n[{\\'score\\': 0.42515, \\'answer\\': \\'us-001\\', \\'start\\': 16, \\'end\\': 16}]\\n```\\n\\nTo run the example above you need to have [`pytesseract`](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) installed in addition to 🤗 Transformers:\\n\\n```\\nsudo apt install -y tesseract-ocr\\npip install pytesseract\\n```\\n\\n## Using `pipeline` on large models with 🤗 `accelerate`:\\n\\nYou can easily run `pipeline` on large models using 🤗 `accelerate`! First make sure you have installed `accelerate` with `pip install accelerate`.\\n\\nFirst load your model using `device_map=\"auto\"`! We will use `facebook/opt-1.3b` for our example.\\n\\n```\\nimport torch\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\n\\npipe = pipeline(model=\"facebook/opt-1.3b\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")\\noutput = pipe(\"This is a cool example!\", do_sample=True, top_p=0.95)\\n```\\n\\nYou can also pass 8-bit loaded models if you install `bitsandbytes` and add the argument `load_in_8bit=True`\\n\\n```\\nimport torch\\nfrom transformers import pipeline\\n\\npipe = pipeline(model=\"facebook/opt-1.3b\", device_map=\"auto\", model_kwargs={\"load_in_8bit\": True})\\noutput = pipe(\"This is a cool example!\", do_sample=True, top_p=0.95)\\n```\\n\\nNote that you can replace the checkpoint with any of the Hugging Face model that supports large model loading such as BLOOM!',\n",

       "  'content': '# Load pretrained instances with an AutoClass\\n\\nWith so many different Transformer architectures, it can be challenging to create one for your checkpoint. As a part of 🤗 Transformers core philosophy to make the library easy, simple and flexible to use, an `AutoClass` automatically infers and loads the correct architecture from a given checkpoint. The `from_pretrained()` method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don’t have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch. Producing this type of checkpoint-agnostic code means if your code works for one checkpoint, it will work with another checkpoint - as long as it was trained for a similar task - even if the architecture is different.\\n\\nRemember, architecture refers to the skeleton of the model and checkpoints are the weights for a given architecture. For example, [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) is an architecture, while `bert-base-uncased` is a checkpoint. Model is a general term that can mean either architecture or checkpoint.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, learn to:\\n\\n-   Load a pretrained tokenizer.\\n-   Load a pretrained image processor\\n-   Load a pretrained feature extractor.\\n-   Load a pretrained processor.\\n-   Load a pretrained model.\\n\\n## AutoTokenizer\\n\\nNearly every NLP task begins with a tokenizer. A tokenizer converts your input into a format that can be processed by the model.\\n\\nLoad a tokenizer with [AutoTokenizer.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\\n```\\n\\nThen tokenize your input as shown below:\\n\\n```\\n>>> sequence = \"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\"\\n>>> print(tokenizer(sequence))\\n{\\'input_ids\\': [101, 1999, 1037, 4920, 1999, 1996, 2598, 2045, 2973, 1037, 7570, 10322, 4183, 1012, 102], \\n \\'token_type_ids\\': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \\n \\'attention_mask\\': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\\n```\\n\\n## AutoImageProcessor\\n\\nFor vision tasks, an image processor processes the image into the correct input format.\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoImageProcessor\\n\\n>>> image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/vit-base-patch16-224\")\\n```\\n\\n## AutoFeatureExtractor\\n\\nFor audio tasks, a feature extractor processes the audio signal the correct input format.\\n\\nLoad a feature extractor with [AutoFeatureExtractor.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor\\n\\n>>> feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\\n...     \"ehcalabres/wav2vec2-lg-xlsr-en-speech-emotion-recognition\"\\n... )\\n```\\n\\n## AutoProcessor\\n\\nMultimodal tasks require a processor that combines two types of preprocessing tools. For example, the [LayoutLMV2](model_doc/layoutlmv2) model requires an image processor to handle images and a tokenizer to handle text; a processor combines both of them.\\n\\nLoad a processor with [AutoProcessor.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoProcessor.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor\\n\\n>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/layoutlmv2-base-uncased\")\\n```\\n\\n## AutoModel\\n\\nFinally, the `AutoModelFor` classes let you load a pretrained model for a given task (see [here](model_doc/auto) for a complete list of available tasks). For example, load a model for sequence classification with [AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.FlaxAutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n>>> model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n```\\n\\nEasily reuse the same checkpoint to load an architecture for a different task:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification\\n\\n>>> model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n```\\n\\nFor PyTorch models, the `from_pretrained()` method uses `torch.load()` which internally uses `pickle` and is known to be insecure. In general, never load a model that could have come from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with. This security risk is partially mitigated for public models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub, which are [scanned for malware](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-malware) at each commit. See the [Hub documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security) for best practices like [signed commit verification](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-gpg#signing-commits-with-gpg) with GPG.\\n\\nTensorFlow and Flax checkpoints are not affected, and can be loaded within PyTorch architectures using the `from_tf` and `from_flax` kwargs for the `from_pretrained` method to circumvent this issue.\\n\\nGenerally, we recommend using the `AutoTokenizer` class and the `AutoModelFor` class to load pretrained instances of models. This will ensure you load the correct architecture every time. In the next [tutorial](preprocessing), learn how to use your newly loaded tokenizer, image processor, feature extractor and processor to preprocess a dataset for fine-tuning.\\n\\nFinally, the `TFAutoModelFor` classes let you load a pretrained model for a given task (see [here](model_doc/auto) for a complete list of available tasks). For example, load a model for sequence classification with [TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from\\\\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.FlaxAutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained):\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification\\n\\n>>> model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n```\\n\\nEasily reuse the same checkpoint to load an architecture for a different task:\\n\\n```\\n>>> from transformers import TFAutoModelForTokenClassification\\n\\n>>> model = TFAutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(\"distilbert-base-uncased\")\\n```\\n\\nGenerally, we recommend using the `AutoTokenizer` class and the `TFAutoModelFor` class to load pretrained instances of models.
