Amusing at times,\\nextremely pathetic and even painful at others, it not only contributes\\na necessary element to the Rougon-Macquart series of novels--a series\\nillustrative of all phases of life in France within certain dates--but\\nit also represents a particular period of M. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s own career and work.\\nSome years, indeed, before the latter had made himself known at all\\nwidely as a novelist, he had acquired among Parisian painters and\\nsculptors considerable notoriety as a revolutionary art critic, a\\nfervent champion of that â\\x80\\x98Open-airâ\\x80\\x99 school which came into being during\\nthe Second Empire, and which found its first real master in Edouard\\nManet, whose then derided works are regarded, in these later days, as\\nmasterpieces. Manet died before his genius was fully recognised; still\\nhe lived long enough to reap some measure of recognition and to see his\\ninfluence triumph in more than one respect among his brother artists.\\nIndeed, few if any painters left a stronger mark on the art of the\\nsecond half of the nineteenth century than he did, even though the\\nschool, which he suggested rather than established, lapsed largely into\\nmere impressionism--a term, by the way, which he himself coined already\\nin 1858; for it is an error to attribute it--as is often done--to his\\nfriend and junior, Claude Monet.\\n\\nIt was at the time of the Salon of 1866 that M. Zola, who criticised\\nthat exhibition in the _Evenement_ newspaper,* first came to the front\\nas an art critic, slashing out, to right and left, with all the vigour\\nof a born combatant, and championing M. Manet--whom he did not as yet\\nknow personally--with a fervour born of the strongest convictions. He\\nhad come to the conclusion that the derided painter was being treated\\nwith injustice, and that opinion sufficed to throw him into the fray;\\neven as, in more recent years, the belief that Captain Dreyfus was\\ninnocent impelled him in like manner to plead that unfortunate officerâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncause. When M. Zola first championed Manet and his disciples he was only\\ntwenty-six years old, yet he did not hesitate to pit himself against men\\nwho were regarded as the most eminent painters and critics of France;\\nand although (even as in the Dreyfus case) the only immediate result of\\nhis campaign was to bring him hatred and contumely, time, which always\\nhas its revenges, has long since shown how right he was in forecasting\\nthe ultimate victory of Manet and his principal methods.\\n\\n  * Some of the articles will be found in the volume of his\\n    miscellaneous writings entitled _Mes Haines_.\\n\\nIn those days M. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s most intimate friend--a companion of his boyhood\\nand youth--was Paul Cezanne, a painter who developed talent as an\\nimpressionist; and the lives of Cezanne and Manet, as well as that of\\na certain rather dissolute engraver, who sat for the latterâ\\x80\\x99s famous\\npicture _Le Bon Bock_, suggested to M. Zola the novel which he has\\ncalled _Lâ\\x80\\x99Oeuvre_. Claude Lantier, the chief character in the book, is,\\nof course, neither Cezanne nor Manet, but from the careers of those two\\npainters, M. Zola has borrowed many little touches and incidents.* The\\npoverty which falls to Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s lot is taken from the life of Cezanne,\\nfor Manet--the only son of a judge--was almost wealthy. Moreover, Manet\\nmarried very happily, and in no wise led the pitiful existence which in\\nthe novel is ascribed to Claude Lantier and his helpmate, Christine. The\\noriginal of the latter was a poor woman who for many years shared the\\nlife of the engraver to whom I have alluded; and, in that connection, it\\nas well to mention that what may be called the Bennecourt episode of the\\nnovel is virtually photographed from life.\\n\\n  * So far as Manet is concerned, the curious reader may consult M.\\n    Antonin Proustâ\\x80\\x99s interesting â\\x80\\x98Souvenirs,â\\x80\\x99 published in the _Revue\\n    Blanche_, early in 1897.\\n\\nWhilst, however, Claude Lantier, the hero of _Lâ\\x80\\x99Oeuvre_, is unlike\\nManet in so many respects, there is a close analogy between the artistic\\ntheories and practices of the real painter and the imaginary one.\\nSeveral of Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s pictures are Manetâ\\x80\\x99s, slightly modified. For\\ninstance, the formerâ\\x80\\x99s painting, â\\x80\\x98In the Open Air,â\\x80\\x99 is almost a replica\\nof the latterâ\\x80\\x99s _Dejeuner sur lâ\\x80\\x99Herbe_ [â\\x80\\x98A Lunch on the Grassâ\\x80\\x99), shown\\nat the Salon of the Rejected in 1863. Again, many of the sayings put\\ninto Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s mouth in the novel are really sayings of Manetâ\\x80\\x99s. And\\nClaudeâ\\x80\\x99s fate, at the end of the book, is virtually that of a moody\\nyoung fellow who long assisted Manet in his studio, preparing his\\npalette, cleaning his brushes, and so forth. This lad, whom Manet\\npainted in _Lâ\\x80\\x99Enfant aux Cerises_ [â\\x80\\x98The Boy with the Cherriesâ\\x80\\x99), had\\nartistic aspirations of his own and, being unable to justify them, ended\\nby hanging himself.\\n\\nI had just a slight acquaintance with Manet, whose studio I first\\nvisited early in my youth, and though the exigencies of life led me long\\nago to cast aside all artistic ambition of my own, I have been for\\nmore than thirty years on friendly terms with members of the French art\\nworld. Thus it would be comparatively easy for me to identify a\\nlarge number of the characters and the incidents figuring in â\\x80\\x98His\\nMasterpieceâ\\x80\\x99; but I doubt if such identification would have any\\nparticular interest for English readers. I will just mention that\\nMahoudeau, the sculptor, is, in a measure, Solari, another friend of\\nM. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s boyhood and youth; that Fagerolles, in his main features,\\nis Gervex; and that Bongrand is a commingling of Courbet, Cabanel and\\nGustave Flaubert. For instance, his so-called â\\x80\\x98Village Weddingâ\\x80\\x99 is\\nsuggested by Courbetâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Funeral at Ornansâ\\x80\\x99; his friendship for Claude is\\nCabanelâ\\x80\\x99s friendship for Manet; whilst some of his mannerisms, such as\\nhis dislike for the praise accorded to certain of his works, are simply\\nthose of Flaubert, who (like Balzac in the case of _Eugenie Grandet_)\\nalmost invariably lost his temper if one ventured to extol _Madame\\nBovary_ in his presence. Courbet, by the way, so far as disposition\\ngoes, crops up again in M. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s pages in the person of Champbouvard, a\\nsculptor, who, artistically, is a presentment of Clesinger.\\n\\nI now come to a personage of a very different character, Pierre Sandoz,\\nclerk, journalist, and novelist; and Sandoz, it may be frankly admitted,\\nis simply M. Zola himself. Personal appearance, life, habits, opinions,\\nall are those of the novelist at a certain period of his career; and\\nfor this reason, no doubt, many readers of â\\x80\\x98His Masterpieceâ\\x80\\x99 will find\\nSandoz the most interesting personage in the book. It is needless, I\\nthink, to enter into particulars on the subject. The reader may take\\nit from me that everything attributed in the following pages to Pierre\\nSandoz was done, experienced, felt or said by Emile Zola. In this\\nrespect, then â\\x80\\x98His Masterpieceâ\\x80\\x99 is virtually M. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98David\\nCopperfieldâ\\x80\\x99--the book into which he has put most of his real life. I\\nmay also mention, perhaps, that the long walks on the quays of Paris\\nwhich in the narrative are attributed to Claude Lantier are really M.\\nZolaâ\\x80\\x99s walks; for, in his youth, when he vainly sought employment\\nafter failing in his examinations, he was wont, at times of great\\ndiscouragement, to roam the Paris quays, studying their busy life\\nand their picturesque vistas, whenever he was not poring over the\\nsecond-hand books set out for sale upon their parapets. From a purely\\nliterary standpoint, the pictures of the quays and the Seine to be found\\nin _Lâ\\x80\\x99Oeuvre_ are perhaps the best bits of the book, though it is all\\nof interest, because it is essentially a _livre vecu_, a work really\\nâ\\x80\\x98livedâ\\x80\\x99 by its author. And if in the majority of its characters, those\\nreaders possessing some real knowledge of French art life find one manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nqualities blended with anotherâ\\x80\\x99s defects, the appearance of a third, and\\nthe habits of a fourth, the whole none the less makes a picture of great\\nfidelity to life and truth. This is the Parisian art world as it really\\nwas, with nothing improbable or overstrained in the narrative, save its\\nvery first chapter, in which romanticism is certainly allowed full play.\\n\\nIt is quite possible that some readers may not judge Claude Lantier, the\\nâ\\x80\\x98hero,â\\x80\\x99 very favourably; he is like the dog in the fable who forsakes\\nthe substance for the shadow; but it should be borne in mind that he is\\nonly in part responsible for his actions, for the fatal germ of insanity\\nhas been transmitted to him from his great-grandmother. He is, indeed,\\nthe son of Gervaise, the heroine of _Lâ\\x80\\x99Assommoir_ [â\\x80\\x98The Dram Shopâ\\x80\\x99), by\\nher lover Lantier. And Gervaise, it may be remembered, was the daughter\\nof Antoine Macquart (of â\\x80\\x98The Fortune of the Rougonsâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Dr. Pascalâ\\x80\\x99),\\nthe latter being the illegitimate son of Adelaide Fouque, from whom\\nsprang the insanity of the Rougon-Macquarts. At the same time, whatever\\nview may be taken of Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s artistic theories, whatever interest his\\nultimate fate may inspire, it cannot be denied that his opinions\\non painting are very ably expressed, and that his â\\x80\\x98case,â\\x80\\x99 from a\\npathological point of view, is diagnosticated by M. Zola with all the\\nskill of a physician. Moreover, there can be but one opinion concerning\\nthe helpmate of his life, the poor devoted Christine; and no one\\npossessed of feeling will be able to read the history of little Jacques\\nunmoved.\\n\\nStories of artistic life are not as a rule particularly popular with\\nEnglish readers, but this is not surprising when one remembers that\\nthose who take a genuine interest in art, in this country, are still a\\nsmall minority. Quite apart from artistic matters, however, there is, I\\nthink, an abundance of human interest in the pages of â\\x80\\x98His Masterpiece,â\\x80\\x99\\nand thus I venture to hope that the present version, which I have\\nprepared as carefully as my powers permit, will meet with the favour of\\nthose who have supported me, for a good many years now, in my endeavours\\nto make the majority of M. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s works accessible in this country.\\n\\n                                                              E. A. V.\\n\\n         MERTON, SURREY.\\n\\n\\n\\n                          HIS MASTERPIECE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nCLAUDE was passing in front of the Hotel de Ville, and the clock was\\nstriking two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning when the storm burst forth. He had\\nbeen roaming forgetfully about the Central Markets, during that burning\\nJuly night, like a loitering artist enamoured of nocturnal Paris.\\nSuddenly the raindrops came down, so large and thick, that he took to\\nhis heels and rushed, wildly bewildered, along the Quai de la Greve. But\\non reaching the Pont Louis Philippe he pulled up, ragefully breathless;\\nhe considered this fear of the rain to be idiotic; and so amid the\\npitch-like darkness, under the lashing shower which drowned the\\ngas-jets, he crossed the bridge slowly, with his hands dangling by his\\nside.\\n\\nHe had only a few more steps to go. As he was turning on to the Quai\\nBourbon, on the Isle of St. Louis, a sharp flash of lightning illumined\\nthe straight, monotonous line of old houses bordering the narrow road\\nin front of the Seine. It blazed upon the panes of the high, shutterless\\nwindows, showing up the melancholy frontages of the old-fashioned\\ndwellings in all their details; here a stone balcony, there the railing\\nof a terrace, and there a garland sculptured on a frieze. The painter\\nhad his studio close by, under the eaves of the old Hotel du Martoy,\\nnearly at the corner of the Rue de la Femme-sans-Tete.* So he went\\non while the quay, after flashing forth for a moment, relapsed into\\ndarkness, and a terrible thunder-clap shook the drowsy quarter.\\n\\n  * The street of the Headless woman.--ED.\\n\\nWhen Claude, blinded by the rain, got to his door--a low, rounded door,\\nstudded with iron--he fumbled for the bell knob, and he was exceedingly\\nsurprised--indeed, he started--on finding a living, breathing body\\nhuddled against the woodwork. Then, by the light of a second flash, he\\nperceived a tall young girl, dressed in black, and drenched already, who\\nwas shivering with fear. When a second thunder-clap had shaken both of\\nthem, Claude exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How you frighten one! Who are you, and what do you want?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe could no longer see her; he only heard her sob, and stammer:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, monsieur, donâ\\x80\\x99t hurt me. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the fault of the driver, whom I hired\\nat the station, and who left me at this door, after ill-treating me.\\nYes, a train ran off the rails, near Nevers. We were four hours late,\\nand a person who was to wait for me had gone. Oh, dear me; I have never\\nbeen in Paris before, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know where I am....â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnother blinding flash cut her short, and with dilated eyes she stared,\\nterror-stricken, at that part of the strange capital, that violet-tinted\\napparition of a fantastic city. The rain had ceased falling. On the\\nopposite bank of the Seine was the Quai des Ormes, with its small grey\\nhouses variegated below by the woodwork of their shops and with their\\nirregular roofs boldly outlined above, while the horizon suddenly became\\nclear on the left as far as the blue slate eaves of the Hotel de Ville,\\nand on the right as far as the leaden-hued dome of St. Paul. What\\nstartled her most of all, however, was the hollow of the stream, the\\ndeep gap in which the Seine flowed, black and turgid, from the heavy\\npiles of the Pont Marie, to the light arches of the new Pont Louis\\nPhilippe. Strange masses peopled the river, a sleeping flotilla of small\\nboats and yawls, a floating washhouse, and a dredger moored to the quay.\\nThen, farther down, against the other bank, were lighters, laden with\\ncoals, and barges full of mill stone, dominated as it were by the\\ngigantic arm of a steam crane. But, suddenly, everything disappeared\\nagain.\\n\\nClaude had an instinctive distrust of women--that story of an accident,\\nof a belated train and a brutal cabman, seemed to him a ridiculous\\ninvention. At the second thunder-clap the girl had shrunk farther still\\ninto her corner, absolutely terrified.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you cannot stop here all night,â\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\nShe sobbed still more and stammered, â\\x80\\x98I beseech you, monsieur, take me\\nto Passy. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s where I was going.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. Did she take him for a fool? Mechanically,\\nhowever, he turned towards the Quai des Celestins, where there was a\\ncabstand. Not the faintest glimmer of a lamp to be seen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98To Passy, my dear? Why not to Versailles? Where do you think one can\\npick up a cab at this time of night, and in such weather?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHer only answer was a shriek; for a fresh flash of lightning had almost\\nblinded her, and this time the tragic city had seemed to her to be\\nspattered with blood. An immense chasm had been revealed, the two\\narms of the river stretching far away amidst the lurid flames of a\\nconflagration. The smallest details had appeared: the little closed\\nshutters of the Quai des Ormes, and the two openings of the Rue de la\\nMasure, and the Rue du Paon-Blanc, which made breaks in the line of\\nfrontages; then near the Pont Marie one could have counted the leaves\\non the lofty plane trees, which there form a bouquet of magnificent\\nverdure; while on the other side, beneath the Pont Louis Philippe, at\\nthe Mail, the barges, ranged in a quadruple line, had flared with the\\npiles of yellow apples with which they were heavily laden. And there\\nwas also the ripple of the water, the high chimney of the floating\\nwashhouse, the tightened chain of the dredger, the heaps of sand on the\\nbanks, indeed, an extraordinary agglomeration of things, quite a little\\nworld filling the great gap which seemed to stretch from one horizon to\\nthe other. But the sky became dark again, and the river flowed on, all\\nobscurity, amid the crashing of the thunder.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thank heaven itâ\\x80\\x99s over. Oh, heaven! whatâ\\x80\\x99s to become of me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust then the rain began to fall again, so stiffly and impelled by so\\nstrong a wind that it swept along the quay with the violence of water\\nescaping through an open lock.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, let me get in,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude; â\\x80\\x98I can stand this no longer.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBoth were getting drenched. By the flickering light of the gas lamp at\\nthe corner of the Rue de la Femme-sans-Tete the young man could see the\\nwater dripping from the girlâ\\x80\\x99s dress, which was clinging to her skin, in\\nthe deluge that swept against the door. He was seized with compassion.\\nHad he not once picked up a cur on such a stormy night as this? Yet he\\nfelt angry with himself for softening. He never had anything to do with\\nwomen; he treated them all as if ignorant of their existence, with a\\npainful timidity which he disguised under a mask of bravado. And that\\ngirl must really think him a downright fool, to bamboozle him with that\\nstory of adventure--only fit for a farce. Nevertheless, he ended by\\nsaying, â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough. You had better come in out of the wet. You can\\nsleep in my rooms.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut at this the girl became even more frightened, and threw up her arms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98In your rooms? Oh! good heavens. No, no; itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible. I beseech\\nyou, monsieur, take me to Passy. Let me beg of you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Claude became angry. Why did she make all this fuss, when he was\\nwilling to give her shelter? He had already rung the bell twice. At last\\nthe door opened and he pushed the girl before him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no, monsieur; I tell you, no--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut another flash dazzled her, and when the thunder growled she bounded\\ninside, scarce knowing what she was about. The heavy door had closed\\nupon them, she was standing under a large archway in complete darkness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s I, Madame Joseph,â\\x80\\x99 cried Claude to the doorkeeper. Then he added,\\nin a whisper, â\\x80\\x98Give me your hand, we have to cross the courtyard.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe girl did as she was told; she no longer resisted; she was\\noverwhelmed, worn out. Once more they encountered the diluvian rain, as\\nthey ran side by side as hard as they could across the yard. It was a\\nbaronial courtyard, huge, and surrounded with stone arcades, indistinct\\namidst the gloom. However, they came to a narrow passage without a\\ndoor, and he let go her hand. She could hear him trying to strike some\\nmatches, and swearing. They were all damp. It was necessary for them to\\ngrope their way upstairs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Take hold of the banisters, and be careful,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude; â\\x80\\x98the steps\\nare very high.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe staircase, a very narrow one, a former servantsâ\\x80\\x99 staircase, was\\ndivided into three lofty flights, which she climbed, stumbling, with\\nunskilful, weary limbs. Then he warned her that they had to turn down a\\nlong passage. She kept behind him, touching the walls on both sides with\\nher outstretched hands, as she advanced along that endless passage which\\nbent and came back to the front of the building on the quay. Then there\\nwere still other stairs right under the roof--creaking, shaky wooden\\nstairs, which had no banister, and suggested the unplaned rungs of\\na millerâ\\x80\\x99s ladder. The landing at the top was so small that the girl\\nknocked against the young man, as he fumbled in his pocket for his key.\\nAt last, however, he opened the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t come in, but wait, else youâ\\x80\\x99ll hurt yourself again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe did not stir. She was panting for breath, her heart was beating\\nfast, there was a buzzing in her ears, and she felt indeed exhausted\\nby that ascent in the dense gloom. It seemed to her as if she had been\\nclimbing for hours, in such a maze, amidst such a turning and twisting\\nof stairs that she would never be able to find her way down again.\\nInside the studio there was a shuffling of heavy feet, a rustling of\\nhands groping in the dark, a clatter of things being tumbled about,\\naccompanied by stifled objurgations. At last the doorway was lighted up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come in, itâ\\x80\\x99s all right now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe went in and looked around her, without distinguishing anything. The\\nsolitary candle burned dim in that garret, more than fifteen feet high,\\nand filled with a confused jumble of things whose big shadows showed\\nfantastically on the walls, which were painted in grey distemper. No,\\nshe did not distinguish anything. She mechanically raised her eyes\\nto the large studio-window, against which the rain was beating with a\\ndeafening roll like that of a drum, but at that moment another flash\\nof lightning illumined the sky, followed almost immediately by a\\nthunder-clap that seemed to split the roof. Dumb-stricken, pale as\\ndeath, she dropped upon a chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The devil!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Claude, who also was rather pale. â\\x80\\x98That clap\\nwasnâ\\x80\\x99t far off. We were just in time. Itâ\\x80\\x99s better here than in the\\nstreets, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen he went towards the door, closed it with a bang and turned the key,\\nwhile she watched him with a dazed look.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, now, we are at home.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut it was all over. There were only a few more thunder-claps in the\\ndistance, and the rain soon ceased altogether. Claude, who was now\\ngrowing embarrassed, had examined the girl, askance. She seemed by no\\nmeans bad looking, and assuredly she was young: twenty at the most. This\\nscrutiny had the effect of making him more suspicious of her still,\\nin spite of an unconscious feeling, a vague idea, that she was not\\naltogether deceiving him. In any case, no matter how clever she might\\nbe, she was mistaken if she imagined she had caught him. To prove this\\nhe wilfully exaggerated his gruffness and curtness of manner.\\n\\nHer very anguish at his words and demeanour made her rise, and in her\\nturn she examined him, though without daring to look him straight in the\\nface. And the aspect of that bony young man, with his angular joints and\\nwild bearded face, increased her fears. With his black felt hat and\\nhis old brown coat, discoloured by long usage, he looked like a kind of\\nbrigand.\\n\\nDirectly he told her to make herself at home and go to bed, for he\\nplaced his bed at her disposal, she shrinkingly replied: â\\x80\\x98Thank you;\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll do very well as I am; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll not undress.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But your clothes are dripping,â\\x80\\x99 he retorted. â\\x80\\x98Come now, donâ\\x80\\x99t make an\\nidiot of yourself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd thereupon he began to knock about the chairs, and flung aside an old\\nscreen, behind which she noticed a washstand and a tiny iron bedstead,\\nfrom which he began to remove the coverlet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no, monsieur, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t worth while; I assure you that I shall stay\\nhere.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this, however, Claude became angry, gesticulating and shaking his\\nfists.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How much more of this comedy are we to have?â\\x80\\x99 said he. â\\x80\\x98As I give you\\nmy bed, what have you to complain of? You need not pay any attention to\\nme. I shall sleep on that couch.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe strode towards her with a threatening look, and thereupon, beside\\nherself with fear, thinking that he was going to strike her, she\\ntremblingly unfastened her hat. The water was dripping from her skirts.\\nHe kept on growling. Nevertheless, a sudden scruple seemed to come to\\nhim, for he ended by saying, condescendingly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Perhaps you donâ\\x80\\x99t like to sleep in my sheets. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll change them.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe at once began dragging them from the bed and flinging them on to the\\ncouch at the other end of the studio. And afterwards he took a clean\\npair from the wardrobe and began to make the bed with all the deftness\\nof a bachelor accustomed to that kind of thing. He carefully tucked in\\nthe clothes on the side near the wall, shook the pillows, and turned\\nback a corner of the coverlet.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do; wonâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\n\\nAnd as she did not answer, but remained motionless, he pushed her behind\\nthe screen. â\\x80\\x98Good heavens! what a lot of fuss,â\\x80\\x99 he thought. And after\\nspreading his own sheets on the couch, and hanging his clothes on an\\neasel, he quickly went to bed himself. When he was on the point of\\nblowing out the candle, however, he reflected that if he did so she\\nwould have to undress in the dark, and so he waited. At first he had\\nnot heard her stir; she had no doubt remained standing against the\\niron bedstead. But at last he detected a slight rustling, a slow,\\nfaint movement, as if amidst her preparations she also were listening,\\nfrightened perchance by the candle which was still alight. At last,\\nafter several minutes, the spring mattress creaked, and then all became\\nstill.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you comfortable, mademoiselle?â\\x80\\x99 now asked Claude, in a much more\\ngentle voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, monsieur, very comfortable,â\\x80\\x99 she replied, in a scarcely audible\\nvoice, which still quivered with emotion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very well, then. Good-night.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-night.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe blew out the candle, and the silence became more intense. In spite of\\nhis fatigue, his eyes soon opened again, and gazed upward at the large\\nwindow of the studio. The sky had become very clear again, the stars\\nwere twinkling in the sultry July night, and, despite the storm, the\\nheat remained oppressive. Claude was thinking about the girl--agitated\\nfor a moment by contrary feelings, though at last contempt gained\\nthe mastery. He indeed believed himself to be very strong-minded; he\\nimagined a romance concocted to destroy his tranquillity, and he gibed\\ncontentedly at having frustrated it. His experience of women was very\\nslight, nevertheless he endeavoured to draw certain conclusions from\\nthe story she had told him, struck as he was at present by certain petty\\ndetails, and feeling perplexed. But why, after all, should he worry his\\nbrain? What did it matter whether she had told him the truth or a lie?\\nIn the morning she would go off; there would be an end to it all, and\\nthey would never see each other again. Thus Claude lay cogitating, and\\nit was only towards daybreak, when the stars began to pale, that he\\nfell asleep. As for the girl behind the screen, in spite of the crushing\\nfatigue of her journey, she continued tossing about uneasily, oppressed\\nby the heaviness of the atmosphere beneath the hot zinc-work of the\\nroof; and doubtless, too, she was rendered nervous by the strangeness of\\nher surroundings.\\n\\nIn the morning, when Claude awoke, his eyes kept blinking. It was very\\nlate, and the sunshine streamed through the large window. One of his\\ntheories was, that young landscape painters should take studios despised\\nby the academical figure painters--studios which the sun flooded with\\nliving beams. Nevertheless he felt dazzled, and fell back again on his\\ncouch. Why the devil had he been sleeping there? His eyes, still heavy\\nwith sleep, wandered mechanically round the studio, when, all at once,\\nbeside the screen he noticed a heap of petticoats. Then he at\\nonce remembered the girl. He began to listen, and heard a sound of\\nlong-drawn, regular breathing, like that of a child comfortably asleep.\\nAh! so she was still slumbering, and so calmly, that it would be a pity\\nto disturb her. He felt dazed and somewhat annoyed at the adventure,\\nhowever, for it would spoil his morningâ\\x80\\x99s work. He got angry at his own\\ngood nature; it would be better to shake her, so that she might go\\nat once. Nevertheless he put on his trousers and slippers softly, and\\nwalked about on tiptoes.\\n\\nThe cuckoo clock struck nine, and Claude made a gesture of annoyance.\\nNothing had stirred; the regular breathing continued. The best thing to\\ndo, he thought, would be to set to work on his large picture; he would\\nsee to his breakfast later on, when he was able to move about. But,\\nafter all, he could not make up his mind. He who lived amid chronic\\ndisorder felt worried by that heap of petticoats lying on the floor.\\nSome water had dripped from them, but they were damp still. And so,\\nwhile grumbling in a low tone, he ended by picking them up one by one\\nand spreading them over the chairs in the sunlight. Had one ever seen\\nthe like, clothes thrown about anyhow? They would never get dry, and\\nshe would never go off! He turned all that feminine apparel over very\\nawkwardly, got entangled with the black dress-body, and went on all\\nfours to pick up the stockings that had fallen behind an old canvas.\\nThey were Balbriggan stockings of a dark grey, long and fine, and he\\nexamined them, before hanging them up to dry. The water oozing from the\\nedge of the dress had soaked them, so he wrung and stretched them with\\nhis warm hands, in order that he might be able to send her away the\\nquicker.\\n\\nSince he had been on his legs, Claude had felt sorely tempted to push\\naside the screen and to take a look at his guest. This self-condemned\\ncuriosity only increased his bad temper. At last, with his habitual\\nshrug of the shoulders, he was taking up his brushes, when he heard some\\nwords stammered amidst a rustling of bed-clothes. Then, however, soft\\nbreathing was heard again, and this time he yielded to the temptation,\\ndropping his brushes, and peeping from behind the screen. The sight that\\nmet his eyes rooted him to the spot, so fascinated that he muttered,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good gracious! good gracious!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe girl, amidst the hot-house heat that came from the window, had\\nthrown back her coverlet, and, overcome with the fatigue of a restless\\nnight, lay steeped in a flood of sunshine, unconscious of everything.\\nIn her feverish slumbers a shoulder button had become unfastened, and\\na sleeve slipping down allowed her bosom to be seen, with skin which\\nlooked almost gilded and soft like satin. Her right arm rested beneath\\nher neck, her head was thrown back, and her black unwound tresses\\nenwrapped her like a dusky cloak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good gracious! But sheâ\\x80\\x99s a beauty!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Claude once more.\\n\\nThere, in every point, was the figure he had vainly sought for his\\npicture, and it was almost in the right pose. She was rather spare,\\nperhaps, but then so lithe and fresh.\\n\\nWith a light step, Claude ran to take his box of crayons, and a large\\nsheet of paper. Then, squatting on a low chair, he placed a portfolio on\\nhis knees and began to sketch with an air of perfect happiness. All else\\nvanished amidst artistic surprise and enthusiasm. No thought of sex came\\nto him. It was all a mere question of chaste outlines, splendid flesh\\ntints, well-set muscles. Face to face with nature, an uneasy mistrust of\\nhis powers made him feel small; so, squaring his elbows, he became very\\nattentive and respectful. This lasted for about a quarter of an hour,\\nduring which he paused every now and then, blinking at the figure before\\nhim. As he was afraid, however, that she might change her position, he\\nspeedily set to work again, holding his breath, lest he should awaken\\nher.\\n\\nAnd yet, while steadily applying himself to his work, vague fancies\\nagain assailed his mind. Who could she be? Assuredly no mere hussy. But\\nwhy had she told him such an unbelievable tale? Thereupon he began to\\nimagine other stories. Perhaps she had but lately arrived in Paris with\\na lover, who had abandoned her; perhaps she was some young woman of the\\nmiddle classes led into bad company by a female friend, and not daring\\nto go home to her relatives; or else there was some still more intricate\\ndrama beneath it all; something horrible, inexplicable, the truth\\nof which he would never fathom. All these hypotheses increased his\\nperplexity. Meanwhile, he went on sketching her face, studying it with\\ncare. The whole of the upper part, the clear forehead, as smooth as\\na polished mirror, the small nose, with its delicately chiselled and\\nnervous nostrils, denoted great kindliness and gentleness. One divined\\nthe sweet smile of the eyes beneath the closed lids; a smile that would\\nlight up the whole of the features. Unfortunately, the lower part of the\\nface marred that expression of sweetness; the jaw was prominent, and the\\nlips, rather too full, showed almost blood-like over the strong white\\nteeth. There was here, like a flash of passion, something that spoke\\nof awakening womanhood, still unconscious of itself amidst those other\\ntraits of childlike softness.\\n\\nBut suddenly a shiver rippled over the girlâ\\x80\\x99s satiny skin. Perhaps\\nshe had felt the weight of that gaze thus mentally dissecting her. She\\nopened her eyes very wide and uttered a cry.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! great heavens!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSudden terror paralysed her at the sight of that strange room, and that\\nyoung man crouching in his shirt-sleeves in front of her and devouring\\nher with his eyes. Flushing hotly, she impulsively pulled up the\\ncounterpane.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x99 cried Claude, angrily, his crayon suspended\\nin mid-air; â\\x80\\x98what wasp has stung you now?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe, whose knowledge of womankind was largely limited to professional\\nmodels, was at a loss to understand the girlâ\\x80\\x99s action.\\n\\nShe neither spoke nor stirred, but remained with the counterpane tightly\\nwrapped round her throat, her body almost doubled up, and scarcely\\nshowing an outline beneath her coverings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I wonâ\\x80\\x99t eat you, will I?â\\x80\\x99 urged Claude. â\\x80\\x98Come, just lie as you were,\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s a good girl.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAgain she blushed to her very ears. At last she stammered, â\\x80\\x98Oh, no,\\nmonsieur, no--pray!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut he began to lose his temper altogether. One of the angry fits to\\nwhich he was subject was coming upon him. He thought her obstinacy\\nstupid. And as in response to his urgent requests she only began to sob,\\nhe quite lost his head in despair before his sketch, thinking that he\\nwould never be able to finish it, and would thus lose a capital study\\nfor his picture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t, eh? But itâ\\x80\\x99s idiotic. What do you take me for? Have\\nI annoyed you at all? You know I havenâ\\x80\\x99t. Besides, listen, it is very\\nunkind of you to refuse me this service, because, after all, I sheltered\\nyou--I gave up my bed to you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe only continued to cry, with her head buried in the pillow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I assure you that I am very much in want of this sketch, else I\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t worry you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe grew surprised at the girlâ\\x80\\x99s abundant tears, and ashamed at\\nhaving been so rough with her, so he held his tongue at last, feeling\\nembarrassed, and wishing too that she might have time to recover a bit.\\nThen he began again, in a very gentle tone:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, as it annoys you, letâ\\x80\\x99s say no more about it. But if you only\\nknew. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got a figure in my picture yonder which doesnâ\\x80\\x99t make head-way\\nat all, and you were just in the very note. As for me, when itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nquestion of painting, Iâ\\x80\\x99d kill father and mother, you know. Well, youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nexcuse me, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you? And if youâ\\x80\\x99d like me to be very nice, youâ\\x80\\x99d just\\ngive me a few minutes more. No, no; keep quiet as you are; I only want\\nthe head--nothing but the head. If I could finish that, it would be all\\nright. Really now, be kind; put your arm as it was before, and I shall\\nbe very grateful to you--grateful all my life long.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was he who was entreating now, pitifully waving his crayon amid\\nthe emotion of his artistic craving. Besides, he had not stirred, but\\nremained crouching on his low chair, at a distance from the bed. At last\\nshe risked the ordeal, and uncovered her tranquillised face. What else\\ncould she do? She was at his mercy, and he looked so wretchedly unhappy.\\n\\nNevertheless, she still hesitated, she felt some last scruples. But\\neventually, without saying a word, she slowly brought her bare arm from\\nbeneath the coverings, and again slipped it under her head, taking care,\\nhowever, to keep the counterpane tightly round her throat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! how kind you are! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make haste, you will be free in a minute.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe bent over his drawing, and only looked at her now and then with the\\nglance of a painter who simply regards the woman before him as a model.\\nAt first she became pink again; the consciousness that she was showing\\nher bare arm--which she would have shown in a ball-room without thinking\\nat all about it--filled her with confusion. Nevertheless, the young\\nman seemed so reasonable that she became reassured. The blush left her\\ncheeks, and her lips parted in a vague confiding smile. And from between\\nher half-opened eyelids she began to study him. How he had frightened\\nher the previous night with his thick brown beard, his large head, and\\nhis impulsive gestures. And yet he was not ugly; she even detected great\\ntenderness in the depths of his brown eyes, while his nose altogether\\nsurprised her. It was a finely-cut womanâ\\x80\\x99s nose, almost lost amidst the\\nbristling hair on his lips. He shook slightly with a nervous anxiety\\nwhich made his crayon seem a living thing in his slender hand, and\\nwhich touched her though she knew not why. She felt sure he was not\\nbad-natured, his rough, surly ways arose from bashfulness. She did not\\ndecipher all this very clearly, but she divined it, and began to put\\nherself at her ease, as if she were with a friend.\\n\\nNevertheless, the studio continued to frighten her a little. She\\ncast sidelong glances around it, astonished at so much disorder and\\ncarelessness. Before the stove the cinders of the previous winter still\\nlay in a heap. Besides the bed, the small washstand, and the couch,\\nthere was no other furniture than an old dilapidated oaken wardrobe and\\na large deal table, littered with brushes, colours, dirty plates, and\\na spirit lamp, atop of which was a saucepan, with shreds of vermicelli\\nsticking to its sides. Some rush-bottomed chairs, their seats the worse\\nfor wear, were scattered about beside spavined easels. Near the couch\\nthe candlestick used on the previous night stood on the floor, which\\nlooked as if it had not been swept for fully a month. There was only the\\ncuckoo clock, a huge one, with a dial illuminated with crimson flowers,\\nthat looked clean and bright, ticking sonorously all the while. But what\\nespecially frightened her were some sketches in oils that hung frameless\\nfrom the walls, a serried array of sketches reaching to the floor, where\\nthey mingled with heaps of canvases thrown about anyhow. She had never\\nseen such terrible painting, so coarse, so glaring, showing a violence\\nof colour, that jarred upon her nerves like a carterâ\\x80\\x99s oath heard on the\\ndoorstep of an inn. She cast her eyes down for a moment, and then became\\nattracted by a picture, the back of which was turned to her. It was\\nthe large canvas at which the painter was working, and which he pushed\\nagainst the wall every night, the better to judge it on the morrow\\nin the surprise of the first glance. What could it be, that one, she\\nwondered, since he dared not even show it? And, meantime, through the\\nvast room, a sheet of burning sunlight, falling straight from the window\\npanes, unchecked by any blind, spread with the flow of molten gold over\\nall the broken-down furniture, whose devil-may-care shabbiness it threw\\ninto bold relief.\\n\\nClaude began to feel the silence oppressive; he wanted to say something,\\nno matter what, first, in order to be polite, and more especially to\\ndivert her attention from her pose. But cudgel his brain as he would, he\\ncould only think of asking: â\\x80\\x98Pray, what is your name?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe opened her eyes, which she had closed, as if she were feeling\\nsleepy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Christine,â\\x80\\x99 she said.\\n\\nAt which he seemed surprised. Neither had he told her his name. Since\\nthe night before they had been together, side by side, without knowing\\none another.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My name is Claude.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd, having looked at her just at that moment, he saw her burst into\\na pretty laugh. It was the sudden, merry peal of a big girl, still\\nscarcely more than a hoyden. She considered this tardy exchange of names\\nrather droll. Then something else amused her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How funny--Claude, Christine--they begin with the same letter.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey both became silent once more. He was blinking at his work, growing\\nabsorbed in it, and at a loss how to continue the conversation. He\\nfancied that she was beginning to feel tired and uncomfortable, and in\\nhis fear lest she should stir, he remarked at random, merely to occupy\\nher thoughts, â\\x80\\x98It feels rather warm.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis time she checked her laughter, her natural gaiety that revived and\\nburst forth in spite of herself ever since she had felt easier in mind.\\nTruth to tell, the heat was indeed so oppressive that it seemed to her\\nas if she were in a bath, with skin moist and pale with the milky pallor\\nof a camellia.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, it feels rather warm,â\\x80\\x99 she said, seriously, though mirth was\\ndancing in her eyes.\\n\\nThereupon Claude continued, with a good-natured air:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s the sun falling straight in; but, after all, a flood of sunshine\\non oneâ\\x80\\x99s skin does one good. We could have done with some of it last\\nnight at the door, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t we?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this both burst out laughing, and he, delighted at having hit upon\\na subject of conversation, questioned her about her adventure, without,\\nhowever, feeling inquisitive, for he cared little about discovering the\\nreal truth, and was only intent upon prolonging the sitting.\\n\\nChristine simply, and in a few words, related what had befallen her.\\nEarly on the previous morning she had left Clermont for Paris, where\\nshe was to take up a situation as reader and companion to the widow of a\\ngeneral, Madame Vanzade, a rich old lady, who lived at Passy. The train\\nwas timed to reach Paris at ten minutes past nine in the evening, and\\na maid was to meet her at the station. They had even settled by letter\\nupon a means of recognition. She was to wear a black hat with a grey\\nfeather in it. But, a little above Nevers, her train had come upon a\\ngoods train which had run off the rails, its litter of smashed trucks\\nstill obstructing the line. There was quite a series of mishaps\\nand delays. First an interminable wait in the carriages, which the\\npassengers had to quit at last, luggage and all, in order to trudge to\\nthe next station, three kilometres distant, where the authorities had\\ndecided to make up another train. By this time they had lost two hours,\\nand then another two were lost in the general confusion which the\\naccident had caused from one end of the line to the other, in such wise\\nthat they reached the Paris terminus four hours behind time, that is, at\\none oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bad luck, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Claude, who was still sceptical,\\nthough half disarmed, in his surprise at the neat way in which the girl\\narranged the details of her story.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And, of course, there was no one at the station to meet you?â\\x80\\x99 he added.\\n\\nChristine had, indeed, missed Madame Vanzadeâ\\x80\\x99s maid, who, no doubt, had\\ngrown tired of waiting. She told Claude of her utter helplessness at the\\nLyons terminus--that large, strange, dark station, deserted at that late\\nhour of night. She had not dared to take a cab at first, but had kept\\non walking up and down, carrying her small bag, and still hoping that\\nsomebody would come for her. When at last she made up her mind there\\nonly remained one driver, very dirty and smelling of drink, who prowled\\nround her, offering his cab in a knowing, impudent way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, I know, a dawdler,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, getting as interested as if he\\nwere listening to a fairy tale. â\\x80\\x98So you got into his cab?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nLooking up at the ceiling, Christine continued, without shifting her\\nposition: â\\x80\\x98He made me; he called me his little dear, and frightened me.\\nWhen he found out that I was going to Passy, he became very angry, and\\nwhipped his horse so hard that I was obliged to hold on by the doors.\\nAfter that I felt more easy, because the cab trundled along all\\nright through the lighted streets, and I saw people about. At last I\\nrecognised the Seine, for though I was never in Paris before, I had\\noften looked at a map. Naturally I thought he would keep along the quay,\\nso I became very frightened again on noticing that we crossed a bridge.\\nJust then it began to rain, and the cab, which had got into a very\\ndark turning, suddenly stopped. The driver got down from his seat, and\\ndeclared it was raining too hard for him to remain on the box--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude burst out laughing. He no longer doubted. She could not have\\ninvented that driver. And as she suddenly stopped, somewhat confused, he\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98All right, the cabman was having a joke.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I jumped out at once by the other door,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Christine. â\\x80\\x98Then he\\nbegan to swear at me, saying that we had arrived at Passy, and that he\\nwould tear my hat from my head if I did not pay him. It was raining in\\ntorrents, and the quay was absolutely deserted. I was losing my head,\\nand when I had pulled out a five-franc piece, he whipped up his horse\\nand drove off, taking my little bag, which luckily only contained two\\npocket-handkerchiefs, a bit of cake, and the key of my trunk, which I\\nhad been obliged to leave behind in the train.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you ought to have taken his number,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed the artist\\nindignantly. In fact he now remembered having been brushed against by\\na passing cab, which had rattled by furiously while he was crossing the\\nPont Louis Philippe, amid the downpour of the storm. And he reflected\\nhow improbable truth often was. The story he had conjured up as being\\nthe most simple and logical was utterly stupid beside the natural chain\\nof lifeâ\\x80\\x99s many combinations.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You may imagine how I felt under the doorway,â\\x80\\x99 concluded Christine.\\nâ\\x80\\x98I knew well enough that I was not at Passy, and that I should have to\\nspend the night there, in this terrible Paris. And there was the thunder\\nand the lightning--those horrible blue and red flashes, which showed me\\nthings that made me tremble.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe closed her eyelids once more, she shivered, and the colour left her\\ncheeks as, in her fancy, she again beheld the tragic city--that line\\nof quays stretching away in a furnace-like blaze, the deep moat of the\\nriver, with its leaden waters obstructed by huge black masses, lighters\\nlooking like lifeless whales, and bristling with motionless cranes which\\nstretched forth gallows-like arms. Was that a welcome to Paris?\\n\\nAgain did silence fall. Claude had resumed his drawing. But she became\\nrestless, her arm was getting stiff.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just put your elbow a little lower, please,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude. Then, with an\\nair of concern, as if to excuse his curtness: â\\x80\\x98Your parents will be very\\nuneasy, if they have heard of the accident.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have no parents.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! neither father nor mother? You are all alone in the world?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes; all alone.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was eighteen years old, and had been born in Strasburg, quite by\\nchance, though, between two changes of garrison, for her father was a\\nsoldier, Captain Hallegrain. Just as she entered upon her twelfth year,\\nthe captain, a Gascon, hailing from Montauban, had died at Clermont,\\nwhere he had settled when paralysis of the legs had obliged him to\\nretire from active service. For nearly five years afterwards, her\\nmother, a Parisian by birth, had remained in that dull provincial town,\\nmanaging as well as she could with her scanty pension, but eking it\\nout by fan-painting, in order that she might bring up her daughter as a\\nlady. She had, however, now been dead for fifteen months, and had left\\nher child penniless and unprotected, without a friend, save the Superior\\nof the Sisters of the Visitation, who had kept her with them. Christine\\nhad come straight to Paris from the convent, the Superior having\\nsucceeded in procuring her a situation as reader and companion to her\\nold friend, Madame Vanzade, who was almost blind.\\n\\nAt these additional particulars, Claude sat absolutely speechless. That\\nconvent, that well-bred orphan, that adventure, all taking so romantic\\na turn, made him relapse into embarrassment again, into all his former\\nawkwardness of gesture and speech. He had left off drawing, and sat\\nlooking, with downcast eyes, at his sketch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is Clermont pretty?â\\x80\\x99 he asked, at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not very; itâ\\x80\\x99s a gloomy town. Besides, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know; I scarcely ever\\nwent out.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was resting on her elbow, and continued, as if talking to herself in\\na very low voice, still tremulous from the thought of her bereavement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Mamma, who wasnâ\\x80\\x99t strong, killed herself with work. She spoilt me;\\nnothing was too good for me. I had all sorts of masters, but I did not\\nget on very well; first, because I fell ill, then because I paid no\\nattention. I was always laughing and skipping about like a featherbrain.\\nI didnâ\\x80\\x99t care for music, piano playing gave me a cramp in my arms. The\\nonly thing I cared about at all was painting.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe raised his head and interrupted her. â\\x80\\x98You can paint?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, no; I know nothing, nothing at all. Mamma, who was very talented,\\nmade me do a little water-colour, and I sometimes helped her with the\\nbackgrounds of her fans. She painted some lovely ones.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn spite of herself, she then glanced at the startling sketches with\\nwhich the walls seemed ablaze, and her limpid eyes assumed an uneasy\\nexpression at the sight of that rough, brutal style of painting. From\\nwhere she lay she obtained a topsy-turvy view of the study of herself\\nwhich the painter had begun, and her consternation at the violent tones\\nshe noticed, the rough crayon strokes, with which the shadows were\\ndashed off, prevented her from asking to look at it more closely.\\nBesides, she was growing very uncomfortable in that bed, where she lay\\nbroiling; she fidgetted with the idea of going off and putting an end to\\nall these things which, ever since the night before, had seemed to her\\nso much of a dream.\\n\\nClaude, no doubt, became aware of her discomfort. A sudden feeling of\\nshame brought with it one of compunction.\\n\\nHe put his unfinished sketch aside, and hastily exclaimed: â\\x80\\x98Much obliged\\nfor your kindness, mademoiselle. Forgive me, I have really abused it.\\nYes, indeed, pray get up; itâ\\x80\\x99s time for you to look for your friends.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd without appearing to understand why she did not follow his advice,\\nbut hid more and more of her bare arm in proportion as he drew nearer,\\nhe still insisted upon advising her to rise. All at once, as the real\\nstate of things struck him, he swung his arms about like a madman, set\\nthe screen in position, and went to the far end of the studio, where he\\nbegan noisily setting his crockery in order, so that she might jump out\\nand dress herself, without fear of being overheard.\\n\\nAmidst the din he had thus raised, he failed to hear her hesitating\\nvoice, â\\x80\\x98Monsieur, monsieur--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt last he caught her words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Monsieur, would you be so kind--I canâ\\x80\\x99t find my stockings.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude hurried forward. What had he been thinking of? What was she to do\\nbehind that screen, without her stockings and petticoats, which he had\\nspread out in the sunlight? The stockings were dry, he assured himself\\nof that by gently rubbing them together, and he handed them to her over\\nthe partition; again noticing her arm, bare, plump and rosy like that of\\na child. Then he tossed the skirts on to the foot of the bed and pushed\\nher boots forward, leaving nothing but her bonnet suspended from the\\neasel. She had thanked him and that was all; he scarcely distinguished\\nthe rustling of her clothes and the discreet splashing of water. Still\\nhe continued to concern himself about her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You will find the soap in a saucer on the table. Open the drawer and\\ntake a clean towel. Do you want more water? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give you the pitcher.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSuddenly the idea that he was blundering again exasperated him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, there, I am only worrying you. I will leave you to your own\\ndevices. Do as if you were at home.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he continued to potter about among the crockery. He was debating\\nwith himself whether he should ask her to stay to breakfast. He ought\\nnot to let her go like that. On the other hand, if she did stay, he\\nwould never get done; it would mean a loss of his whole morning. Without\\ndeciding anything, as soon as he had lighted his spirit lamp, he washed\\nhis saucepan and began to make some chocolate. He thought it more\\n_distingue_, feeling rather ashamed of his vermicelli, which he mixed\\nwith bread and soused with oil as people do in the South of France.\\nHowever, he was still breaking the chocolate into bits, when he uttered\\na cry of surprise, â\\x80\\x98What, already?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was Christine, who had pushed back the screen, and who appeared\\nlooking neat and correct in her black dress, duly laced and buttoned\\nup, equipped, as it were, in a twinkle. Her rosy face did not even show\\ntraces of the water, her thick hair was twisted in a knot at the back\\nof her head, not a single lock out of place. And Claude remained\\nopen-mouthed before that miracle of quickness, that proof of feminine\\nskill in dressing well and promptly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The deuce, if you go about everything in that way!â\\x80\\x99 said he.\\n\\nHe found her taller and handsomer than he had fancied. But what struck\\nhim most was her look of quiet decision. She was evidently no longer\\nafraid of him. It seemed as though she had re-donned her armour and\\nbecome an amazon again. She smiled and looked him straight in the face.\\nWhereupon he said what he was still reluctant to say:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll breakfast with me, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut she refused the offer. â\\x80\\x98No, thank you. I am going to the station,\\nwhere my trunk must have arrived by now, and then I shall drive to\\nPassy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was in vain that he told her that she must be hungry, that it was\\nunreasonable for her to go out without eating something.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, if you wonâ\\x80\\x99t, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go down and fetch you a cab,â\\x80\\x99 he ended by\\nexclaiming.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pray donâ\\x80\\x99t take such trouble.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you canâ\\x80\\x99t go such a distance on foot. Let me at least take you to\\nthe cabstand, as you donâ\\x80\\x99t know Paris.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, really I do not need you. If you wish to oblige me, let me go away\\nby myself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had evidently made up her mind. She no doubt shrank from the idea\\nof being seen with a man, even by strangers. She meant to remain silent\\nabout that strange night, she meant to tell some falsehood, and keep\\nthe recollection of her adventure entirely to herself. He made a\\nfurious gesture, which was tantamount to sending her to the devil. Good\\nriddance; it suited him better not to have to go down. But, all the\\nsame, he felt hurt at heart, and considered that she was ungrateful.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As you please, then. I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t resort to force,â\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\nAt these words, Christineâ\\x80\\x99s vague smile became more accentuated. She did\\nnot reply, but took her bonnet and looked round in search of a glass.\\nFailing to find one, she tied the strings as best she could. With her\\narms uplifted, she leisurely arranged and smoothed the ribbons, her face\\nturned towards the golden rays of the sun. Somewhat surprised, Claude\\nlooked in vain for the traits of childish softness that he had just\\nportrayed; the upper part of her face, her clear forehead, her gentle\\neyes had become less conspicuous; and now the lower part stood out, with\\nits somewhat sensual jaw, ruddy mouth, and superb teeth. And still she\\nsmiled with that enigmatical, girlish smile, which was, perhaps, an\\nironical one.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98At any rate,â\\x80\\x99 he said, in a vexed tone, â\\x80\\x98I do not think you have\\nanything to reproach me with.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt which she could not help laughing, with a slight, nervous laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no, monsieur, not in the least.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe continued staring at her, fighting the battle of inexperience and\\nbashfulness over again, and fearing that he had been ridiculous. Now\\nthat she no longer trembled before him, had she become contemptuously\\nsurprised at having trembled at all? What! he had not made the slightest\\nattempt at courtship, not even pressed a kiss on her finger-tips. The\\nyoung fellowâ\\x80\\x99s bearish indifference, of which she had assuredly been\\nconscious, must have hurt her budding womanly feelings.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You were saying,â\\x80\\x99 she resumed, becoming sedate once more, â\\x80\\x98that the\\ncabstand is at the end of the bridge on the opposite quay?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes; at the spot where there is a clump of trees.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had finished tying her bonnet strings, and stood ready gloved,\\nwith her hands hanging by her side, and yet she did not go, but stared\\nstraight in front of her. As her eyes met the big canvas turned to\\nthe wall she felt a wish to see it, but did not dare to ask. Nothing\\ndetained her; still she seemed to be looking around as if she had\\nforgotten something there, something which she could not name. At last\\nshe stepped towards the door.\\n\\nClaude was already opening it, and a small loaf placed erect against the\\npost tumbled into the studio.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You see,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98you ought to have stopped to breakfast with me. My\\ndoorkeeper brings the bread up every morning.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe again refused with a shake of the head. When she was on the landing\\nshe turned round, and for a moment remained quite still. Her gay smile\\nhad come back; she was the first to hold out her hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thank you, thank you very much.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had taken her small gloved hand within his large one, all\\npastel-stained as it was. Both hands remained like that for a few\\nmoments, closely and cordially pressed. The young girl was still smiling\\nat him, and he had a question on the tip of his tongue: â\\x80\\x98When shall I\\nsee you again?â\\x80\\x99 But he felt ashamed to ask it, and after waiting a while\\nshe withdrew her hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-bye, monsieur.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-bye, mademoiselle.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine, without another glance, was already descending the steep\\nladder-like stairway whose steps creaked, when Claude turned abruptly\\ninto his studio, closing the door with a bang, and shouting to himself:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, those confounded women!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was furious--furious with himself, furious with everyone. Kicking\\nabout the furniture, he continued to ease his feelings in a loud voice.\\nWas not he right in never allowing them to cross his threshold? They\\nonly turned a fellowâ\\x80\\x99s head. What proof had he after all that yonder\\nchit with the innocent look, who had just gone, had not fooled him most\\nabominably? And he had been silly enough to believe in her cock-and-bull\\nstories! All his suspicions revived. No one would ever make him swallow\\nthat fairy tale of the generalâ\\x80\\x99s widow, the railway accident, and\\nespecially the cabman. Did such things ever happen in real life?\\nBesides, that mouth of hers told a strange tale, and her looks had\\nbeen very singular just as she was going. Ah! if he could only have\\nunderstood why she had told him all those lies; but no, they were\\nprofitless, inexplicable. It was art for artâ\\x80\\x99s sake. How she must be\\nlaughing at him by this time.\\n\\nHe roughly folded up the screen and sent it flying into a corner. She\\nhad no doubt left all in disorder. And when he found that everything was\\nin its proper place--basin, towel, and soap--he flew into a rage because\\nshe had not made the bed. With a great deal of fuss he began to make it\\nhimself, lifting the mattress in his arms, banging the pillow about with\\nhis fists, and feeling oppressed by the pure scent of youth that rose\\nfrom everything. Then he had a good wash to cool himself, and in the\\ndamp towel he found the same virgin fragrance, which seemed to spread\\nthrough the studio. Swearing the while, he drank his chocolate from\\nthe saucepan, so excited, so eager to set to work, as to swallow large\\nmouthfuls of bread without taking breath.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, itâ\\x80\\x99s enough to kill one here,â\\x80\\x99 he suddenly exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98It must be\\nthis confounded heat thatâ\\x80\\x99s making me ill.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAfter all, the sun had shifted, and it was far less hot. But he opened\\na small window on a level with the roof, and inhaled, with an air of\\nprofound relief, the whiff of warm air that entered. Then he took up his\\nsketch of Christineâ\\x80\\x99s head and for a long while he lingered looking at\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nIT had struck twelve, and Claude was working at his picture when\\nthere was a loud, familiar knock at the door. With an instinctive yet\\ninvoluntary impulse, the artist slipped the sketch of Christineâ\\x80\\x99s head,\\nby the aid of which he was remodelling the principal figure of his\\npicture, into a portfolio. After which he decided to open the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You, Pierre!â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98already!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nPierre Sandoz, a friend of his boyhood, was about twenty-two, very dark,\\nwith a round and determined head, a square nose, and gentle eyes, set in\\nenergetic features, girt round with a sprouting beard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I breakfasted earlier than usual,â\\x80\\x99 he answered, â\\x80\\x98in order to give you a\\nlong sitting. The devil! you are getting on with it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had stationed himself in front of the picture, and he added almost\\nimmediately: â\\x80\\x98Hallo! you have altered the character of your womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfeatures!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen came a long pause; they both kept staring at the canvas. It\\nmeasured about sixteen feet by ten, and was entirely painted over,\\nthough little of the work had gone beyond the roughing-out. This\\nroughing-out, hastily dashed off, was superb in its violence and ardent\\nvitality of colour. A flood of sunlight streamed into a forest clearing,\\nwith thick walls of verdure; to the left, stretched a dark glade with a\\nsmall luminous speck in the far distance. On the grass, amidst all the\\nsummer vegetation, lay a nude woman with one arm supporting her head,\\nand though her eyes were closed she smiled amidst the golden shower that\\nfell around her. In the background, two other women, one fair, and the\\nother dark, wrestled playfully, setting light flesh tints amidst all the\\ngreen leaves. And, as the painter had wanted something dark by way of\\ncontrast in the foreground, he had contented himself with seating there\\na gentleman, dressed in a black velveteen jacket. This gentleman had\\nhis back turned and the only part of his flesh that one saw was his left\\nhand, with which he was supporting himself on the grass.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The woman promises well,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, at last; â\\x80\\x98but, dash it, there\\nwill be a lot of work in all this.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, with his eyes blazing in front of his picture, made a gesture\\nof confidence. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lots of time from now till the Salon. One can get\\nthrough a deal of work in six months. And perhaps this time Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be able\\nto prove that I am not a brute.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon he set up a whistle, inwardly pleased at the sketch he had\\nmade of Christineâ\\x80\\x99s head, and buoyed up by one of those flashes of hope\\nwhence he so often dropped into torturing anguish, like an artist whom\\npassion for nature consumed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, no more idling,â\\x80\\x99 he shouted. â\\x80\\x98As youâ\\x80\\x99re here, let us set to.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz, out of pure friendship, and to save Claude the cost of a model,\\nhad offered to pose for the gentleman in the foreground. In four or five\\nSundays, the only day of the week on which he was free, the figure would\\nbe finished. He was already donning the velveteen jacket, when a sudden\\nreflection made him stop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, I say, you havenâ\\x80\\x99t really lunched, since you were working when I\\ncame in. Just go down and have a cutlet while I wait here.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe idea of losing time revolted Claude. â\\x80\\x98I tell you I have breakfasted.\\nLook at the saucepan. Besides, you can see thereâ\\x80\\x99s a crust of bread\\nleft. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll eat it. Come, to work, to work, lazy-bones.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he snatched up his palette and caught his brushes, saying, as he did\\nso, â\\x80\\x98Dubuche is coming to fetch us this evening, isnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, about five oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right then. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll go down to dinner directly he comes.\\nAre you ready? The hand more to the left, and your head a little more\\nforward.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHaving arranged some cushions, Sandoz settled himself on the couch\\nin the required attitude. His back was turned, but all the same the\\nconversation continued for another moment, for he had that very morning\\nreceived a letter from Plassans, the little Provencal town where he and\\nthe artist had known each other when they were wearing out their first\\npairs of trousers on the eighth form of the local college. However, they\\nleft off talking. The one was working with his mind far away from the\\nworld, while the other grew stiff and cramped with the sleepy weariness\\nof protracted immobility.\\n\\nIt was only when Claude was nine years old that a lucky chance had\\nenabled him to leave Paris and return to the little place in Provence,\\nwhere he had been born. His mother, a hardworking laundress,* whom his\\nneâ\\x80\\x99er-do-well father had scandalously deserted, had afterwards married\\nan honest artisan who was madly in love with her. But in spite of\\ntheir endeavours, they failed to make both ends meet. Hence they gladly\\naccepted the offer of an elderly and well-to-do townsman to send the\\nlad to school and keep him with him. It was the generous freak of an\\neccentric amateur of painting, who had been struck by the little figures\\nthat the urchin had often daubed. And thus for seven years Claude had\\nremained in the South, at first boarding at the college, and afterwards\\nliving with his protector. The latter, however, was found dead in his\\nbed one morning. He left the lad a thousand francs a year, with the\\nfaculty of disposing of the principal when he reached the age of\\ntwenty-five. Claude, already seized with a passion for painting,\\nimmediately left school without even attempting to secure a bachelorâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndegree, and rushed to Paris whither his friend Sandoz had preceded him.\\n\\n  * Gervaise of â\\x80\\x98The Dram Shopâ\\x80\\x99 (Lâ\\x80\\x99Assommoir).--ED.\\n\\nAt the College of Plassans, while still in the lowest form, Claude\\nLantier, Pierre Sandoz, and another lad named Louis Dubuche, had been\\nthree inseparables. Sprung from three different classes of society, by\\nno means similar in character, but simply born in the same year at a few\\nmonthsâ\\x80\\x99 interval, they had become friends at once and for aye, impelled\\nthereto by certain secret affinities, the still vague promptings of\\na common ambition, the dawning consciousness of possessing greater\\nintelligence than the set of dunces who maltreated them. Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfather, a Spaniard, who had taken refuge in France in consequence of\\nsome political disturbances in which he had been mixed up, had started,\\nnear Plassans, a paper mill with new machinery of his own invention.\\nWhen he had died, heart-broken by the petty local jealousy that had\\nsought to hamper him in every way, his widow had found herself in so\\ninvolved a position, and burdened with so many tangled law suits, that\\nthe whole of her remaining means were swallowed up. She was a native of\\nBurgundy. Yielding to her hatred of the Provencals, and laying at their\\ndoor even the slow paralysis from which she was suffering, she removed\\nto Paris with her son, who then supported her out of a meagre clerkâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsalary, he himself haunted by the vision of literary glory. As for\\nDubuche, he was the son of a baker of Plassans. Pushed by his mother, a\\ncovetous and ambitious woman, he had joined his friends in Paris later\\non. He was attending the courses at the School of Arts as a pupil\\narchitect, living as best he might upon the last five-franc pieces\\nthat his parents staked on his chances, with the obstinacy of usurers\\ndiscounting the future at the rate of a hundred per cent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dash it!â\\x80\\x99 at last exclaimed Sandoz, breaking the intense silence that\\nhung upon the room. â\\x80\\x98This position isnâ\\x80\\x99t at all easy; my wrist feels\\nbroken. Can I move for a moment?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude let him stretch himself without answering. He was now working at\\nthe velveteen jacket, laying on the colour with thick strokes, However,\\nstepping backward and blinking, he suddenly burst into loud laughter at\\nsome reminiscence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, do you recollect, when we were in the sixth form, how, one day,\\nPouillaud lighted the candles in that idiot Lalubieâ\\x80\\x99s cupboard? And how\\nfrightened Lalubie was when, before going to his desk, he opened the\\ncupboard to take his books, and found it transformed into a mortuary\\nchapel? Five hundred lines to every one in the form.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz, unable to withstand the contagion of the otherâ\\x80\\x99s gaiety, flung\\nhimself back on the couch. As he resumed his pose, he remarked, â\\x80\\x98Ah,\\nthat brute of a Pouillaud. You know that in his letter this morning he\\ntells me of Lalubieâ\\x80\\x99s forthcoming marriage. The old hack is marrying\\na pretty girl. But you know her, sheâ\\x80\\x99s the daughter of Gallissard, the\\nhaberdasher--the little fair-haired girl whom we used to serenade!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOnce on the subject of their recollections there was no stopping them,\\nthough Claude went on painting with growing feverishness, while Pierre,\\nstill turned towards the wall, spoke over his shoulders, shaking every\\nnow and then with excitement.\\n\\nFirst of all came recollections of the college, the old, dank convent,\\nthat extended as far as the town ramparts; the two courtyards with their\\nhuge plane trees; the slimy sedge-covered pond, where they had learned\\nto swim, and the class-rooms with dripping plaster walls on the ground\\nfloor; then the refectory, with its atmosphere constantly poisoned by\\nthe fumes of dish-water; the dormitory of the little ones, famous for\\nits horrors, the linen room, and the infirmary, full of gentle sisters,\\nnuns in black gowns who looked so sweet beneath their white coifs. What\\na to-do there had been when Sister Angela, she whose Madonna-like face\\nhad turned the heads of all the big fellows, disappeared one morning\\nwith Hermeline, a stalwart first-form lad, who, from sheer love,\\npurposely cut his hands with his penknife so as to get an opportunity of\\nseeing and speaking to her while she dressed his self-inflicted injuries\\nwith gold-beaterâ\\x80\\x99s skin.\\n\\nThen they passed the whole college staff in review; a pitiful,\\ngrotesque, and terrible procession it was, with such heads as are seen\\non meerschaum pipes, and profiles instinct with hatred and suffering.\\nThere was the head master, who ruined himself in giving parties, in\\norder to marry his daughters--two tall, elegant girls, the butt of\\nconstant and abominable insults, written and sketched on every wall;\\nthere was the comptroller Pifard, whose wonderful nose betrayed his\\npresence behind every door, when he went eavesdropping; and there were\\nall the teachers, each befouled with some insulting nickname: the severe\\nâ\\x80\\x98Rhadamantus,â\\x80\\x99 who had never been seen to smile; â\\x80\\x98Filth,â\\x80\\x99 who by the\\nconstant rubbing of his head had left his mark on the wall behind\\nevery professional seat he occupied; â\\x80\\x98Thou-hast-deceived-me-Adele,â\\x80\\x99\\nthe professor of physics, at whom ten generations of schoolboys had\\ntauntingly flung the name of his unfaithful wife. There were others\\nstill: Spontini, the ferocious usher, with his Corsican knife, rusty\\nwith the blood of three cousins; little Chantecaille, who was so\\ngood-natured that he allowed the pupils to smoke when out walking; and\\nalso a scullion and a scullery maid, two ugly creatures who had been\\nnicknamed Paraboulomenos and Paralleluca, and who were accused of\\nkissing one another over the vegetable parings.\\n\\nThen came comical reminiscences; the sudden recollection of practical\\njokes, at which they shook with laughter after all those years. Oh!\\nthe morning when they had burned the shoes of Mimi-la-Mort, _alias_ the\\nSkeleton Day Boarder, a lank lad, who smuggled snuff into the school for\\nthe whole of the form. And then that winter evening when they had bagged\\nsome matches lying near the lamp in the chapel, in order to smoke dry\\nchestnut leaves in reed pipes. Sandoz, who had been the ringleader on\\nthat occasion, now frankly avowed his terror; the cold perspiration\\nthat had come upon him when he had scrambled out of the choir, wrapt\\nin darkness. And again there was the day when Claude had hit upon the\\nsublime idea of roasting some cockchafers in his desk to see whether\\nthey were good to eat, as people said they were. So terrible had been\\nthe stench, so dense the smoke that poured from the desk, that the usher\\nhad rushed to the water pitcher, under the impression that the place was\\non fire. And then their marauding expeditions; the pillaging of onion\\nbeds while they were out walking; the stones thrown at windows,\\nthe correct thing being to make the breakage resemble a well-known\\ngeographical map. Also the Greek exercises, written beforehand in large\\ncharacters on the blackboard, so that every dunce might easily read\\nthem though the master remained unaware of it; the wooden seats of the\\ncourtyard sawn off and carried round the basin like so many corpses, the\\nboys marching in procession and singing funeral dirges. Yes! that had\\nbeen a capital prank. Dubuche, who played the priest, had tumbled into\\nthe basin while trying to scoop some water into his cap, which was to\\nserve as a holy water pot. But the most comical and amusing of all the\\npranks had perhaps been that devised by Pouillaud, who one night had\\nfastened all the unmentionable crockery of the dormitory to one long\\nstring passed under the beds. At dawn--it was the very morning when the\\nlong vacation began--he had pulled the string and skedaddled down the\\nthree flights of stairs with this frightful tail of crockery bounding\\nand smashing to pieces behind him.\\n\\nAt the recollection of this last incident, Claude remained grinning from\\near to ear, his brush suspended in mid-air. â\\x80\\x98That brute of a Pouillaud!â\\x80\\x99\\nhe laughed. â\\x80\\x98And so he has written to you. What is he doing now?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, nothing at all, old man,â\\x80\\x99 answered Sandoz, seating himself\\nmore comfortably on the cushions. â\\x80\\x98His letter is idiotic. He is just\\nfinishing his law studies, and he will inherit his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s practice as\\na solicitor. You ought to see the style he has already assumed--all the\\nidiotic austerity of a philistine, who has turned over a new leaf.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey were silent once more until Sandoz added, â\\x80\\x98You see, old boy, we\\nhave been protected against that sort of thing.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen they relapsed again into reminiscences, but such as made their\\nhearts thump; the remembrance of the many happy days they had spent far\\naway from the college, in the open air and the full sunlight. When\\nstill very young, and only in the sixth form, the three inseparables\\nhad become passionately fond of taking long walks. The shortest holidays\\nwere eagerly seized upon to tramp for miles and miles; and, getting\\nbolder as they grew up, they finished by scouring the whole of the\\ncountry-side, by making journeys that sometimes lasted for days. They\\nslept where they could, in the cleft of a rock, on some threshing-floor,\\nstill burning hot, where the straw of the beaten corn made them a soft\\ncouch, or in some deserted hut, the ground of which they covered with\\nwild thyme and lavender. Those were flights far from the everyday world,\\nwhen they became absorbed in healthy mother Nature herself, adoring\\ntrees and streams and mountains; revelling in the supreme joy of being\\nalone and free.\\n\\nDubuche, who was a boarder, had only joined them on half-holidays and\\nduring the long vacation. Besides, his legs were heavy, and he had the\\nquiet nature of a studious lad. But Claude and Sandoz never wearied;\\nthey awakened each other every Sunday morning by throwing stones at\\ntheir respective shutters. In summer, above all, they were haunted by\\nthe thought of the Viorne, the torrent, whose tiny stream waters the\\nlow-lying pastures of Plassans. When scarcely twelve they already knew\\nhow to swim, and it became a passion with them to potter about in the\\nholes where the water accumulated; to spend whole days there, stark\\nnaked, drying themselves on the burning sand, and then replunging into\\nthe river, living there as it were, on their backs, on their stomachs,\\nsearching among the reeds on the banks, immersed up to their ears, and\\nwatching the hiding-places of the eels for hours at a stretch. That\\nconstant contact of water beneath a burning sun prolonged their\\nchildhood, as it were, and lent them the joyous laughter of truant\\nurchins, though they were almost young men, when of an evening they\\nreturned to the town amidst the still oppressive heat of a summer\\nsunset. Later on they became very fond of shooting, but shooting such\\nas is carried on in a region devoid of game, where they had to trudge\\na score of miles to pick off half a dozen pettychaps, or fig-peckers;\\nwonderful expeditions, whence they returned with their bags empty, or\\nwith a mere bat, which they had managed to bring down while discharging\\ntheir guns at the outskirts of the town. Their eyes moistened at the\\nrecollection of those happy days; they once more beheld the white\\nendless roads, covered with layers of dust, as if there had been a fall\\nof snow. They paced them again and again in their imagination, happy to\\nhear the fancied creaking of their heavy shoes. Then they cut across the\\nfields, over the reddish-brown ferruginous soil, careering madly on\\nand on; and there was a sky of molten lead above them, not a shadow\\nanywhere, nothing but dwarf olive trees and almond trees with scanty\\nfoliage. And then the delicious drowsiness of fatigue on their return,\\ntheir triumphant bravado at having covered yet more ground than on the\\nprecious journey, the delight of being no longer conscious of effort,\\nof advancing solely by dint of strength acquired, spurring themselves on\\nwith some terrible martial strain which helped to make everything like a\\ndream.\\n\\nAlready at that time Claude, in addition to his powder-flask and\\ncartridge-belt, took with him an album, in which he sketched little bits\\nof country, while Sandoz, on his side, always had some favourite poet\\nin his pocket. They lived in a perfect frenzy of romanticism, winged\\nstrophes alternated with coarse garrison stories, odes were flung upon\\nthe burning, flashing, luminous atmosphere that enwrapt them. And when\\nperchance they came upon a small rivulet, bordered by half a dozen\\nwillows, casting grey shadows on the soil all ablaze with colour, they\\nat once went into the seventh heaven. They there by themselves performed\\nthe dramas they knew by heart, inflating their voices when repeating\\nthe speeches of the heroes, and reducing them to the merest whisper when\\nthey replied as queens and love-sick maidens. On such days the sparrows\\nwere left in peace. In that remote province, amidst the sleepy stupidity\\nof that small town, they had thus lived on from the age of fourteen,\\nfull of enthusiasm, devoured by a passion for literature and art. The\\nmagnificent scenarios devised by Victor Hugo, the gigantic phantasies\\nwhich fought therein amidst a ceaseless cross-fire of antithesis, had\\nat first transported them into the fulness of epic glory; gesticulating,\\nwatching the sun decline behind some ruins, seeing life pass by amidst\\nall the superb but false glitter of a fifth act. Then Musset had come to\\nunman them with his passion and his tears; they heard their own hearts\\nthrob in response to his, a new world opened to them--a world more\\nhuman--that conquered them by its cries for pity, and of eternal misery,\\nwhich henceforth they were to hear rising from all things. Besides,\\nthey were not difficult to please; they showed the voracity of youth,\\na furious appetite for all kinds of literature, good and bad alike. So\\neager were they to admire something, that often the most execrable works\\nthrew them into a state of exaltation similar to that which the purest\\nmasterpieces produce.\\n\\nAnd as Sandoz now remarked, it was their great love of bodily exercise,\\ntheir very revels of literature that had protected them against the\\nnumbing influence of their ordinary surroundings. They never entered a\\ncafe, they had a horror of the streets, even pretending to moult in\\nthem like caged eagles, whereas their schoolfellows were already rubbing\\ntheir elbows over the small marble tables and playing at cards for\\ndrinks. Provincial life, which dragged other lads, when still young,\\nwithin its cogged mechanism, that habit of going to oneâ\\x80\\x99s club, of\\nspelling out the local paper from its heading to the last advertisement,\\nthe everlasting game of dominoes no sooner finished than renewed, the\\nsame walk at the self-same hour and ever along the same roads--all that\\nbrutifies the mind, like a grindstone crushing the brain, filled them\\nwith indignation, called forth their protestations. They preferred to\\nscale the neighbouring hills in search of some unknown solitary spot,\\nwhere they declaimed verses even amidst drenching showers, without\\ndreaming of shelter in their very hatred of town-life. They had even\\nplanned an encampment on the banks of the Viorne, where they were to\\nlive like savages, happy with constant bathing, and the company of five\\nor six books, which would amply suffice for their wants. Even womankind\\nwas to be strictly banished from that camp. Being very timid and awkward\\nin the presence of the gentler sex, they pretended to the asceticism\\nof superior intellects. For two years Claude had been in love with a\\nâ\\x80\\x98prentice hat-trimmer, whom every evening he had followed at a distance,\\nbut to whom he had never dared to address a word. Sandoz nursed dreams\\nof ladies met while travelling, beautiful girls who would suddenly\\nspring up in some unknown wood, charm him for a whole day, and melt into\\nair at dusk. The only love adventure which they had ever met with still\\nevoked their laughter, so silly did it seem to them now. It consisted\\nof a series of serenades which they had given to two young ladies during\\nthe time when they, the serenaders, had formed part of the college band.\\nThey passed their nights beneath a window playing the clarinet and the\\ncornet-a-piston, and thus raising a discordant din which frightened all\\nthe folk of the neighbourhood, until one memorable evening the indignant\\nparents had emptied all the water pitchers of the family over them.\\n\\nAh! those were happy days, and how loving was the laughter with\\nwhich they recalled them. On the walls of the studio hung a series of\\nsketches, which Claude, it so happened, had made during a recent trip\\nsouthward. Thus it seemed as if they were surrounded by the familiar\\nvistas of bright blue sky overhanging a tawny country-side. Here\\nstretched a plain dotted with little greyish olive trees as far as a\\nrosy network of distant hills. There, between sunburnt russet slopes,\\nthe exhausted Viorne was almost running dry beneath the span of an\\nold dust-bepowdered bridge, without a bit of green, nothing save a few\\nbushes, dying for want of moisture. Farther on, the mountain gorge of\\nthe Infernets showed its yawning chasm amidst tumbled rocks, struck down\\nby lightning, a huge chaos, a wild desert, rolling stony billows as far\\nas the eye could reach. Then came all sorts of well remembered nooks:\\nthe valley of Repentance, narrow and shady, a refreshing oasis amid\\ncalcined fields; the wood of Les Trois Bons-Dieux, with hard, green,\\nvarnished pines shedding pitchy tears beneath the burning sun; the sheep\\nwalk of Bouffan, showing white, like a mosque, amidst a far-stretching\\nblood-red plain. And there were yet bits of blinding, sinuous roads;\\nravines, where the heat seemed even to wring bubbling perspiration from\\nthe pebbles; stretches of arid, thirsty sand, drinking up rivers drop\\nby drop; mole hills, goat paths, and hill crests, half lost in the azure\\nsky.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Sandoz, turning towards one sketch, â\\x80\\x98whatâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, indignant, waved his palette. â\\x80\\x98What! donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember? We\\nwere very nigh breaking our necks there. Surely you recollect the day we\\nclambered from the very bottom of Jaumegarde with Dubuche? The rock was\\nas smooth as your hand, and we had to cling to it with our nails, so\\nthat at one moment we could neither get up nor go down again. When we\\nwere once atop and about to cook our cutlets, we, you and I, nearly came\\nto blows.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz now remembered. â\\x80\\x98Yes, yes; each had to roast his own cutlet on\\nrosemary sticks, and, as mine took fire, you exasperated me by chaffing\\nmy cutlet, which was being reduced to cinders.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey both shook with laughter, until the painter resumed his work,\\ngravely concluding, â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all over, old man. There is to be no more\\nidling at present.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe spoke the truth. Since the three inseparables had realised\\ntheir dream of meeting together in Paris, which they were bent upon\\nconquering, their life had been terribly hard. They had tried to renew\\nthe long walks of old. On certain Sunday mornings they had started on\\nfoot from the Fontainebleau gate, had scoured the copses of Verrieres,\\ngone as far as the Bievre, crossed the woods of Meudon and Bellevue,\\nand returned home by way of Grenelle. But they taxed Paris with spoiling\\ntheir legs; they scarcely ever left the pavement now, entirely taken up\\nas they were with their struggle for fortune and fame.\\n\\nFrom Monday morning till Saturday night Sandoz sat fuming and fretting\\nat the municipal building of the fifth Arrondissement in a dark corner\\nof the registry office for births, rooted to his stool by the thought of\\nhis mother, whom his salary of a hundred and fifty francs a month\\nhelped in some fashion to keep. Dubuche, anxious to pay his parents the\\ninterest of the money placed on his head, was ever on the look-out for\\nsome petty jobs among architects, outside his studies at the School of\\nArts. As for Claude, thanks to his thousand francs a year, he had his\\nfull liberty; but the latter days of each month were terrible enough,\\nespecially if he had to share the fag-end of his allowance. Luckily he\\nwas beginning to sell a little; disposing of tiny canvases, at the\\nrate of ten and twelve francs a-piece, to Papa Malgras, a wary picture\\ndealer. After all, he preferred starvation to turning his art into\\nmere commerce by manufacturing portraits of tradesmen and their wives;\\nconcocting conventional religious pictures or daubing blinds for\\nrestaurants or sign-boards for accoucheuses. When first he had\\nreturned to Paris, he had rented a very large studio in the Impasse des\\nBourdonnais; but he had moved to the Quai de Bourbon from motives of\\neconomy. He lived there like a savage, with an absolute contempt for\\neverything that was not painting. He had fallen out with his relatives,\\nwho disgusted him; he had even ceased visiting his aunt, who kept a\\npork-butcherâ\\x80\\x99s shop near the Central Markets, because she looked too\\nflourishing and plump.* Respecting the downfall of his mother, who was\\nbeing eaten out of doors and driven into the streets, he nursed a secret\\ngrief.\\n\\n  * This aunt is Lisa of â\\x80\\x98The Fat and the Thinâ\\x80\\x99 (Le Ventre de Paris)\\n    in a few chapters of which Claude figures.--ED.\\n\\nSuddenly he shouted to Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98Will you be kind enough not to tumble to\\npieces?â\\x80\\x99 But Sandoz declared that he was getting stiff, and jumped\\nfrom the couch to stretch his legs a bit. They took ten minutesâ\\x80\\x99\\nrest, talking meanwhile about many things. Claude felt condescendingly\\ngood-tempered. When his work went smoothly he brightened up and became\\ntalkative; he, who painted with his teeth set, and raged inwardly\\ndirectly he felt that nature was escaping him. Hence his friend had\\nscarcely resumed his attitude before he went on chattering, without,\\nhowever, missing a stroke of his brush.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s going on all right, old boy, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? You look all there in it.\\nOh, the brutes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just see whether theyâ\\x80\\x99ll refuse me this time. I am\\nmore severe for myself than they are for themselves, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of it; and\\nwhenever I pass one of my own pictures, itâ\\x80\\x99s more serious than if it had\\npassed before all the hanging committees on earth. You know my picture\\nof the markets, with the two urchins tumbling about on a heap of\\nvegetables? Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve scratched it all out, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t come right. I\\nfound that I had got hold of a beastly machine,* a deal too heavy for my\\nstrength. But, never you fear, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take the subject up again some day,\\nwhen I know better, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take up others, machines which will knock\\nthem all cock-a-hoop with surprise.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n  * In familiar conversation, French artists, playwrights, and\\n    novelists invariably call their productions by the slang\\n    term â\\x80\\x98machines.â\\x80\\x99--ED.\\n\\nHe made a magnificent gesture, as if to sweep a whole crowd away;\\nemptied a tube of cobalt on his palette; and then began to jeer, asking\\nwhat his first master would say to a picture like this? His first master\\nindeed, Papa Belloque, a retired infantry captain, with one arm, who for\\na quarter of a century had taught drawing to the youth of Plassans\\nin one of the galleries of the Museum! Then, in Paris, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t the\\ncelebrated Berthou, the painter of â\\x80\\x98Nero in the Circusâ\\x80\\x99--Berthou, whose\\nlessons he had attended for six long months--told him a score of times\\nthat he would never be able to do anything? How he now regretted those\\nsix months wasted in idiotic efforts, absurd â\\x80\\x98studies,â\\x80\\x99 under the iron\\nrule of a man whose ideas differed so much from his own. He at last\\nbegan to hold forth against working at the Louvre. He would, he said,\\nsooner chop his hand off than return there to spoil his perception of\\nnature by undertaking one of those copies which for ever dim the vision\\nof the world in which one lives.\\n\\nWas there aught else in art than the rendering of what one felt within\\noneself? Was not the whole of art reduced to placing a woman in front\\nof one--and then portraying her according to the feelings that she\\ninspired? Was not a bunch of carrots--yes, a bunch of carrots--studied\\nfrom nature, and painted unaffectedly, in a personal style, worth all\\nthe ever-lasting smudges of the School of Arts, all that tobacco-juice\\npainting, cooked up according to certain given recipes? The day would\\ncome when one carrot, originally rendered, would lead to a revolution.\\nIt was because of this that he now contented himself with going to the\\nBoutin studio, a free studio, kept by a former model, in the Rue de la\\nHuchette. When he had paid his twenty francs he was put in front of as\\nmany men and women as he cared for, and set about his work with a will,\\nnever thinking of eating or drinking, but struggling unrestingly with\\nnature, mad almost with the excitement of work, by the side of a pack\\nof dandies who accused him of ignorant laziness, and arrogantly prated\\nabout their â\\x80\\x98studies,â\\x80\\x99 because they copied noses and mouths, under the\\neye of a master.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen to this, old man: when one of those whipper-snappers can build\\nup a torso like that one over yonder, he may come up and tell me, and\\nweâ\\x80\\x99ll have a talk together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWith the end of his brush he pointed to a study of the nude, suspended\\nfrom the wall near the door. It was really magnificent, full of masterly\\nbreadth of colouring. By its side were some other admirable bits, a\\ngirlâ\\x80\\x99s feet exquisite in their delicate truthfulness, and a womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntrunk with quivering satin-like skin. In his rare moments of content\\nhe felt proud of those few studies, the only ones which satisfied him,\\nwhich, as it were, foretold a great painter, admirably gifted, but\\nhampered by sudden and inexplicable fits of impotency.\\n\\nDealing sabre-like strokes at the velveteen jacket, he continued lashing\\nhimself into excitement with his uncompromising theories which respected\\nnobody:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They are all so many daubers of penny prints, who have stolen their\\nreputations; a set of idiots or knaves on their knees before public\\nimbecility! Not one among them dares to give the philistines a slap in\\nthe face. And, while we are about it, you know that old Ingres turns me\\nsick with his glairy painting. Nevertheless, heâ\\x80\\x99s a brick, and a plucky\\nfellow, and I take off my hat to him, for he did not care a curse for\\nanybody, and he used to draw like the very devil. He ended by making the\\nidiots, who nowadays believe they understand him, swallow that drawing\\nof his. After him there are only two worth speaking of, Delacroix and\\nCourbet. The others are only numskulls. Oh, that old romantic lion, the\\ncarriage of him! He was a decorator who knew how to make the colours\\nblaze. And what a grasp he had! He would have covered every wall in\\nParis if they had let him; his palette boiled, and boiled over. I know\\nvery well that it was only so much phantasmagoria. Never mind, I like it\\nfor all that, as it was needed to set the School on fire. Then came the\\nother, a stout workman--that one, the truest painter of the century,\\nand altogether classical besides, a fact which not one of the dullards\\nunderstood. They yelled, of course; they shouted about profanation\\nand realism, when, after all, the realism was only in the subject. The\\nperception remained that of the old masters, and the execution\\nresumed and continued the best bits of work one can find in our public\\ngalleries. Both Delacroix and Courbet came at the proper time. Each made\\na stride forward. And now--ah, now!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe ceased speaking and drew back a few steps to judge of the effect of\\nhis picture, becoming absorbed in contemplation for a moment, and then\\nresuming:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, nowadays we want something different--what, I donâ\\x80\\x99t exactly know.\\nIf I did, and could do it, I should be clever indeed. No one else would\\nbe in the race with me. All I do know and feel is that Delacroixâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngrand romantic scenes are foundering and splitting, that Courbetâ\\x80\\x99s black\\npainting already reeks of the mustiness of a studio which the sun never\\npenetrates. You understand me, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? We, perhaps, want the sun, the\\nopen air, a clear, youthful style of painting, men and things such as\\nthey appear in the real light. In short, I myself am unable to say what\\nour painting should be; the painting that our eyes of to-day should\\nexecute and behold.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis voice again fell; he stammered and found himself unable to explain\\nthe formulas of the future that were rising within him. Deep silence\\ncame while he continued working at the velveteen jacket, quivering all\\nthe time.\\n\\nSandoz had been listening to him without stirring from his position. His\\nback was still turned, and he said slowly, as if speaking to the wall in\\na kind of dream:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No; one does not know, and still we ought to know. But each time a\\nprofessor has wanted to impress a truth upon me, I have mistrustfully\\nrevolted, thinking: â\\x80\\x9cHe is either deceiving himself or deceiving me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n Their ideas exasperate me. It seems to me that truth is larger, more\\ngeneral. How beautiful would it be if one could devote the whole of\\noneâ\\x80\\x99s existence to one single work, into which one would endeavour to\\nput everything, the beasts of the field as well as mankind; in short,\\na kind of immense ark. And not in the order indicated by manuals of\\nphilosophy, or according to the idiotic hierarchy on which we pride\\nourselves, but according to the full current of life; a world in which\\nwe should be nothing more than an accident, in which the passing cur,\\neven the stones of the roads, would complete and explain us. In sum, the\\ngrand whole, without low or high, or clean or unclean, such as it indeed\\nis in reality. It is certainly to science that poets and novelists ought\\nto address themselves, for it is the only possible source of inspiration\\nto-day. But what are we to borrow from it? How are we to march in its\\ncompany? The moment I begin to think about that sort of thing I feel\\nthat I am floundering. Ah, if I only knew, what a series of books I\\nwould hurl at the heads of the crowd!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe also became silent. The previous winter he had published his first\\nbook: a series of little sketches, brought from Plassans, among which\\nonly a few rougher notes indicated that the author was a mutineer, a\\npassionate lover of truth and power. And lately he had been feeling his\\nway, questioning himself while all sorts of confused ideas throbbed in\\nhis brain. At first, smitten with the thought of undertaking something\\nherculean, he had planned a genesis of the universe, in three phases or\\nparts; the creation narrated according to science; mankind supervening\\nat the appointed hour and playing its part in the chain of beings and\\nevents; then the future--beings constantly following one another, and\\nfinishing the creation of the world by the endless labour of life. But\\nhe had calmed down in presence of the venturesome hypotheses of this\\nthird phase; and he was now looking out for a more restricted, more\\nhuman framework, in which, however, his vast ambition might find room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, to be able to see and paint everything,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, after a\\nlong interval. â\\x80\\x98To have miles upon miles of walls to cover, to decorate\\nthe railway stations, the markets, the municipal offices, everything\\nthat will be built, when architects are no longer idiots. Only strong\\nheads and strong muscles will be wanted, for there will be no lack of\\nsubjects. Life such as it runs about the streets, the life of the\\nrich and the poor, in the market places, on the race-courses, on the\\nboulevards, in the populous alleys; and every trade being plied, and\\nevery passion portrayed in full daylight, and the peasants, too, and the\\nbeasts of the fields and the landscapes--ah! youâ\\x80\\x99ll see it all, unless I\\nam a downright brute. My very hands are itching to do it. Yes! the whole\\nof modern life! Frescoes as high as the Pantheon! A series of canvases\\nbig enough to burst the Louvre!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhenever they were thrown together the painter and the author generally\\nreached this state of excitement. They spurred each other mutually, they\\nwent mad with dreams of glory; and there was such a burst of youth, such\\na passion for work about their plans, that they themselves often smiled\\nafterwards at those great, proud dreams which seemed to endow them with\\nsuppleness, strength, and spirit.\\n\\nClaude, who had stepped back as far as the wall, remained leaning\\nagainst it, and gazing at his work. Seeing which, Sandoz, overcome by\\nfatigue, left the couch and joined him. Then both looked at the picture\\nwithout saying a word. The gentleman in the velveteen jacket was\\nentirely roughed in. His hand, more advanced than the rest, furnished\\na pretty fresh patch of flesh colour amid the grass, and the dark coat\\nstood out so vigorously that the little silhouettes in the background,\\nthe two little women wrestling in the sunlight, seemed to have retreated\\nfurther into the luminous quivering of the glade. The principal figure,\\nthe recumbent woman, as yet scarcely more than outlined, floated about\\nlike some aerial creature seen in dreams, some eagerly desired Eve\\nspringing from the earth, with her features vaguely smiling and her\\neyelids closed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, now, what are you going to call it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98_The Open Air_,â\\x80\\x99 replied Claude, somewhat curtly.\\n\\nThe title sounded rather technical to the writer, who, in spite of\\nhimself, was sometimes tempted to introduce literature into pictorial\\nart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98_The Open Air_! that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t suggest anything.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There is no occasion for it to suggest anything. Some women and a man\\nare reposing in a forest in the sunlight. Does not that suffice? Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nfret, thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough in it to make a masterpiece.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe threw back his head and muttered between his teeth: â\\x80\\x98Dash it all!\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s very black still. I canâ\\x80\\x99t get Delacroix out of my eye, do what I\\nwill. And then the hand, thatâ\\x80\\x99s Courbetâ\\x80\\x99s manner. Everyone of us dabs\\nhis brush into the romantic sauce now and then. We had too much of it\\nin our youth, we floundered in it up to our very chins. We need a jolly\\ngood wash to get clear of it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of despair. He also\\nbewailed the fact that he had been born at what he called the confluence\\nof Hugo and Balzac. Nevertheless, Claude remained satisfied, full of the\\nhappy excitement of a successful sitting. If his friend could give him\\ntwo or three more Sundays the man in the jacket would be all there. He\\nhad enough of him for the present. Both began to joke, for, as a rule,\\nClaude almost killed his models, only letting them go when they were\\nfainting, half dead with fatigue. He himself now very nigh dropped, his\\nlegs bending under him, and his stomach empty. And as the cuckoo\\nclock struck five, he snatched at his crust of bread and devoured it.\\nThoroughly worn out, he broke it with trembling fingers, and scarcely\\nchewed it, again standing before his picture, pursued by his passion to\\nsuch a degree as to be unconscious even that he was eating.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Five oâ\\x80\\x99clock,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, as he stretched himself, with his arms\\nupraised. â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s go and have dinner. Ah! here comes Dubuche, just in\\ntime.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a knock at the door, and Dubuche came in. He was a stout young\\nfellow, dark, with regular but heavy features, close-cropped hair, and\\nmoustaches already full-blown. He shook hands with both his friends,\\nand stopped before the picture, looking nonplussed. In reality that\\nharum-scarum style of painting upset him, such was the even balance of\\nhis nature, such his reverence as a steady student for the established\\nformulas of art; and it was only his feeling of friendship which, as\\na rule, prevented him from criticising. But this time his whole being\\nrevolted visibly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter? Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it suit you?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz, who was\\nwatching him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, oh yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s very well painted--but--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, spit it out. What is it that ruffles you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not much, only the gentleman is fully dressed, and the women are not.\\nPeople have never seen anything like that before.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis sufficed to make both the others wild. Why, were there not a\\nhundred pictures in the Louvre composed in precisely the same way?\\nHadnâ\\x80\\x99t all Paris and all the painters and tourists of the world seen\\nthem? And besides, if people had never seen anything like it, they would\\nsee it now. After all, they didnâ\\x80\\x99t care a fig for the public!\\n\\nNot in the least disconcerted by these violent replies, Dubuche\\nrepeated quietly: â\\x80\\x98The public wonâ\\x80\\x99t understand--the public will think it\\nindecorous--and so it is!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You wretched bourgeois philistine!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, exasperated.\\nâ\\x80\\x98They are making a famous idiot of you at the School of Arts. You\\nwerenâ\\x80\\x99t such a fool formerly.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThese were the current amenities of his two friends since Dubuche had\\nattended the School of Arts. He thereupon beat a retreat, rather afraid\\nof the turn the dispute was taking, and saved himself by belabouring the\\npainters of the School. Certainly his friends were right in one respect,\\nthe School painters were real idiots. But as for the architects, that\\nwas a different matter. Where was he to get his tuition, if not there?\\nBesides his tuition would not prevent him from having ideas of his own,\\nlater on. Wherewith he assumed a very revolutionary air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98the moment you apologise, letâ\\x80\\x99s go and dine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Claude had mechanically taken up a brush and set to work again.\\nBeside the gentleman in the velveteen jacket the figure of the recumbent\\nwoman seemed to be fading away. Feverish and impatient, he traced a bold\\noutline round her so as to bring her forward.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you coming?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98In a minute; hang it, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the hurry? Just let me set this right, and\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll be with you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz shook his head and then remarked very quietly, lest he should\\nstill further annoy him: â\\x80\\x98You do wrong to worry yourself like that, old\\nman. Yes, you are knocked up, and have had nothing to eat, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nonly spoil your work, as you did the other day.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut the painter waved him off with a peevish gesture. It was the old\\nstory--he did not know when to leave off; he intoxicated himself with\\nwork in his craving for an immediate result, in order to prove to\\nhimself that he held his masterpiece at last. Doubts had just driven him\\nto despair in the midst of his delight at having terminated a successful\\nsitting. Had he done right, after all, in making the velveteen jacket\\nso prominent, and would he not afterwards fail to secure the brilliancy\\nwhich he wished the female figure to show? Rather than remain in\\nsuspense he would have dropped down dead on the spot. Feverishly drawing\\nthe sketch of Christineâ\\x80\\x99s head from the portfolio where he had hidden\\nit, he compared it with the painting on the canvas, assisting himself,\\nas it were, by means of this document derived from life.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Dubuche, â\\x80\\x98where did you get that from? Who is it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, startled by the questions, did not answer; then, without\\nreflecting, he who usually told them everything, brusquely lied,\\nprompted by a delicate impulse to keep silent respecting the adventure\\nof the night.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Tell us who it is?â\\x80\\x99 repeated the architect.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nobody at all--a model.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A model! a very young one, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she? She looks very nice. I wish you\\nwould give me her address. Not for myself, but for a sculptor I know\\nwhoâ\\x80\\x99s on the look-out for a Psyche. Have you got the address there?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon Dubuche turned to a corner of the greyish wall on which the\\naddresses of several models were written in chalk, haphazard. The\\nwomen particularly left their cards in that way, in awkward, childish\\nhandwriting. Zoe Piedefer, 7 Rue Campagne-Premiere, a big brunette, who\\nwas getting rather too stout, had scrawled her sign manual right across\\nthe names of little Flore Beauchamp, 32 Rue de Laval, and Judith Vaquez,\\n69 Rue du Rocher, a Jewess, both of whom were too thin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, have you got the address?â\\x80\\x99 resumed Dubuche.\\n\\nThen Claude flew into a passion. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t pester me! I donâ\\x80\\x99t know and\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t care. Youâ\\x80\\x99re a nuisance, worrying like that just when a fellow\\nwants to work.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz had not said a word. Surprised at first, he had soon smiled. He\\nwas gifted with more penetration than Dubuche, so he gave him a knowing\\nnod, and they then began to chaff. They begged Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s pardon; the\\nmoment he wanted to keep the young person for his personal use, they\\nwould not ask him to lend her. Ha! ha! the scamp went hunting about for\\npretty models. And where had he picked up that one?\\n\\nMore and more embarrassed by these remarks, Claude went on fidgetting.\\nâ\\x80\\x98What a couple of idiots you are!â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98If you only knew what\\nfools you are making of yourselves. Thatâ\\x80\\x99ll do. You really make me sorry\\nfor both of you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis voice sounded so stern that they both became silent immediately,\\nwhile he, after once more scratching out the womanâ\\x80\\x99s head, drew it anew\\nand began to paint it in, following his sketch of Christine, but with a\\nfeverish, unsteady touch which went at random.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just give me another ten minutes, will you?â\\x80\\x99 he repeated. â\\x80\\x98I will rough\\nin the shoulders to be ready for to-morrow, and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll go down.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz and Dubuche, knowing that it was of no use to prevent him from\\nkilling himself in this fashion, resigned themselves to the inevitable.\\nThe latter lighted his pipe, and flung himself on the couch. He was the\\nonly one of the three who smoked; the others had never taken kindly to\\ntobacco, always feeling qualmish after a cigar. And when Dubuche was\\nstretched on his back, his eyes turned towards the clouds of smoke he\\nraised, he began to talk about himself in an interminable monotonous\\nfashion. Ah! that confounded Paris, how one had to work oneâ\\x80\\x99s fingers\\nto the bone in order to get on. He recalled the fifteen months\\nof apprenticeship he had spent with his master, the celebrated\\nDequersonniere, a former grand-prize man, now architect of the Civil\\nBranch of Public Works, an officer of the Legion of Honour and a member\\nof the Institute, whose chief architectural performance, the church of\\nSt. Mathieu, was a cross between a pastry-cookâ\\x80\\x99s mould and a clock in\\nthe so-called First Empire style. A good sort of fellow, after all, was\\nthis Dequersonniere whom Dubuche chaffed, while inwardly sharing\\nhis reverence for the old classical formulas. However, but for his\\nfellow-pupils, the young man would not have learnt much at the studio in\\nthe Rue du Four, for the master only paid a running visit to the place\\nsome three times a week. A set of ferocious brutes, were those comrades\\nof his, who had made his life jolly hard in the beginning, but who, at\\nleast, had taught him how to prepare a surface, outline, and wash in\\na plan. And how often had he had to content himself with a cup of\\nchocolate and a roll for dejeuner in order to pay the necessary\\nfive-and-twenty francs to the superintendent! And the sheets of paper he\\nhad laboriously smudged, and the hours he had spent in poring over\\nbooks before he had dared to present himself at the School! And he had\\nnarrowly escaped being plucked in spite of all his assiduous endeavours.\\nHe lacked imagination, and the drawings he submitted, a caryatide and\\na summer dining-room, both extremely mediocre performances, had classed\\nhim at the bottom of the list. Fortunately, he had made up for this\\nin his oral examination with his logarithms, geometry, and history of\\narchitecture, for he was very strong in the scientific parts. Now that\\nhe was attending the School as a second-class student, he had to toil\\nand moil in order to secure a first-class diploma. It was a dogâ\\x80\\x99s life,\\nthere was no end to it, said he.\\n\\nHe stretched his legs apart, high upon the cushions, and smoked\\nvigorously and regularly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What with their courses of perspective, of descriptive geometry, of\\nstereotomy, of building, and of the history of art--ah! upon my word,\\nthey do make one blacken paper with notes. And every month there is a\\ncompetitive examination in architecture, sometimes a simple sketch,\\nat others a complete design. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no time for pleasure if a fellow\\nwishes to pass his examinations and secure the necessary honourable\\nmentions, especially if, besides all that, he has to find time to earn\\nhis bread. As for myself, itâ\\x80\\x99s almost killing me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOne of the cushions having slipped upon the floor, he fished it up with\\nhis feet. â\\x80\\x98All the same, Iâ\\x80\\x99m lucky. There are so many of us scouring\\nthe town every day without getting the smallest job. The day before\\nyesterday I discovered an architect who works for a large contractor.\\nYou can have no idea of such an ignoramus of an architect--a downright\\nnumskull, incapable even of tracing a plan. He gives me twenty-five sous\\nan hour, and I set his houses straight for him. It came just in time,\\ntoo, for my mother sent me word that she was quite cleared out. Poor\\nmother, what a lot of money I have to refund her!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs Dubuche was evidently talking to himself, chewing the cud of\\nhis everyday thoughts--his constant thoughts of making a rapid\\nfortune--Sandoz did not even trouble to listen to him. He had opened the\\nlittle window, and seated himself on a level with the roof, for he felt\\noppressed by the heat in the studio. But all at once he interrupted the\\narchitect.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, are you coming to dinner on Thursday? All the other fellows will\\nbe there--Fagerolles, Mahoudeau, Jory, Gagniere.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nEvery Thursday, quite a band met at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s: friends from Plassans and\\nothers met in Paris--revolutionaries to a man, and all animated by the\\nsame passionate love of art.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Next Thursday? No, I think not,â\\x80\\x99 answered Dubuche.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am obliged to go to a dance at a familyâ\\x80\\x99s I know.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where you expect to get hold of a dowry, I suppose?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be such a bad spec.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe shook the ashes from his pipe on to his left palm, and then,\\nsuddenly raising his voice--â\\x80\\x98I almost forgot. I have had a letter from\\nPouillaud.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You, too!--well, I think heâ\\x80\\x99s pretty well done for, Pouillaud. Another\\ngood fellow gone wrong.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why gone wrong? Heâ\\x80\\x99ll succeed his father; heâ\\x80\\x99ll spend his money quietly\\ndown there. He writes rationally enough. I always said heâ\\x80\\x99d show us a\\nthing or two, in spite of all his practical jokes. Ah! that beast of a\\nPouillaud.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz, furious, was about to reply, when a despairing oath from\\nClaude stopped him. The latter had not opened his lips since he had\\nso obstinately resumed his work. To all appearance he had not even\\nlistened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Curse it--I have failed again. Decidedly, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a brute, I shall never do\\nanything.â\\x80\\x99 And in a fit of mad rage he wanted to rush at his picture and\\ndash his fist through it. His friends had to hold him back. Why, it was\\nsimply childish to get into such a passion. Would matters be improved\\nwhen, to his mortal regret, he had destroyed his work? Still shaking,\\nhe relapsed into silence, and stared at the canvas with an ardent fixed\\ngaze that blazed with all the horrible agony born of his powerlessness.\\nHe could no longer produce anything clear or life-like; the womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbreast was growing pasty with heavy colouring; that flesh which, in his\\nfancy, ought to have glowed, was simply becoming grimy; he could not\\neven succeed in getting a correct focus. What on earth was the matter\\nwith his brain that he heard it bursting asunder, as it were, amidst his\\nvain efforts? Was he losing his sight that he was no longer able to see\\ncorrectly? Were his hands no longer his own that they refused to obey\\nhim? And thus he went on winding himself up, irritated by the strange\\nhereditary lesion which sometimes so greatly assisted his creative\\npowers, but at others reduced him to a state of sterile despair, such as\\nto make him forget the first elements of drawing. Ah, to feel giddy with\\nvertiginous nausea, and yet to remain there full of a furious passion\\nto create, when the power to do so fled with everything else, when\\neverything seemed to founder around him--the pride of work, the\\ndreamt-of glory, the whole of his existence!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look here, old boy,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz at last, â\\x80\\x98we donâ\\x80\\x99t want to worry you,\\nbut itâ\\x80\\x99s half-past six, and we are starving. Be reasonable, and come\\ndown with us.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was cleaning a corner of his palette. Then he emptied some more\\ntubes on it, and, in a voice like thunder, replied with one single word,\\nâ\\x80\\x98No.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor the next ten minutes nobody spoke; the painter, beside himself,\\nwrestled with his picture, whilst his friends remained anxious at this\\nattack, which they did not know how to allay. Then, as there came a\\nknock at the door, the architect went to open it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, itâ\\x80\\x99s Papa Malgras.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMalgras, the picture-dealer, was a thick-set individual, with\\nclose-cropped, brush-like, white hair, and a red splotchy face. He\\nwas wrapped in a very dirty old green coat, that made him look like an\\nuntidy cabman. In a husky voice, he exclaimed: â\\x80\\x98I happened to pass along\\nthe quay, on the other side of the way, and I saw that gentleman at the\\nwindow. So I came up.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaudeâ\\x80\\x99s continued silence made him pause. The painter had turned to his\\npicture again with an impatient gesture. Not that this silence in any\\nway embarrassed the new comer, who, standing erect on his sturdy legs\\nand feeling quite at home, carefully examined the new picture with his\\nbloodshot eyes. Without any ceremony, he passed judgment upon it in one\\nphrase--half ironic, half affectionate: â\\x80\\x98Well, well, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a machine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, seeing that nobody said anything, he began to stroll round the\\nstudio, looking at the paintings on the walls.\\n\\nPapa Malgras, beneath his thick layer of grease and grime, was really\\na very cute customer, with taste and scent for good painting. He never\\nwasted his time or lost his way among mere daubers; he went straight, as\\nif from instinct, to individualists, whose talent was contested still,\\nbut whose future fame his flaming, drunkardâ\\x80\\x99s nose sniffed from afar.\\nAdded to this he was a ferocious hand at bargaining, and displayed\\nall the cunning of a savage in his efforts to secure, for a song, the\\npictures that he coveted. True, he himself was satisfied with very\\nhonest profits, twenty per cent., thirty at the most. He based his\\ncalculations on quickly turning over his small capital, never purchasing\\nin the morning without knowing where to dispose of his purchase at\\nnight. As a superb liar, moreover, he had no equal.\\n\\nPausing near the door, before the studies from the nude, painted at the\\nBoutin studio, he contemplated them in silence for a few moments, his\\neyes glistening the while with the enjoyment of a connoisseur, which his\\nheavy eyelids tried to hide. Assuredly, he thought, there was a great\\ndeal of talent and sentiment of life about that big crazy fellow Claude,\\nwho wasted his time in painting huge stretches of canvas which no one\\nwould buy. The girlâ\\x80\\x99s pretty legs, the admirably painted womanâ\\x80\\x99s trunk,\\nfilled the dealer with delight. But there was no sale for that kind of\\nstuff, and he had already made his choice--a tiny sketch, a nook of the\\ncountry round Plassans, at once delicate and violent--which he pretended\\nnot to notice. At last he drew near, and said, in an off-hand way:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s this? Ah! yes, I know, one of the things you brought back with\\nyou from the South. Itâ\\x80\\x99s too crude. I still have the two I bought of\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he went on in mellow, long-winded phrases. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll perhaps not\\nbelieve me, Monsieur Lantier, but that sort of thing doesnâ\\x80\\x99t sell at\\nall--not at all. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a set of rooms full of them. Iâ\\x80\\x99m always afraid of\\nsmashing something when I turn round. I canâ\\x80\\x99t go on like that, honour\\nbright; I shall have to go into liquidation, and I shall end my days in\\nthe hospital. You know me, eh? my heart is bigger than my pocket, and\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing I like better than to oblige young men of talent like\\nyourself. Oh, for the matter of that, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got talent, and I keep on\\ntelling them so--nay, shouting it to them--but whatâ\\x80\\x99s the good? They\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t nibble, they wonâ\\x80\\x99t nibble!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was trying the emotional dodge; then, with the spirit of a man about\\nto do something rash: â\\x80\\x98Well, it shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t be said that I came in to waste\\nyour time. What do you want for that rough sketch?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, still irritated, was painting nervously. He dryly answered,\\nwithout even turning his head: â\\x80\\x98Twenty francs.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Nonsense; twenty francs! you must be mad. You sold me the others\\nten francs a-piece--and to-day I wonâ\\x80\\x99t give a copper more than eight\\nfrancs.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs a rule the painter closed with him at once, ashamed and humbled at\\nthis miserable chaffering, glad also to get a little money now and\\nthen. But this time he was obstinate, and took to insulting the\\npicture-dealer, who, giving tit for tat, all at once dropped the formal\\nâ\\x80\\x98youâ\\x80\\x99 to assume the glib â\\x80\\x98thou,â\\x80\\x99 denied his talent, overwhelmed him with\\ninvective, and taxed him with ingratitude. Meanwhile, however, he had\\ntaken from his pocket three successive five-franc pieces, which, as\\nif playing at chuck-farthing, he flung from a distance upon the table,\\nwhere they rattled among the crockery.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98One, two, three--not one more, dost hear? for there is already one too\\nmany, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take care to get it back; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll deduct it from something\\nelse of thine, as I live. Fifteen francs for that! Thou art wrong, my\\nlad, and thouâ\\x80\\x99lt be sorry for this dirty trick.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nQuite exhausted, Claude let him take down the little canvas, which\\ndisappeared as if by magic in his capacious green coat. Had it dropped\\ninto a special pocket, or was it reposing on Papa Malgrasâ\\x80\\x99 ample chest?\\nNot the slightest protuberance indicated its whereabouts.\\n\\nHaving accomplished his stroke of business, Papa Malgras abruptly calmed\\ndown and went towards the door. But he suddenly changed his mind and\\ncame back. â\\x80\\x98Just listen, Lantier,â\\x80\\x99 he said, in the honeyest of tones; â\\x80\\x98I\\nwant a lobster painted. You really owe me that much after fleecing me.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll bring you the lobster, youâ\\x80\\x99ll paint me a bit of still life from\\nit, and keep it for your pains. You can eat it with your friends. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsettled, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this proposal Sandoz and Dubuche, who had hitherto listened\\ninquisitively, burst into such loud laughter that the picture-dealer\\nhimself became gay. Those confounded painters, they did themselves no\\ngood, they simply starved. What would have become of the lazy beggars if\\nhe, Papa Malgras, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t brought a leg of mutton now and then, or a nice\\nfresh plaice, or a lobster, with its garnish of parsley?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll paint me my lobster, eh, Lantier? Much obliged.â\\x80\\x99 And he\\nstationed himself anew before the large canvas, with his wonted smile\\nof mingled derision and admiration. And at last he went off, repeating,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, well, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a machine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude wanted to take up his palette and brushes once more. But his legs\\nrefused their service; his arms fell to his side, stiff, as if pinioned\\nthere by some occult force. In the intense melancholy silence that had\\nfollowed the din of the dispute he staggered, distracted, bereft of\\nsight before his shapeless work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m done for, Iâ\\x80\\x99m done for,â\\x80\\x99 he gasped. â\\x80\\x98That brute has finished me\\noff!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe clock had just struck seven; he had been at work for eight mortal\\nhours without tasting anything but a crust of bread, without taking a\\nmomentâ\\x80\\x99s rest, ever on his legs, shaken by feverish excitement. And now\\nthe sun was setting, shadows began to darken the studio, which in the\\ngloaming assumed a most melancholy aspect. When the light went down like\\nthis on the crisis of a bad dayâ\\x80\\x99s work, it seemed to Claude as if the\\nsun would never rise again, but had for ever carried life and all the\\njubilant gaiety of colour away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come,â\\x80\\x99 implored Sandoz, with all the gentleness of brotherly\\ncompassion. â\\x80\\x98Come, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good fellow.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nEven Dubuche added, â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see more clearly into it to-morrow. Come and\\ndine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor a moment Claude refused to surrender. He stood rooted to the spot,\\ndeaf to their friendly voices, and fiercely obstinate.\\n\\nWhat did he want to do then, since his tired fingers were no longer able\\nto grasp the brush? He did not know, but, however powerless he might be,\\nhe was gnawed by a mad craving to go on working still and to create\\nin spite of everything. Even if he did nothing, he would at least stay\\nthere, he would not vacate the spot. All at once, however, he made up\\nhis mind, shaken the while as by a big sob. He clutched firmly hold\\nof his broadest palette-knife, and, with one deep, slow sweep, he\\nobliterated the womanâ\\x80\\x99s head and bosom. It was veritable murder, a\\npounding away of human flesh; the whole disappeared in a murky, muddy\\nmash. By the side of the gentleman in the dark jacket, amidst the\\nbright verdure, where the two little wrestlers so lightly tinted were\\ndisporting themselves, there remained naught of the nude, headless,\\nbreastless woman but a mutilated trunk, a vague cadaverous stump, an\\nindistinct, lifeless patch of visionary flesh.\\n\\nSandoz and Dubuche were already descending the stairs with a great\\nclatter, and Claude followed them, fleeing his work, in agony at having\\nto leave it thus scarred with a gaping gash.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\nTHE beginning of the week proved disastrous to Claude. He had relapsed\\ninto one of those periods of self-doubt that made him hate painting,\\nwith the hatred of a lover betrayed, who overwhelms the faithless one\\nwith insults although tortured by an uncontrollable desire to worship\\nher yet again. So on the Thursday, after three frightful days of\\nfruitless and solitary battling, he left home as early as eight in\\nthe morning, banging his door violently, and feeling so disgusted with\\nhimself that he swore he would never take up a brush again. When he was\\nunhinged by one of these attacks there was but one remedy, he had to\\nforget himself, and, to do so, it was needful that he should look up\\nsome comrades with whom to quarrel, and, above all, walk about and\\ntrudge across Paris, until the heat and odour of battle rising from her\\npaving-stones put heart into him again.\\n\\nThat day, like every other Thursday, he was to dine at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s, in\\ncompany with their friends. But what was he to do until the evening? The\\nidea of remaining by himself, of eating his heart out, disgusted him.\\nHe would have gone straight to his friend, only he knew that the latter\\nmust be at his office. Then the thought of Dubuche occurred to him, but\\nhe hesitated, for their old friendship had lately been cooling down.\\nHe felt that the fraternity of the earlier times of effort no longer\\nexisted between them. He guessed that Dubuche lacked intelligence, had\\nbecome covertly hostile, and was occupied with ambitions different from\\nhis own. However, he, Claude, must go somewhere. So he made up his mind,\\nand repaired to the Rue Jacob, where the architect rented a small room\\non the sixth floor of a big frigid-looking house.\\n\\nClaude was already on the landing of the second floor, when the\\ndoorkeeper, calling him back, snappishly told him that M. Dubuche was\\nnot at home, and had, in fact, stayed out all night. The young man\\nslowly descended the stairs and found himself in the street, stupefied,\\nas it were, by so prodigious an event as an escapade on the part of\\nDubuche. It was a piece of inconceivable bad luck. For a moment he\\nstrolled along aimlessly; but, as he paused at the corner of the Rue\\nde Seine, not knowing which way to go, he suddenly recollected what his\\nfriend had told him about a certain night spent at the Dequersonniere\\nstudio--a night of terrible hard work, the eve of the day on which the\\npupilsâ\\x80\\x99 designs had to be deposited at the School of Arts. At once he\\nwalked towards the Rue du Four, where the studio was situated. Hitherto\\nhe had carefully abstained from calling there for Dubuche, from fear of\\nthe yells with which outsiders were greeted. But now he made straight\\nfor the place without flinching, his timidity disappearing so thoroughly\\nbefore the anguish of loneliness that he felt ready to undergo any\\namount of insult could he but secure a companion in misfortune.\\n\\nThe studio was situated in the narrowest part of the Rue du Four, at\\nthe far end of a decrepit, tumble-down building. Claude had to cross two\\nevil-smelling courtyards to reach a third, across which ran a sort of\\nbig closed shed, a huge out-house of board and plaster work, which had\\nonce served as a packing-case makerâ\\x80\\x99s workshop. From outside, through\\nthe four large windows, whose panes were daubed with a coating of white\\nlead, nothing could be seen but the bare whitewashed ceiling.\\n\\nHaving pushed the door open, Claude remained motionless on the\\nthreshold. The place stretched out before him, with its four long tables\\nranged lengthwise to the windows--broad double tables they were, which\\nhad swarms of students on either side, and were littered with moist\\nsponges, paint saucers, iron candlesticks, water bowls, and wooden\\nboxes, in which each pupil kept his white linen blouse, his compasses,\\nand colours. In one corner, the stove, neglected since the previous\\nwinter, stood rusting by the side of a pile of coke that had not been\\nswept away; while at the other end a large iron cistern with a tap was\\nsuspended between two towels. And amidst the bare untidiness of this\\nshed, the eye was especially attracted by the walls which, above,\\ndisplayed a litter of plaster casts ranged in haphazard fashion on\\nshelves, and disappeared lower down behind forests of T-squares and\\nbevels, and piles of drawing boards, tied together with webbing straps.\\nBit by bit, such parts of the partitions as had remained unoccupied\\nhad become covered with inscriptions and drawings, a constantly rising\\nflotsam and jetsam of scrawls traced there as on the margin of an\\never-open book. There were caricatures of the students themselves,\\ncoarse witticisms fit to make a gendarme turn pale, epigrammatic\\nsentences, addition sums, addresses, and so forth; while, above all\\nelse, written in big letters, and occupying the most prominent place,\\nappeared this inscription: â\\x80\\x98On the 7th of June, Gorfu declared that he\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t care a hang for Rome.--Signed, Godemard.â\\x80\\x99*\\n\\n  * The allusion is to the French Art School at Rome, and the\\n    competitions into which students enter to obtain admission\\n    to it, or to secure the prizes offered for the best exhibits\\n    which, during their term of residence, they send to Paris.--ED.\\n\\nClaude was greeted with a growl like that of wild beasts disturbed in\\ntheir lair. What kept him motionless was the strange aspect of this\\nplace on the morning of the â\\x80\\x98truck night,â\\x80\\x99 as the embryo architects\\ntermed the crucial night of labour. Since the previous evening, the\\nwhole studio, some sixty pupils, had been shut up there; those who had\\nno designs to exhibit--â\\x80\\x98the niggers,â\\x80\\x99 as they were called remaining to\\nhelp the others, the competitors who, being behind time, had to knock\\noff the work of a week in a dozen hours. Already, at midnight, they had\\nstuffed themselves with brawn, saveloys, and similar viands, washed down\\nwith cheap wine. Towards one oâ\\x80\\x99clock they had secured the company of\\nsome â\\x80\\x98ladiesâ\\x80\\x99; and, without the work abating, the feast had turned into\\na Roman orgy, blended with a smoking competition. On the damp, stained\\nfloor there remained a great litter of greasy paper and broken bottles;\\nwhile the atmosphere reeked of burnt tallow, musk, highly seasoned\\nsausages, and cheap bluish wine.\\n\\nAnd now many voices savagely yelled: â\\x80\\x98Turn him out. Oh, that mug! What\\ndoes he want, that guy? Turn him out, turn him out.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor a moment Claude, quite dazed, staggered beneath the violence of the\\nonslaught. But the epithets became viler, for the acme of elegance,\\neven for the more refined among these young fellows, was to rival\\noneâ\\x80\\x99s friends in beastly language. He was, nevertheless, recovering\\nand beginning to answer, when Dubuche recognised him. The latter turned\\ncrimson, for he detested that kind of adventure. He felt ashamed of\\nhis friend, and rushed towards him, amidst the jeers, which were now\\nlevelled at himself:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, is it you?â\\x80\\x99 he gasped. â\\x80\\x98I told you never to come in. Just wait\\nfor me a minute in the yard.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt that moment, Claude, who was stepping back, narrowly escaped being\\nknocked down by a little hand-truck which two big full-bearded fellows\\nbrought up at a gallop. It was from this truck that the night of heavy\\ntoil derived its name: and for the last week the students who had got\\nbehindhand with their work, through taking up petty paid jobs outside,\\nhad been repeating the cry, â\\x80\\x98Oh! Iâ\\x80\\x99m in the truck and no mistake.â\\x80\\x99 The\\nmoment the vehicle appeared, a clamour arose. It was a quarter to nine\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock, there was barely time to reach the School of Arts. However,\\na helter-skelter rush emptied the studio; each brought out his chases,\\namidst a general jostling; those who obstinately wished to give their\\ndesigns a last finishing touch were knocked about and carried away with\\ntheir comrades. In less than five minutes every frame was piled upon\\nthe truck, and the two bearded fellows, the most recent additions to the\\nstudio, harnessed themselves to it like cattle and drew it along with\\nall their strength, the others vociferating, and pushing from behind. It\\nwas like the rush of a sluice; the three courtyards were crossed amidst\\na torrential crash, and the street was invaded, flooded by the howling\\nthrong.\\n\\nClaude, nevertheless, had set up running by the side of Dubuche, who\\ncame at the fag-end, very vexed at not having had another quarter of an\\nhour to finish a tinted drawing more carefully.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What are you going to do afterwards?â\\x80\\x99 asked Claude.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve errands which will take up my whole day.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter was grieved to see that even this friend escaped him. â\\x80\\x98All\\nright, then,â\\x80\\x99 said he; â\\x80\\x98in that case I leave you. Shall we see you at\\nSandozâ\\x80\\x99s to-night?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, I think so; unless Iâ\\x80\\x99m kept to dinner elsewhere.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBoth were getting out of breath. The band of embryo architects, without\\nslackening their pace, had purposely taken the longest way round for the\\npleasure of prolonging their uproar. After rushing down the Rue du Four,\\nthey dashed across the Place Gozlin and swept into the Rue de lâ\\x80\\x99Echaude.\\nHeading the procession was the truck, drawn and pushed along more and\\nmore vigorously, and constantly rebounding over the rough paving-stones,\\namid the jolting of the frames with which it was laden. Its escort\\ngalloped along madly, compelling the passers-by to draw back close to\\nthe houses in order to save themselves from being knocked down; while\\nthe shop-keepers, standing open-mouthed on their doorsteps, believed\\nin a revolution. The whole neighbourhood seemed topsy-turvy. In the\\nRue Jacob, such was the rush, so frightful were the yells, that several\\nhouse shutters were hastily closed. As the Rue Bonaparte was, at last,\\nbeing reached, one tall, fair fellow thought it a good joke to catch\\nhold of a little servant girl who stood bewildered on the pavement, and\\ndrag her along with them, like a wisp of straw caught in a torrent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, â\\x80\\x98good-bye, then; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you to-night.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, to-night.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter, out of breath, had stopped at the corner of the Rue des\\nBeaux Arts. The court gates of the Art School stood wide open in front\\nof him, and the procession plunged into the yard.\\n\\nAfter drawing breath, Claude retraced his steps to the Rue de Seine. His\\nbad luck was increasing; it seemed ordained that he should not be able\\nto beguile a chum from work that morning. So he went up the street, and\\nslowly walked on as far as the Place du Pantheon, without any definite\\naim. Then it occurred to him that he might just look into the Municipal\\nOffices, if only to shake hands with Sandoz. That would, at any rate,\\nmean ten minutes well spent. But he positively gasped when he was told\\nby an attendant that M. Sandoz had asked for a day off to attend a\\nfuneral. However, he knew the trick of old. His friend always found the\\nsame pretext whenever he wanted to do a good dayâ\\x80\\x99s work at home. He had\\nalready made up his mind to join him there, when a feeling of artistic\\nbrotherliness, the scruple of an honest worker, made him pause; yes, it\\nwould be a crime to go and disturb that good fellow, and infect him with\\nthe discouragement born of a difficult task, at the very moment when he\\nwas, no doubt, manfully accomplishing his own work.\\n\\nSo Claude had to resign himself to his fate. He dragged his black\\nmelancholy along the quays until mid-day, his head so heavy, so full\\nof thoughts of his lack of power, that he only espied the well-loved\\nhorizons of the Seine through a mist. Then he found himself once more\\nin the Rue de la Femme-sans-Tete, where he breakfasted at Gomardâ\\x80\\x99s wine\\nshop, whose sign â\\x80\\x98The Dog of Montargis,â\\x80\\x99 inspired him with interest.\\nSome stonemasons, in their working blouses, bespattered with mortar,\\nwere there at table, and, like them, and with them, he ate his eight\\nsousâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98ordinaryâ\\x80\\x99--some beef broth in a bowl, in which he soaked some\\nbread, followed by a slice of boiled soup-beef, garnished with haricot\\nbeans, and served up on a plate damp with dish-water. However, it\\nwas still too good, he thought, for a brute unable to earn his bread.\\nWhenever his work miscarried, he undervalued himself, ranked himself\\nlower than a common labourer, whose sinewy arms could at least perform\\ntheir appointed task. For an hour he lingered in the tavern brutifying\\nhimself by listening to the conversation at the tables around him. Once\\noutside he slowly resumed his walk in haphazard fashion.\\n\\nWhen he got to the Place de lâ\\x80\\x99Hotel de Ville, however, a fresh idea made\\nhim quicken his pace. Why had he not thought of Fagerolles? Fagerolles\\nwas a nice fellow, gay, and by no means a fool, although he studied at\\nthe School of Arts. One could talk with him, even when he defended\\nbad painting. If he had lunched at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s, in the Rue\\nVieille-du-Temple, he must certainly still be there.\\n\\nOn entering the narrow street, Claude felt a sensation of refreshing\\ncoolness come over him. In the sun it had grown very warm, and moisture\\nrose from the pavement, which, however bright the sky, remained damp and\\ngreasy beneath the constant tramping of the pedestrians. Every minute,\\nwhen a push obliged Claude to leave the footwalk, he found himself in\\ndanger of being knocked down by trucks or vans. Still the street amused\\nhim, with its straggling houses out of line, their flat frontages\\nchequered with signboards up to the very eaves, and pierced with small\\nwindows, whence came the hum of every kind of handiwork that can be\\ncarried on at home. In one of the narrowest parts of the street a small\\nnewspaper shop made him stop. It was betwixt a hairdresserâ\\x80\\x99s and a\\ntripesellerâ\\x80\\x99s, and had an outdoor display of idiotic prints, romantic\\nbalderdash mixed with filthy caricatures fit for a barrack-room. In\\nfront of these â\\x80\\x98pictures,â\\x80\\x99 a lank hobbledehoy stood lost in reverie,\\nwhile two young girls nudged each other and jeered. He felt inclined to\\nslap their faces, but he hurried across the road, for Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 house\\nhappened to be opposite. It was a dark old tenement, standing forward\\nfrom the others, and was bespattered like them with the mud from the\\ngutters. As an omnibus came up, Claude barely had time to jump upon the\\nfoot pavement, there reduced to the proportions of a simple ledge; the\\nwheels brushed against his chest, and he was drenched to his knees.\\n\\nM. Fagerolles, senior, a manufacturer of artistic zinc-work, had his\\nworkshops on the ground floor of the building, and having converted two\\nlarge front rooms on the first floor into a warehouse, he personally\\noccupied a small, dark, cellar-like apartment overlooking the courtyard.\\nIt was there that his son Henri had grown up, like a true specimen of\\nthe flora of the Paris streets, at the edge of that narrow pavement\\nconstantly struck by the omnibus wheels, always soddened by the gutter\\nwater, and opposite the print and newspaper shop, flanked by the\\nbarberâ\\x80\\x99s and tripesellerâ\\x80\\x99s. At first his father had made an ornamental\\ndraughtsman of him for personal use. But when the lad had developed\\nhigher ambition, taking to painting proper, and talking about the School\\nof Arts, there had been quarrels, blows, a series of separations and\\nreconciliations. Even now, although Henri had already achieved some\\nsuccesses, the manufacturer of artistic zinc-work, while letting him\\nhave his will, treated him harshly, like a lad who was spoiling his\\ncareer.\\n\\nAfter shaking off the water, Claude went up the deep archway entrance,\\nto a courtyard, where the light was quite greenish, and where there was\\na dank, musty smell, like that at the bottom of a tank. There was an\\noverhanging roofing of glass and iron at the foot of the staircase,\\nwhich was a wide one, with a wrought-iron railing, eaten with rust. As\\nthe painter passed the warehouse on the first floor, he glanced through\\na glass door and noticed M. Fagerolles examining some patterns. Wishing\\nto be polite, he entered, in spite of the artistic disgust he felt for\\nall that zinc, coloured to imitate bronze, and having all the repulsive\\nmendacious prettiness of spurious art.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good morning, monsieur. Is Henri still at home?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe manufacturer, a stout, sallow-looking man, drew himself straight\\namidst all his nosegay vases and cruets and statuettes. He had in\\nhis hand a new model of a thermometer, formed of a juggling girl who\\ncrouched and balanced the glass tube on her nose.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Henri did not come in to lunch,â\\x80\\x99 he answered drily.\\n\\nThis cool reception upset Claude. â\\x80\\x98Ah! he did not come back; I beg\\npardon for having disturbed you, then. Good-day, monsieur.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-day.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOnce more outside, Claude began to swear to himself. His ill-luck was\\ncomplete, Fagerolles escaped him also. He even felt vexed with himself\\nfor having gone there, and having taken an interest in that picturesque\\nold street; he was infuriated by the romantic gangrene that ever\\nsprouted afresh within him, do what he might. It was his malady,\\nperhaps, the false principle which he sometimes felt like a bar across\\nhis skull. And when he had reached the quays again, he thought of going\\nhome to see whether his picture was really so very bad. But the mere\\nidea made him tremble all over. His studio seemed a chamber of horrors,\\nwhere he could no more continue to live, as if, indeed, he had left the\\ncorpse of some beloved being there. No, no; to climb the three flights\\nof stairs, to open the door, to shut himself up face to face with\\nâ\\x80\\x98that,â\\x80\\x99 would have needed strength beyond his courage. So he crossed\\nthe Seine and went along the Rue St. Jacques. He felt too wretched and\\nlonely; and, come what might, he would go to the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Enfer to turn\\nSandoz from his work.\\n\\nSandozâ\\x80\\x99s little fourth-floor flat consisted of a dining-room, a bedroom,\\nand a strip of kitchen. It was tenanted by himself alone; his mother,\\ndisabled by paralysis, occupied on the other side of the landing a\\nsingle room, where she lived in morose and voluntary solitude. The\\nstreet was a deserted one; the windows of the rooms overlooked the\\ngardens of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, above which rose the rounded crest\\nof a lofty tree, and the square tower of St. Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.\\n\\nClaude found Sandoz in his room, bending over his table, busy with a\\npage of â\\x80\\x98copy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am disturbing you?â\\x80\\x99 said Claude.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not at all. I have been working ever since morning, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough\\nof it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been killing myself for the last hour over a sentence that\\nreads anyhow, and which has worried me all through my lunch.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter made a gesture of despair, and the other, seeing him so\\ngloomy, at once understood matters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You donâ\\x80\\x99t get on either, eh? Well, letâ\\x80\\x99s go out. A sharp walk will take\\na little of the rust off us. Shall we go?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs he was passing the kitchen, however, an old woman stopped him. It was\\nhis charwoman, who, as a rule, came only for two hours in the morning\\nand two hours in the evening. On Thursdays, however, she remained the\\nwhole afternoon in order to look after the dinner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then itâ\\x80\\x99s decided, monsieur?â\\x80\\x99 she asked. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s to be a piece of skate\\nand a leg of mutton, with potatoes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, if you like.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98For how many am I to lay the cloth?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! as for that, one never knows. Lay for five, at any rate; weâ\\x80\\x99ll see\\nafterwards. Dinner at seven, eh? weâ\\x80\\x99ll try to be home by then.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhen they were on the landing, Sandoz, leaving Claude to wait for\\nhim, stole into his motherâ\\x80\\x99s room. When he came out again, in the same\\ndiscreet affectionate manner, they both went downstairs in silence.\\nOutside, having sniffed to right and left, as if to see which way the\\nwind blew, they ended by going up the street, reached the Place de\\nlâ\\x80\\x99Observatoire, and turned down the Boulevard du Montparnasse. This was\\ntheir ordinary promenade; they reached the spot instinctively, being\\nfond of the wide expanse of the outer boulevards, where they could roam\\nand lounge at ease. They continued silent, for their heads were heavy\\nstill, but the comfort of being together gradually made them more\\nserene. Still it was only when they were opposite the Western Railway\\nStation that Sandoz spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, suppose we go to Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s, to see how heâ\\x80\\x99s getting on with\\nhis big machine. I know that he has given â\\x80\\x9chis gods and saintsâ\\x80\\x9d the slip\\nto-day.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right,â\\x80\\x99 answered Claude. â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s go to Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey at once turned into the Rue du Cherche-Midi. There, at a few steps\\nfrom the boulevard, Mahoudeau, a sculptor, had rented the shop of a\\nfruiterer who had failed in business, and he had installed his studio\\ntherein, contenting himself with covering the windows with a layer of\\nwhitening. At this point, the street, wide and deserted, has a quiet,\\nprovincial aspect, with a somewhat ecclesiastical touch. Large gateways\\nstand wide open showing a succession of deep roomy yards; from a\\ncowkeeperâ\\x80\\x99s establishment comes a tepid, pungent smell of litter; and\\nthe dead wall of a convent stretches away for a goodly length. It was\\nbetween this convent and a herbalistâ\\x80\\x99s that the shop transformed into\\na studio was situated. It still bore on its sign-board the inscription,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Fruit and Vegetables,â\\x80\\x99 in large yellow letters.\\n\\nClaude and Sandoz narrowly missed being blinded by some little girls who\\nwere skipping in the street. On the foot pavement sat several families\\nwhose barricades of chairs compelled the friends to step down on to\\nthe roadway. However, they were drawing nigh, when the sight of the\\nherbalistâ\\x80\\x99s shop delayed them for a moment. Between its windows, decked\\nwith enemas, bandages, and similar things, beneath the dried herbs\\nhanging above the doorway, whence came a constant aromatic smell, a\\nthin, dark woman stood taking stock of them, while, behind her, in\\nthe gloom of the shop, one saw the vague silhouette of a little\\nsickly-looking man, who was coughing and expectorating. The friends\\nnudged each other, their eyes lighted up with bantering mirth; and then\\nthey turned the handle of Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s door.\\n\\nThe shop, though tolerably roomy, was almost filled by a mass of clay:\\na colossal Bacchante, falling back upon a rock. The wooden stays bent\\nbeneath the weight of that almost shapeless pile, of which nothing but\\nsome huge limbs could as yet be distinguished. Some water had been spilt\\non the floor, several muddy buckets straggled here and there, while\\na heap of moistened plaster was lying in a corner. On the shelves,\\nformerly occupied by fruit and vegetables, were scattered some casts\\nfrom the antique, covered with a tracery of cinder-like dust which had\\ngradually collected there. A wash-house kind of dampness, a stale\\nsmell of moist clay, rose from the floor. And the wretchedness of this\\nsculptorâ\\x80\\x99s studio and the dirt attendant upon the profession were made\\nstill more conspicuous by the wan light that filtered through the shop\\nwindows besmeared with whitening.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! is it you?â\\x80\\x99 shouted Mahoudeau, who sat before his female figure,\\nsmoking a pipe.\\n\\nHe was small and thin, with a bony face, already wrinkled at\\ntwenty-seven. His black mane-like hair lay entangled over his very low\\nforehead, and his sallow mask, ugly almost to ferociousness, was lighted\\nup by a pair of childish eyes, bright and empty, which smiled with\\nwinning simplicity. The son of a stonemason of Plassans, he had achieved\\ngreat success at the local art competitions, and had afterwards come to\\nParis as the town laureate, with an allowance of eight hundred francs\\nper annum, for a period of four years. In the capital, however, he had\\nfound himself at sea, defenceless, failing in his competitions at the\\nSchool of Arts, and spending his allowance to no purpose; so that, at\\nthe end of his term, he had been obliged for a livelihood to enter the\\nemployment of a dealer in church statues, at whose establishment,\\nfor ten hours a day, he scraped away at St. Josephs, St. Rochs, Mary\\nMagdalens, and, in fact, all the saints of the calendar. For the last\\nsix months, however, he had experienced a revival of ambition, on\\nfinding himself once more among his comrades of Provence, the eldest of\\nwhom he was--fellows whom he had known at Geraudâ\\x80\\x99s boarding-school for\\nlittle boys, and who had since grown into savage revolutionaries. At\\npresent, through his constant intercourse with impassioned artists, who\\ntroubled his brain with all sorts of wild theories, his ambition aimed\\nat the gigantic.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The devil!â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, â\\x80\\x98thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lump.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe sculptor, delighted, gave a long pull at his pipe, and blew a cloud\\nof smoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it? I am going to give them some flesh, and living flesh,\\ntoo; not the bladders of lard that they turn out.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s a woman bathing, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No; I shall put some vine leaves around her head. A Bacchante, you\\nunderstand.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this Claude flew into a violent passion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A Bacchante? Do you want to make fools of people? Does such a thing as\\na Bacchante exist? A vintaging girl, eh? And quite modern, dash it all.\\nI know sheâ\\x80\\x99s nude, so let her be a peasant woman who has undressed.\\nAnd that must be properly conveyed, mind; people must realise that she\\nlives.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMahoudeau, taken aback, listened, trembling. He was afraid of Claude,\\nand bowed to his ideal of strength and truth. So he even improved upon\\nthe painterâ\\x80\\x99s idea.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I meant to say--a vintaging girl. And youâ\\x80\\x99ll see\\nwhether there isnâ\\x80\\x99t a real touch of woman about her.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt that moment Sandoz, who had been making the tour of the huge block of\\nclay, exclaimed: â\\x80\\x98Why, hereâ\\x80\\x99s that sneak of a Chaine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBehind the pile, indeed, sat Chaine, a burly fellow who was quietly\\npainting away, copying the fireless rusty stove on a small canvas. It\\ncould be told that he was a peasant by his heavy, deliberate manner and\\nhis bull-neck, tanned and hardened like leather. His only noticeable\\nfeature was his forehead, displaying all the bumps of obstinacy; for his\\nnose was so small as to be lost between his red cheeks, while a stiff\\nbeard hid his powerful jaws. He came from Saint Firmin, a village about\\nsix miles from Plassans, where he had been a cow-boy, until he drew for\\nthe conscription; and his misfortunes dated from the enthusiasm that a\\ngentleman of the neighbourhood had shown for the walking-stick handles\\nwhich he carved out of roots with his knife. From that moment, having\\nbecome a rustic genius, an embryo great man for this local connoisseur,\\nwho happened to be a member of the museum committee, he had been helped\\nby him, adulated and driven crazy with hopes; but he had successively\\nfailed in everything--his studies and competitions--thus missing the\\ntownâ\\x80\\x99s purse. Nevertheless, he had started for Paris, after worrying his\\nfather, a wretched peasant, into premature payment of his heritage, a\\nthousand francs, on which he reckoned to live for a twelvemonth while\\nawaiting the promised victory. The thousand francs had lasted eighteen\\nmonths. Then, as he had only twenty francs left, he had taken up his\\nquarters with his friend, Mahoudeau. They both slept in the same bed, in\\nthe dark back shop; they both in turn cut slices from the same loaves\\nof bread--of which they bought sufficient for a fortnight at a time, so\\nthat it might get very hard, and that they might thus be able to eat but\\nlittle of it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, Chaine,â\\x80\\x99 continued Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98your stove is really very exact.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChaine, without answering, gave a chuckle of triumph which lighted up\\nhis face like a sunbeam. By a crowning stroke of imbecility, and to\\nmake his misfortunes perfect, his protectorâ\\x80\\x99s advice had thrown him into\\npainting, in spite of the real taste that he showed for wood carving.\\nAnd he painted like a whitewasher, mixing his colours as a hodman mixes\\nhis mortar, and managing to make the clearest and brightest of them\\nquite muddy. His triumph consisted, however, in combining exactness\\nwith awkwardness; he displayed all the naive minuteness of the primitive\\npainters; in fact, his mind, barely raised from the clods, delighted in\\npetty details. The stove, with its perspective all awry, was tame and\\nprecise, and in colour as dingy as mire.\\n\\nClaude approached and felt full of compassion at the sight of that\\npainting, and though he was as a rule so harsh towards bad painters, his\\ncompassion prompted him to say a word of praise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! one canâ\\x80\\x99t say that you are a trickster; you paint, at any rate, as\\nyou feel. Very good, indeed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, the door of the shop had opened, and a good-looking, fair\\nfellow, with a big pink nose, and large, blue, short-sighted eyes,\\nentered shouting:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, why does that herbalist woman next door always stand on her\\ndoorstep? What an ugly mug sheâ\\x80\\x99s got!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all laughed, except Mahoudeau, who seemed very much embarrassed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Jory, the King of Blunderers,â\\x80\\x99 declared Sandoz, shaking hands with the\\nnew comer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why? What? Is Mahoudeau interested in her? I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x99 resumed\\nJory, when he had at length grasped the situation. â\\x80\\x98Well, well, what\\ndoes it matter? When everythingâ\\x80\\x99s said, they are all irresistible.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As for you,â\\x80\\x99 the sculptor rejoined, â\\x80\\x98I can see you have tumbled on your\\nlady-loveâ\\x80\\x99s finger-nails again. She has dug a bit out of your cheek!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all burst out laughing anew, while Jory, in his turn, reddened. In\\nfact, his face was scratched: there were even two deep gashes across it.\\nThe son of a magistrate of Plassans, whom he had driven half-crazy by\\nhis dissolute conduct, he had crowned everything by running away with\\na music-hall singer under the pretext of going to Paris to follow the\\nliterary profession. During the six months that they had been camping\\ntogether in a shady hotel of the Quartier Latin, the girl had almost\\nflayed him alive each time she caught him paying attention to anybody\\nelse of her sex. And, as this often happened, he always had some fresh\\nscar to show--a bloody nose, a torn ear, or a damaged eye, swollen and\\nblackened.\\n\\nAt last they all began to talk, with the exception of Chaine, who went\\non painting with the determined expression of an ox at the plough. Jory\\nhad at once gone into ecstasies over the roughly indicated figure of\\nthe vintaging girl. He worshipped a massive style of beauty. His first\\nwritings in his native town had been some Parnassian sonnets celebrating\\nthe copious charms of a handsome pork-butcheress. In Paris--where he\\nhad fallen in with the whole band of Plassans--he had taken to art\\ncriticism, and, for a livelihood, he wrote articles for twenty francs\\napiece in a small, slashing paper called â\\x80\\x98The Drummer.â\\x80\\x99 Indeed, one\\nof these articles, a study on a picture by Claude exhibited at Papa\\nMalgrasâ\\x80\\x99s, had just caused a tremendous scandal; for Jory had therein\\nrun down all the painters whom the public appreciated to extol his\\nfriend, whom he set up as the leader of a new school, the school of the\\nâ\\x80\\x98open air.â\\x80\\x99 Very practical at heart, he did not care in reality a rap\\nabout anything that did not conduce to his own pleasures; he simply\\nrepeated the theories he heard enunciated by his friends. â\\x80\\x98I say,\\nMahoudeau,â\\x80\\x99 he now exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98you shall have an article; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll launch\\nthat woman of yours. What limbs, my boys! Sheâ\\x80\\x99s magnificent!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen suddenly changing the conversation: â\\x80\\x98By the way,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98my\\nmiserly father has apologised. He is afraid I shall drag his name\\nthrough the mud, so he sends me a hundred francs a month now. I am\\npaying my debts.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Debts! you are too careful to have any,â\\x80\\x99 muttered Sandoz, with a smile.\\n\\nIn fact, Jory displayed a hereditary tightness of fist which much amused\\nhis friends. He managed to lead a profligate life without money and\\nwithout incurring debts; and with the skill he thus displayed was\\nallied constant duplicity, a habit of incessantly lying, which he had\\ncontracted in the devout sphere of his family, where his anxiety to\\nhide his vices had made him lie about everything at all hours, and even\\nwithout occasion. But he now gave a superb reply, the cry of a sage of\\ndeep experience.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, you fellows, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know the worth of money!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis time he was hooted. What a philistine! And the invectives\\ncontinued, when some light taps on one of the window-panes suddenly made\\nthe din cease.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98She is really becoming a nuisance,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, with a gesture of\\nannoyance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh? Who is it? The herbalist woman?â\\x80\\x99 asked Jory. â\\x80\\x98Let her come in; it\\nwill be great fun.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe door indeed had already been opened, and Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s neighbour,\\nMadame Jabouille, or Mathilde, as she was familiarly called, appeared\\non the threshold. She was about thirty, with a flat face horribly\\nemaciated, and passionate eyes, the lids of which had a bluish tinge as\\nif they were bruised. It was said that some members of the clergy had\\nbrought about her marriage with little Jabouille, at a time when the\\nlatterâ\\x80\\x99s business was still flourishing, thanks to the custom of all\\nthe pious folk of the neighbourhood. The truth was, that one sometimes\\nespied black cassocks stealthily crossing that mysterious shop, where\\nall the aromatic herbs set a perfume of incense. A kind of cloistral\\nquietude pervaded the place; the devotees who came in spoke in low\\nvoices, as if in a confessional, slipped their purchases into their bags\\nfurtively, and went off with downcast eyes. Unfortunately, some very\\nhorrid rumours had got abroad--slander invented by the wine-shop\\nkeeper opposite, said pious folks. At any rate, since the widower had\\nre-married, the business had been going to the dogs. The glass jars\\nseemed to have lost all their brightness, and the dried herbs, suspended\\nfrom the ceiling, were tumbling to dust. Jabouille himself was coughing\\nhis life out, reduced to a very skeleton. And although Mathilde\\nprofessed to be religious, the pious customers gradually deserted\\nher, being of opinion that she made herself too conspicuous with young\\nfellows of the neighbourhood now that Jabouille was almost eaten out of\\nhouse and home.\\n\\nFor a moment Mathilde remained motionless, blinking her eyes. A pungent\\nsmell had spread through the shop, a smell of simples, which she brought\\nwith her in her clothes and greasy, tumbled hair; the sickly sweetness\\nof mallow, the sharp odour of elderseed, the bitter effluvia of rhubarb,\\nbut, above all, the hot whiff of peppermint, which seemed like her very\\nbreath.\\n\\nShe made a gesture of feigned surprise. â\\x80\\x98Oh, dear me! you have\\ncompany--I did not know; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll drop in again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, do,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, looking very vexed. â\\x80\\x98Besides, I am going out;\\nyou can give me a sitting on Sunday.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this Claude, stupefied, fairly stared at the emaciated Mathilde, and\\nthen at the huge vintaging woman.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What?â\\x80\\x99 he cried, â\\x80\\x98is it madame who poses for that figure? The dickens,\\nyou exaggerate!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen the laughter began again, while the sculptor stammered his\\nexplanations. â\\x80\\x98Oh! she only poses for the head and the hands, and merely\\njust to give me a few indications.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMathilde, however, laughed with the others, with a sharp, brazen-faced\\nlaughter, showing the while the gaping holes in her mouth, where several\\nteeth were wanting.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Mahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98I have to go out on some business now. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nit so, you fellows, we are expected over yonder?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had winked at his friends, feeling eager for a good lounge. They all\\nanswered that they were expected, and helped him to cover the figure of\\nthe vintaging girl with some strips of old linen which were soaking in a\\npail of water.\\n\\nHowever, Mathilde, looking submissive but sad, did not stir. She merely\\nshifted from one place to another, when they pushed against her, while\\nChaine, who was no longer painting, glanced at her over his picture. So\\nfar, he had not opened his lips. But as Mahoudeau at last went off with\\nhis three friends, he made up his mind to ask, in his husky voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Shall you come home to-night?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very late. Have your dinner and go to bed. Good-bye.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Chaine remained alone with Mathilde in the damp shop, amidst the\\nheaps of clay and the puddles of water, while the chalky light from the\\nwhitened windows glared crudely over all the wretched untidiness.\\n\\nMeantime the four others, Claude and Mahoudeau, Jory and Sandoz,\\nstrolled along, seeming to take up the whole width of the Boulevard des\\nInvalides. It was the usual thing, the band was gradually increased by\\nthe accession of comrades picked up on the way, and then came the wild\\nmarch of a horde upon the war-path. With the bold assurance of their\\ntwenty summers, these young fellows took possession of the foot\\npavement. The moment they were together trumpets seemed to sound in\\nadvance of them; they seized upon Paris and quietly dropped it into\\ntheir pockets. There was no longer the slightest doubt about their\\nvictory; they freely displayed their threadbare coats and old shoes,\\nlike destined conquerors of to-morrow who disdained bagatelles, and\\nhad only to take the trouble to become the masters of all the luxury\\nsurrounding them. And all this was attended by huge contempt for\\neverything that was not art--contempt for fortune, contempt for the\\nworld at large, and, above all, contempt for politics. What was the good\\nof all such rubbish? Only a lot of incapables meddled with it. A warped\\nview of things, magnificent in its very injustice, exalted them; an\\nintentional ignorance of the necessities of social life, the crazy dream\\nof having none but artists upon earth. They seemed very stupid at times,\\nbut, all the same, their passion made them strong and brave.\\n\\nClaude became excited. Faith in himself revived amidst the glow of\\ncommon hopes. His worry of the morning had only left a vague numbness\\nbehind, and he now once more began to discuss his picture with Sandoz\\nand Mahoudeau, swearing, it is true, that he would destroy it the next\\nday. Jory, who was very short-sighted, stared at all the elderly ladies\\nhe met, and aired his theories on artistic work. A man ought to give his\\nfull measure at once in the first spurt of inspiration; as for himself,\\nhe never corrected anything. And, still discussing, the four friends\\nwent on down the boulevard, which, with its comparative solitude, and\\nits endless rows of fine trees, seemed to have been expressly designed\\nas an arena for their disputations. When they reached the Esplanade,\\nthe wrangling became so violent that they stopped in the middle of that\\nlarge open space. Beside himself, Claude called Jory a numskull; was it\\nnot better to destroy oneâ\\x80\\x99s work than to launch a mediocre performance\\nupon the world? Truckling to trade was really disgusting. Mahoudeau\\nand Sandoz, on their side, shouted both together at the same time. Some\\npassers-by, feeling uneasy, turned round to look, and at last gathered\\nround these furious young fellows, who seemed bent on swallowing each\\nother. But they went off vexed, thinking that some practical joke had\\nbeen played upon them, when they suddenly saw the quartette, all good\\nfriends again, go into raptures over a wet-nurse, dressed in light\\ncolours, with long cherry-tinted ribbons streaming from her cap. There,\\nnow! That was something like--what a tint, what a bright note it set\\namid the surroundings! Delighted, blinking their eyes, they followed the\\nnurse under the trees, and then suddenly seemed roused and astonished\\nto find they had already come so far. The Esplanade, open on all\\nsides, save on the south, where rose the distant pile of the Hotel des\\nInvalides, delighted them--it was so vast, so quiet; they there had\\nplenty of room for their gestures; and they recovered breath there,\\nalthough they were always declaring that Paris was far too small for\\nthem, and lacked sufficient air to inflate their ambitious lungs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you going anywhere particular?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz of Mahoudeau and Jory.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 answered the latter, â\\x80\\x98we are going with you. Where are _you_\\ngoing?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, gazing carelessly about him, muttered: â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. That way,\\nif you like.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey turned on to the Quai dâ\\x80\\x99Orsay, and went as far as the Pont de la\\nConcorde. In front of the Corps Legislatif the painter remarked, with an\\nair of disgust: â\\x80\\x98What a hideous pile!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Jules Favre made a fine speech the other day. How he did rile Rouher,â\\x80\\x99\\nsaid Jory.\\n\\nHowever, the others left him no time to proceed, the disputes began\\nafresh. â\\x80\\x98Who was Jules Favre? Who was Rouher? Did they exist? A parcel\\nof idiots whom no one would remember ten years after their death.â\\x80\\x99 The\\nyoung men had now begun to cross the bridge, and they shrugged their\\nshoulders with compassion. Then, on reaching the Place de la Concorde,\\nthey stopped short and relapsed into silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 opined Claude at last, â\\x80\\x98this isnâ\\x80\\x99t bad, by any means.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and the day was waning amidst a glorious powdery\\nshimmer. To the right and left, towards the Madeleine and towards the\\nCorps Legislatif, lines of buildings stretched away, showing against\\nthe sky, while in the Tuileries Gardens rose gradients of lofty rounded\\nchestnut trees. And between the verdant borders of the pleasure walks,\\nthe avenue of the Champs Elysees sloped upward as far as the eye could\\nreach, topped by the colossal Arc de Triomphe, agape in front of the\\ninfinite. A double current, a twofold stream rolled along--horses\\nshowing like living eddies, vehicles like retreating waves, which the\\nreflections of a panel or the sudden sparkle of the glass of a carriage\\nlamp seemed to tip with white foam. Lower down, the square--with its\\nvast footways, its roads as broad as lakes--was filled with a constant\\nebb and flow, crossed in every direction by whirling wheels, and peopled\\nwith black specks of men, while the two fountains plashed and streamed,\\nexhaling delicious coolness amid all the ardent life.\\n\\nClaude, quivering with excitement, kept saying: â\\x80\\x98Ah! Paris! Itâ\\x80\\x99s ours.\\nWe have only to take it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all grew excited, their eyes opened wide with desire. Was it not\\nglory herself that swept from the summit of that avenue over the whole\\ncapital? Paris was there, and they longed to make her theirs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, weâ\\x80\\x99ll take her one day,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, with his obstinate air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98To be sure we shall,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau and Jory in the simplest manner.\\n\\nThey had resumed walking; they still roamed about, found themselves\\nbehind the Madeleine, and went up the Rue Tronchet. At last, as they\\nreached the Place du Havre, Sandoz exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98So we are going to\\nBaudequinâ\\x80\\x99s, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe others looked as if they had dropped from the sky; in fact, it did\\nseem as if they were going to Baudequinâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What day of the week is it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Claude. â\\x80\\x98Thursday, eh? Then\\nFagerolles and Gagniere are sure to be there. Letâ\\x80\\x99s go to Baudequinâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd thereupon they went up the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Amsterdam. They had just crossed\\nParis, one of their favourite rambles, but they took other routes at\\ntimes--from one end of the quays to the other; or from the Porte St.\\nJacques to the Moulineaux, or else to Pere-la-Chaise, followed by a\\nroundabout return along the outer boulevards. They roamed the streets,\\nthe open spaces, the crossways; they rambled on for whole days, as long\\nas their legs would carry them, as if intent on conquering one\\ndistrict after another by hurling their revolutionary theories at the\\nhouse-fronts; and the pavement seemed to be their property--all the\\npavement touched by their feet, all that old battleground whence arose\\nintoxicating fumes which made them forget their lassitude.\\n\\nThe Cafe Baudequin was situated on the Boulevard des Batignolles, at\\nthe corner of the Rue Darcet. Without the least why or wherefore, it had\\nbeen selected by the band as their meeting-place, though Gagniere alone\\nlived in the neighbourhood. They met there regularly on Sunday nights;\\nand on Thursday afternoons, at about five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, those who were then\\nat liberty had made it a habit to look in for a moment. That day, as the\\nweather was fine and bright, the little tables outside under the awning\\nwere occupied by rows of customers, obstructing the footway. But the\\nband hated all elbowing and public exhibition, so they jostled the other\\npeople in order to go inside, where all was deserted and cool.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, thereâ\\x80\\x99s Fagerolles by himself,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude.\\n\\nHe had gone straight to their usual table at the end of the cafe, on\\nthe left, where he shook hands with a pale, thin, young man, whose pert\\ngirlish face was lighted up by a pair of winning, satirical grey eyes,\\nwhich at times flashed like steel. They all sat down and ordered beer,\\nafter which the painter resumed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do you know that I went to look for you at your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s; and a nice\\nreception he gave me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles, who affected a low devil-may-care style, slapped his thighs.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, the old fellow plagues me! I hooked it this morning, after a row.\\nHe wants me to draw some things for his beastly zinc stuff. As if I\\nhadnâ\\x80\\x99t enough zinc stuff at the Art School.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis slap at the professors delighted the young manâ\\x80\\x99s friends. He amused\\nthem and made himself their idol by dint of alternate flattery and\\nblame. His smile went from one to the other, while, by the aid of a few\\ndrops of beer spilt on the table, his long nimble fingers began tracing\\ncomplicated sketches. His art evidently came very easily to him; it\\nseemed as if he could do anything with a turn of the hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And Gagniere?â\\x80\\x99 asked Mahoudeau; â\\x80\\x98havenâ\\x80\\x99t you seen him?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No; I have been here for the last hour.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust then Jory, who had remained silent, nudged Sandoz, and directed his\\nattention to a girl seated with a gentleman at a table at the back of\\nthe room. There were only two other customers present, two sergeants,\\nwho were playing cards. The girl was almost a child, one of those young\\nParisian hussies who are as lank as ever at eighteen. She suggested a\\nfrizzy poodle--with the shower of fair little locks that fell over\\nher dainty little nose, and her large smiling mouth, set between rosy\\ncheeks. She was turning over the leaves of an illustrated paper, while\\nthe gentleman accompanying her gravely sipped a glass of Madeira;\\nbut every other minute she darted gay glances from over the newspaper\\ntowards the band of artists.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pretty, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she?â\\x80\\x99 whispered Jory. â\\x80\\x98Who is she staring at? Why, sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlooking at me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Fagerolles suddenly broke in: â\\x80\\x98I say, no nonsense. Donâ\\x80\\x99t imagine\\nthat I have been here for the last hour merely waiting for you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe others laughed; and lowering his voice he told them about the girl,\\nwho was named Irma Becot. She was the daughter of a grocer in the Rue\\nMontorgueil, and had been to school in the neighbourhood till she\\nwas sixteen, writing her exercises between two bags of lentils, and\\nfinishing off her education on her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s doorstep, lolling about on\\nthe pavement, amidst the jostling of the throng, and learning all about\\nlife from the everlasting tittle-tattle of the cooks, who retailed all\\nthe scandal of the neighbourhood while waiting for five sousâ\\x80\\x99 worth of\\nGruyere cheese to be served them. Her mother having died, her father\\nhimself had begun to lead rather a gay life, in such wise that the\\nwhole of the grocery stores--tea, coffee, dried vegetables, and jars and\\ndrawers of sweetstuff--were gradually devoured. Irma was still going to\\nschool, when, one day, the place was sold up. Her father died of a fit\\nof apoplexy, and Irma sought refuge with a poor aunt, who gave her more\\nkicks than halfpence, with the result that she ended by running away,\\nand taking her flight through all the dancing-places of Montmartre and\\nBatignolles.\\n\\nClaude listened to the story with his usual air of contempt for women.\\nSuddenly, however, as the gentleman rose and went out after whispering\\nin her ear, Irma Becot, after watching him disappear, bounded from\\nher seat with the impulsiveness of a school girl, in order to join\\nFagerolles, beside whom she made herself quite at home, giving him a\\nsmacking kiss, and drinking out of his glass. And she smiled at the\\nothers in a very engaging manner, for she was partial to artists,\\nand regretted that they were generally so miserably poor. As Jory was\\nsmoking, she took his cigarette out of his mouth and set it in her own,\\nbut without pausing in her chatter, which suggested that of a saucy\\nmagpie.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are all painters, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you? How amusing! But why do those three\\nlook as if they were sulking. Just laugh a bit, or I shall make you,\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll see!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, Sandoz, Claude, and Mahoudeau, quite taken aback,\\nwere watching her most gravely. She herself remained listening, and,\\non hearing her companion come back, she hastily gave Fagerolles an\\nappointment for the morrow. Then, after replacing the cigarette between\\nJoryâ\\x80\\x99s lips, she strode off with her arms raised, and making a very\\ncomical grimace; in such wise that when the gentleman reappeared,\\nlooking sedate and somewhat pale, he found her in her former seat, still\\nlooking at the same engraving in the newspaper. The whole scene had been\\nacted so quickly, and with such jaunty drollery, that the two sergeants\\nwho sat nearby, good-natured fellows both of them, almost died of\\nlaughter as they shuffled their cards afresh.\\n\\nIn fact, Irma had taken them all by storm. Sandoz declared that her\\nname of Becot was very well suited for a novel; Claude asked whether she\\nwould consent to pose for a sketch; while Mahoudeau already pictured her\\nas a Paris gamin, a statuette that would be sure to sell. She soon went\\noff, however, and behind the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s back she wafted kisses to the\\nwhole party, a shower of kisses which quite upset the impressionable\\nJory.\\n\\nIt was five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and the band ordered some more beer. Some of the\\nusual customers had taken possession of the adjacent tables, and these\\nphilistines cast sidelong glances at the artistsâ\\x80\\x99 corner, glances in\\nwhich contempt was curiously mingled with a kind of uneasy deference.\\nThe artists were indeed well known; a legend was becoming current\\nrespecting them. They themselves were now talking on common-place\\nsubjects: about the heat, the difficulty of finding room in the omnibus\\nto the Odeon, and the discovery of a wine-shop where real meat was\\nobtainable. One of them wanted to start a discussion about a number of\\nidiotic pictures that had lately been hung in the Luxembourg Museum; but\\nthere was only one opinion on the subject, that the pictures were not\\nworth their frames. Thereupon they left off conversing; they smoked,\\nmerely exchanging a word or a significant smile now and then.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 asked Claude at last, â\\x80\\x98are we going to wait for Gagniere?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this there was a protest. Gagniere was a bore. Besides, he would turn\\nup as soon as he smelt the soup.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s be off, then,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a leg of mutton this\\nevening, so letâ\\x80\\x99s try to be punctual.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nEach paid his score, and they all went out. Their departure threw the\\ncafe into a state of emotion. Some young fellows, painters, no doubt,\\nwhispered together as they pointed at Claude, much in the same manner\\nas if he were the redoubtable chieftain of a horde of savages. Joryâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfamous article was producing its effect; the very public was becoming\\nhis accomplice, and of itself was soon to found that school of the open\\nair, which the band had so far only joked about. As they gaily said, the\\nCafe Baudequin was not aware of the honour they had done it on the day\\nwhen they selected it to be the cradle of a revolution.\\n\\nFagerolles having reinforced the group, they now numbered five, and\\nslowly they took their way across Paris, with their tranquil look of\\nvictory. The more numerous they were, the more did they stretch across\\nthe pavement, and carry away on their heels the burning life of the\\nstreets. When they had gone down the Rue de Clichy, they went straight\\nalong the Rue de la Chaussee dâ\\x80\\x99Antin, turned towards the Rue de\\nRichelieu, crossed the Seine by the Pont des Arts, so as to fling their\\ngibes at the Institute, and finally reached the Luxembourg by way of\\nthe Rue de Seine, where a poster, printed in three colours, the\\ngarish announcement of a travelling circus, made them all shout with\\nadmiration. Evening was coming on; the stream of wayfarers flowed more\\nslowly; the tired city was awaiting the shadows of night, ready to yield\\nto the first comer who might be strong enough to take her.\\n\\nOn reaching the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Enfer, when Sandoz had ushered his four friends\\ninto his own apartments, he once more vanished into his motherâ\\x80\\x99s room.\\nHe remained there for a few moments, and then came out without saying\\na word, but with the tender, gentle smile habitual to him on such\\noccasions. And immediately afterwards a terrible hubbub, of laughter,\\nargument, and mere shouting, arose in his little flat. Sandoz himself\\nset the example, all the while assisting the charwoman, who burst into\\nbitter language because it was half-past seven, and her leg of mutton\\nwas drying up. The five companions, seated at table, were already\\nswallowing their soup, a very good onion soup, when a new comer suddenly\\nappeared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! hereâ\\x80\\x99s Gagniere,â\\x80\\x99 was the vociferous chorus.\\n\\nGagniere, short, slight, and vague looking, with a doll-like startled\\nface, set off by a fair curly beard, stood for a moment on the threshold\\nblinking his green eyes. He belonged to Melun, where his well-to-do\\nparents, who were both dead, had left him two houses; and he had learnt\\npainting, unassisted, in the forest of Fontainebleau. His landscapes\\nwere at least conscientiously painted, excellent in intention; but his\\nreal passion was music, a madness for music, a cerebral bonfire which\\nset him on a level with the wildest of the band.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Am I in the way?â\\x80\\x99 he gently asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not at all; come in!â\\x80\\x99 shouted Sandoz.\\n\\nThe charwoman was already laying an extra knife and fork.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Suppose she lays a place for Dubuche, while she is about it,â\\x80\\x99 said\\nClaude. â\\x80\\x98He told me he would perhaps come.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut they were all down upon Dubuche, who frequented women in society.\\nJory said that he had seen him in a carriage with an old lady and her\\ndaughter, whose parasols he was holding on his knees.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where have you come from to be so late?â\\x80\\x99 asked Fagerolles of Gagniere.\\n\\nThe latter, who was about to swallow his first spoonful of soup, set it\\nin his plate again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I was in the Rue de Lancry--you know, where they have chamber music.\\nOh! my boy, some of Schumannâ\\x80\\x99s machines! You havenâ\\x80\\x99t an idea of them!\\nThey clutch hold of you at the back of your head just as if somebody\\nwere breathing down your back. Yes, yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s something much more\\nimmaterial than a kiss, just a whiff of breath. â\\x80\\x98Pon my honour, a fellow\\nfeels as if he were going to die.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis eyes were moistening and he turned pale, as if experiencing some\\nover-acute enjoyment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eat your soup,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau; â\\x80\\x98youâ\\x80\\x99ll tell us all about it\\nafterwards.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe skate was served, and they had the vinegar bottle put on the table\\nto improve the flavour of the black butter, which seemed rather insipid.\\nThey ate with a will, and the hunks of bread swiftly disappeared. There\\nwas nothing refined about the repast, and the wine was mere common\\nstuff, which they watered considerably from a feeling of delicacy, in\\norder to lessen their hostâ\\x80\\x99s expenses. They had just saluted the leg of\\nmutton with a hurrah, and the host had begun to carve it, when the door\\nopened anew. But this time there were furious protests.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no, not another soul! Turn him out, turn him out.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDubuche, out of breath with having run, bewildered at finding himself\\namidst such howling, thrust his fat, pallid face forward, whilst\\nstammering explanations.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Really, now, I assure you it was the fault of the omnibuses. I had to\\nwait for five of them in the Champs Elysees.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no, heâ\\x80\\x99s lying!--Let him go, he shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t have any of that mutton.\\nTurn him out, turn him out!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAll the same, he ended by coming in, and it was then noticed that he\\nwas stylishly attired, all in black, trousers and frock-coat alike, and\\ncravated and booted in the stiff ceremonious fashion of some respectable\\nmember of the middle classes going out to dinner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! he has missed his invitation,â\\x80\\x99 chaffed Fagerolles. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\nsee that his fine ladies didnâ\\x80\\x99t ask him to stay to dinner, and so now\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s come to gobble up our leg of mutton, as he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know where else\\nto go?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this Dubuche turned red, and stammered: â\\x80\\x98Oh! what an idea! How\\nill-natured you are! And, besides, just attend to your own business.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz and Claude, seated next to each other, smiled, and the former,\\nbeckoning to Dubuche, said to him: â\\x80\\x98Lay your own place, bring a plate\\nand a glass, and sit between us--like that, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll leave you alone.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, the chaff continued all the time that the mutton was being\\neaten. When the charwoman had brought Dubuche a plate of soup and a\\npiece of skate, he himself fell in with the jokes good-naturedly. He\\npretended to be famished, greedily mopped out his plate, and related a\\nstory about a mother having refused him her daughter because he was an\\narchitect. The end of the dinner thus became very boisterous; they all\\nrattled on together. The only dessert, a piece of Brie cheese, met with\\nenormous success. Not a scrap of it was left, and the bread almost ran\\nshort. The wine did run short, so they each swallowed a clear draught\\nof water, smacking their lips the while amidst great laughter. And, with\\nfaces beaming, and well-filled paunches, they passed into the bedroom\\nwith the supreme content of folks who have fared very sumptuously\\nindeed.\\n\\nThose were Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s jolly evenings. Even at the times when he was\\nhard up he had always had some boiled beef and broth to share with his\\ncomrades. He felt delighted at having a number of them around him, all\\nfriends, inspired by the same ideas. Though he was of their own age, he\\nbeamed with fatherly feelings and satisfied good-nature when he saw them\\nin his rooms, around him, hand in hand, and intoxicated with hope. As he\\nhad but two rooms, the bedroom did duty as a drawing-room, and became as\\nmuch theirs as his. For lack of sufficient chairs, two or three had to\\nseat themselves on the bed. And on those warm summer evenings the window\\nremained wide open to let in the air. From it two black silhouettes were\\nto be seen rising above the houses, against the clear sky--the tower of\\nSt. Jacques du Haut-Pas and the tree of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum. When\\nmoney was plentiful there was beer. Every one brought his own tobacco,\\nthe room soon became full of smoke, and without seeing each other they\\nended by conversing far into the night, amidst the deep mournful silence\\nof that deserted district.\\n\\nOn that particular evening, at about nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the charwoman came\\nin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Monsieur, I have done. Can I go?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, go to bed. You have left the kettle on the fire, havenâ\\x80\\x99t you? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nmake the tea myself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz had risen. He went off at the heels of the charwoman, and only\\nreturned a quarter of an hour afterwards. He had no doubt been to kiss\\nhis mother, whom he tucked up every night before she dozed off.\\n\\nMeanwhile the voices had risen to a high pitch again. Fagerolles was\\ntelling a story.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, old fellow; at the School they even correct Nature herself.\\nThe other day Mazel comes up to me and says: â\\x80\\x9cThose two arms donâ\\x80\\x99t\\ncorrespondâ\\x80\\x9d; whereupon I reply: â\\x80\\x9cLook for yourself, monsieur--the\\nmodelâ\\x80\\x99s are like that.â\\x80\\x9d It was little Flore Beauchamp, you know. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d\\n Mazel furiously replies, â\\x80\\x9cif she has them like that, itâ\\x80\\x99s very wrong of\\nher.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey almost all shrieked, especially Claude, to whom Fagerolles told\\nthe story by way of paying court. For some time previously the younger\\nartist had yielded to the elderâ\\x80\\x99s influence; and although he continued\\nto paint with purely tricky skill, he no longer talked of anything\\nbut substantial, thickly-painted work, of bits of nature thrown on to\\ncanvas, palpitating with life, such as they really were. This did not\\nprevent him, though, from elsewhere chaffing the adepts of the open-air\\nschool, whom he accused of impasting with a kitchen ladle.\\n\\nDubuche, who had not laughed, his sense of rectitude being offended,\\nmade so bold as to reply:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why do you stop at the School if you think you are being brutified\\nthere? Itâ\\x80\\x99s simple enough, one goes away--Oh, I know you are all against\\nme, because I defend the School. But, you see, my idea is that, when a\\nfellow wants to carry on a trade, it is not a bad thing for him to begin\\nby learning it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFerocious shouts arose at this, and Claude had need of all his authority\\nto secure a hearing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He is right. One must learn oneâ\\x80\\x99s trade. But it wonâ\\x80\\x99t do to learn it\\nunder the ferule of professors who want to cram their own views forcibly\\ninto your nut. That Mazel is a perfect idiot!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe flung himself backward on the bed, on which he had been sitting, and\\nwith his eyes raised to the ceiling, he went on, in an excited tone:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! life! life! to feel it and portray it in its reality, to love it\\nfor itself, to behold in it the only real, lasting, and changing beauty,\\nwithout any idiotic idea of ennobling it by mutilation. To understand\\nthat all so-called ugliness is nothing but the mark of individual\\ncharacter, to create real men and endow them with life--yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nonly way to become a god!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis faith was coming back to him, the march across Paris had spurred him\\non once more; he was again seized by his passion for living flesh. They\\nlistened to him in silence. He made a wild gesture, then calmed down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No doubt every one has his own ideas; but the annoyance is that at\\nthe Institute they are even more intolerant than we are. The hanging\\ncommittee of the Salon is in their hands. I am sure that that idiot\\nMazel will refuse my picture.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon they all broke out into imprecations, for this question of\\nthe hanging committee was the everlasting subject of their wrath. They\\ndemanded reforms; every one had a solution of the problem ready--from\\nuniversal suffrage, applied to the election of a hanging committee,\\nliberal in the widest sense of the word, down to unrestricted liberty, a\\nSalon open to all exhibitors.*\\n\\n  * The reader will bear in mind that all these complaints made by\\n    Claude and his friends apply to the old Salons, as organized\\n    under Government control, at the time of the Second Empire.--ED.\\n\\nWhile the others went on discussing the subject, Gagniere drew Mahoudeau\\nto the open window, where, in a low voice, his eyes the while staring\\ninto space, he murmured:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, itâ\\x80\\x99s nothing at all, only four bars; a simple impression jotted\\ndown there and then. But what a deal there is in it! To me itâ\\x80\\x99s first\\nof all a landscape, dwindling away in the distance; a bit of melancholy\\nroad, with the shadow of a tree that one cannot see; and then a woman\\npasses along, scarcely a silhouette; on she goes and you never meet her\\nagain, no, never more again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust at that moment, however, Fagerolles exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98I say, Gagniere,\\nwhat are you going to send to the Salon this year?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere did not hear, but continued talking, enraptured, as it were.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98In Schumann one finds everything--the infinite. And Wagner, too, whom\\nthey hissed again last Sunday!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut a fresh call from Fagerolles made him start.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh! what? What am I going to send to the Salon? A small landscape,\\nperhaps; a little bit of the Seine. It is so difficult to decide; first\\nof all I must feel pleased with it myself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had suddenly become timid and anxious again. His artistic scruples,\\nhis conscientiousness, kept him working for months on a canvas the size\\nof oneâ\\x80\\x99s hand. Following the track of the French landscape painters,\\nthose masters who were the first to conquer nature, he worried about\\ncorrectness of tone, pondering and pondering over the precise value of\\ntints, till theoretical scruples ended by making his touch heavy. And he\\noften did not dare to chance a bright dash of colour, but painted in\\na greyish gloomy key which was astonishing, when one remembered his\\nrevolutionary passions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98For my part,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, â\\x80\\x98I feel delighted at the prospect of\\nmaking them squint with my woman.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude shrugged his shoulders. â\\x80\\x98Oh! youâ\\x80\\x99ll get in, the sculptors have\\nbroader minds than the painters. And, besides, you know very well what\\nyou are about; you have something at your fingersâ\\x80\\x99 ends that pleases.\\nThere will be plenty of pretty bits about your vintaging girl.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe compliment made Mahoudeau feel serious. He posed above all for\\nvigour of execution; he was unconscious of his real vein of talent, and\\ndespised gracefulness, though it ever invincibly sprung from his big,\\ncoarse fingers--the fingers of an untaught working-man--like a flower\\nthat obstinately sprouts from the hard soil where the wind has flung its\\nseed.\\n\\nFagerolles, who was very cunning, had decided to send nothing, for fear\\nof displeasing his masters; and he chaffed the Salon, calling it â\\x80\\x98a foul\\nbazaar, where all the bad painting made even the good turn musty.â\\x80\\x99 In\\nhis inmost heart he was dreaming of one day securing the Rome prize,\\nthough he ridiculed it, as he did everything else.\\n\\nHowever, Jory stationed himself in the middle of the room, holding up\\nhis glass of beer. Sipping every now and then, he declared: â\\x80\\x98Well, your\\nhanging committee quite disgusts me! I say, shall I demolish it? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nbegin bombarding it in our very next number. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll give me some notes,\\neh? and weâ\\x80\\x99ll knock it to pieces. That will be fine fun.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was at last fully wound up, and general enthusiasm prevailed.\\nYes, yes, they must start a campaign. They would all be in it, and,\\npressing shoulder to shoulder, march to the battle together. At that\\nmoment there was not one of them who reserved his share of fame, for\\nnothing divided them as yet; neither the profound dissemblance of their\\nvarious natures, of which they themselves were ignorant, nor their\\nrivalries, which would some day bring them into collision. Was not\\nthe success of one the success of all the others? Their youth was\\nfermenting, they were brimming over with mutual devotion; they indulged\\nanew in their everlasting dream of gathering into a phalanx to conquer\\nthe world, each contributing his individual effort; this one helping\\nthat one forward, and the whole band reaching fame at once in one row.\\nClaude, as the acknowledged chief, was already sounding the victory,\\ndistributing laurels with such lyrical abundance that he overlooked\\nhimself. Fagerolles himself, gibing Parisian though he might be,\\nbelieved in the necessity of forming an army; while even Jory, although\\nhe had a coarser appetite, with a deal of the provincial still about\\nhim, displayed much useful comradeship, catching various artistic\\nphrases as they fell from his companionsâ\\x80\\x99 lips, and already preparing in\\nhis mind the articles which would herald the advent of the band and\\nmake them known. And Mahoudeau purposely exaggerated his intentional\\nroughness, and clasped his hands like an ogre kneading human flesh;\\nwhile Gagniere, in ecstasy, as if freed from the everlasting greyishness\\nof his art, sought to refine sensation to the utmost limits of\\nintelligence; and Dubuche, with his matter-of-fact convictions, threw in\\nbut a word here and there; words, however, which were like club-blows\\nin the very midst of the fray. Then Sandoz, happy and smiling at seeing\\nthem so united, â\\x80\\x98all in one shirt,â\\x80\\x99 as he put it, opened another bottle\\nof beer. He would have emptied every one in the house.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh?â\\x80\\x99 he cried, â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99re agreed, letâ\\x80\\x99s stick to it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s really pleasant\\nto come to an understanding among fellows who have something in their\\nnuts, so may the thunderbolts of heaven sweep all idiots away!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt that same moment a ring at the bell stupefied him. Amidst the sudden\\nsilence of the others, he inquired--â\\x80\\x98Who, to the deuce, can that be--at\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe ran to open the door, and they heard him utter a cry of delight.\\nHe was already coming back again, throwing the door wide open as he\\nsaid--â\\x80\\x98Ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s very kind indeed to think of us and surprise us like\\nthis! Bongrand, gentlemen.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe great painter, whom the master of the house announced in this\\nrespectfully familiar way, entered, holding out both hands. They all\\neagerly rose, full of emotion, delighted with that manly, cordial\\nhandshake so willingly bestowed. Bongrand was then forty-five years\\nold, stout, and with a very expressive face and long grey hair. He had\\nrecently become a member of the Institute, and wore the rosette of\\nan officer of the Legion of Honour in the top button-hole of his\\nunpretentious alpaca jacket. He was fond of young people; he liked\\nnothing so much as to drop in from time to time and smoke a pipe among\\nthese beginners, whose enthusiasm warmed his heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am going to make the tea,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Sandoz.\\n\\nWhen he came back from the kitchen, carrying the teapot and cups, he\\nfound Bongrand installed astride a chair, smoking his short cutty,\\namidst the din which had again arisen. Bongrand himself was holding\\nforth in a stentorian voice. The grandson of a farmer of the Beauce\\nregion, the son of a man risen to the middle classes, with peasant blood\\nin his veins, indebted for his culture to a mother of very artistic\\ntastes, he was rich, had no need to sell his pictures, and retained many\\ntastes and opinions of Bohemian life.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The hanging committee? Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99d sooner hang myself than belong to\\nit!â\\x80\\x99 said he, with sweeping gestures. â\\x80\\x98Am I an executioner to kick poor\\ndevils, who often have to earn their bread, out of doors?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Still, you might render us great service by defending our pictures\\nbefore the committee,â\\x80\\x99 observed Claude.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, dear, no! I should only make matters worse for you--I donâ\\x80\\x99t count;\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m nobody.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a chorus of protestations; Fagerolles objected, in a shrill\\nvoice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, if the painter of â\\x80\\x9cThe Village Weddingâ\\x80\\x9d does not count--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Bongrand was getting angry; he had risen, his cheeks afire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh? Donâ\\x80\\x99t pester me with â\\x80\\x9cThe Weddingâ\\x80\\x9d; I warn you I am getting sick of\\nthat picture. It is becoming a perfect nightmare to me ever since it has\\nbeen hung in the Luxembourg Museum.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis â\\x80\\x98Village Weddingâ\\x80\\x99--a party of wedding guests roaming through a\\ncorn-field, peasants studied from life, with an epic look of the heroes\\nof Homer about them--had so far remained his masterpiece. The picture\\nhad brought about an evolution in art, for it had inaugurated a new\\nformula. Coming after Delacroix, and parallel with Courbet, it was\\na piece of romanticism tempered by logic, with more correctness of\\nobservation, more perfection in the handling. And though it did not\\nsquarely tackle nature amidst the crudity of the open air, the new\\nschool claimed connection with it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There can be nothing more beautiful,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, â\\x80\\x98than the two first\\ngroups, the fiddler, and then the bride with the old peasant.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And the strapping peasant girl, too,â\\x80\\x99 added Mahoudeau; the one who\\nis turning round and beckoning! I had a great mind to take her for the\\nmodel of a statue.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And that gust of wind among the corn,â\\x80\\x99 added Gagniere, â\\x80\\x98and the pretty\\nbit of the boy and girl skylarking in the distance.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand sat listening with an embarrassed air, and a smile of inward\\nsuffering; and when Fagerolles asked him what he was doing just then, he\\nanswered, with a shrug of his shoulders:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, nothing; some little things. But I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t exhibit this time.\\nI should like to find a telling subject. Ah, you fellows are happy at\\nstill being at the bottom of the hill. A man has good legs then, he\\nfeels so plucky when itâ\\x80\\x99s a question of getting up. But when once he is\\na-top, the deuce take it! the worries begin. A real torture, fisticuffs,\\nefforts which must be constantly renewed, lest one should slip down too\\nquickly. Really now, one would prefer being below, for the pleasure of\\nstill having everything to do--Ah, you may laugh, but youâ\\x80\\x99ll see it all\\nfor yourselves some day!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey were indeed laughing, thinking it a paradox, or a little piece of\\naffectation, which they excused. To be hailed, like Bongrand, with the\\nname of master--was that not the height of bliss? He, with his arms\\nresting on the back of his chair, listened to them in silence, leisurely\\npuffing his pipe, and renouncing the idea of trying to make them\\nunderstand him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dubuche, who had rather domesticated tastes, helped Sandoz\\nto hand the tea round, and the din continued. Fagerolles related a story\\nabout Daddy Malgras and a female cousin by marriage, whom the dealer\\noffered as a model on conditions that he was given a presentment of her\\nin oils. Then they began to talk of models. Mahoudeau waxed furious,\\nbecause the really well-built female models were disappearing. It was\\nimpossible to find one with a decent figure now. Then suddenly the\\ntumult increased again; Gagniere was being congratulated about a\\nconnoisseur whose acquaintance he had made in the Palais Royal one\\nafternoon, while the band played, an eccentric gentleman living on a\\nsmall income, who never indulged in any other extravagance than that of\\nbuying pictures. The other artists laughed and asked for the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\naddress. Then they fell foul of the picture dealers, dirty black-guards,\\nwho preyed on artists and starved them. It was really a pity that\\nconnoisseurs mistrusted painters to such a degree as to insist upon\\na middleman under the impression that they would thus make a better\\nbargain. This question of bread and butter excited them yet more, though\\nClaude showed magnificent contempt for it all. The artist was robbed,\\nno doubt, but what did that matter, if he had painted a masterpiece,\\nand had some water to drink? Jory, having again expressed some low ideas\\nabout lucre, aroused general indignation. Out with the journalist!\\nHe was asked stringent questions. Would he sell his pen? Would he not\\nsooner chop off his wrist than write anything against his convictions?\\nBut they scarcely waited for his answer, for the excitement was on the\\nincrease; it became the superb madness of early manhood, contempt for\\nthe whole world, an absorbing passion for good work, freed from all\\nhuman weaknesses, soaring in the sky like a very sun. Ah! how strenuous\\nwas their desire to lose themselves, consume themselves, in that brazier\\nof their own kindling!\\n\\nBongrand, who had not stirred the while, made a vague gesture of\\nsuffering at the sight of that boundless confidence, that boisterous\\njoy at the prospect of attack. He forgot the hundred paintings which\\nhad brought him his glory, he was thinking of the work which he had left\\nroughed out on his easel now. Taking his cutty from between his lips, he\\nmurmured, his eyes glistening with kindliness, â\\x80\\x98Oh, youth, youth!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nUntil two in the morning, Sandoz, who seemed ubiquitous, kept on pouring\\nfresh supplies of hot water into the teapot. From the neighbourhood,\\nnow asleep, one now only heard the miawing of an amorous tabby. They all\\ntalked at random, intoxicated by their own words, hoarse with shouting,\\ntheir eyes scorched, and when at last they made up their minds to go,\\nSandoz took the lamp to show them a light over the banisters, saying\\nvery softly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t make a noise, my mother is asleep.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe hushed tread of their boots on the stairs died away at last, and\\ndeep silence fell upon the house.\\n\\nIt struck four. Claude, who had accompanied Bongrand, still went on\\ntalking to him in the deserted streets. He did not want to go to bed; he\\nwas waiting for daylight, with impatient fury, so that he might set\\nto work at his picture again. This time he felt certain of painting a\\nmasterpiece, exalted as he was by that happy day of good-fellowship,\\nhis mind pregnant with a world of things. He had discovered at last what\\npainting meant, and he pictured himself re-entering his studio as one\\nreturns into the presence of a woman one adores, his heart throbbing\\nviolently, regretting even this one dayâ\\x80\\x99s absence, which seemed to him\\nendless desertion. And he would go straight to his canvas, and realise\\nhis dream in one sitting. However, at every dozen steps or so, amidst\\nthe flickering light of the gaslamps, Bongrand caught him by a button\\nof his coat, to repeat to him that, after all, painting was an accursed\\ntrade. Sharp as he, Bongrand, was supposed to be, he did not understand\\nit yet. At each new work he undertook, he felt as if he were making a\\ndebut; it was enough to make one smash oneâ\\x80\\x99s head against the wall. The\\nsky was now brightening, some market gardenersâ\\x80\\x99 carts began rolling down\\ntowards the central markets; and the pair continued chattering, each\\ntalking for himself, in a loud voice, beneath the paling stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\nSIX weeks later, Claude was painting one morning amidst a flood of\\nsunshine that streamed through the large window of his studio. Constant\\nrain had made the middle of August very dull, but his courage for\\nwork returned with the blue sky. His great picture did not make much\\nprogress, albeit he worked at it throughout long, silent mornings, like\\nthe obstinate, pugnacious fellow he was.\\n\\nAll at once there came a knock at his door. He thought that Madame\\nJoseph, the doorkeeper, was bringing up his lunch, and as the key was\\nalways in the door, he simply called: â\\x80\\x98Come in!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe door had opened; there was a slight rustle, and then all became\\nstill. He went on painting without even turning his head. But the\\nquivering silence, and the consciousness of some vague gentle breathing\\nnear him, at last made him fidgety. He looked up, and felt amazed; a\\nwoman stood there clad in a light gown, her features half-hidden by a\\nwhite veil, and he did not know her, and she was carrying a bunch of\\nroses, which completed his bewilderment.\\n\\nAll at once he recognised her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You, mademoiselle? Well, I certainly didnâ\\x80\\x99t expect you!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was Christine. He had been unable to restrain that somewhat unamiable\\nexclamation, which was a cry from the heart itself. At first he had\\ncertainly thought of her; then, as the days went by for nearly a couple\\nof months without sign of life from her, she had become for him merely a\\nfleeting, regretted vision, a charming silhouette which had melted away\\nin space, and would never be seen again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, monsieur, itâ\\x80\\x99s I. I wished to come. I thought it was wrong not to\\ncome and thank you--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe blushed and stammered, at a loss for words. She was out of breath,\\nno doubt through climbing the stairs, for her heart was beating fast.\\nWhat! was this long-debated visit out of place after all? It had ended\\nby seeming quite natural to her. The worst was that, in passing along\\nthe quay, she had bought that bunch of roses with the delicate intention\\nof thereby showing her gratitude to the young fellow, and the flowers\\nnow dreadfully embarrassed her. How was she to give them to him? What\\nwould he think of her? The impropriety of the whole proceeding had only\\nstruck her as she opened the door.\\n\\nBut Claude, more embarrassed still, resorted to exaggerated politeness.\\nHe had thrown aside his palette and was turning the studio upside down\\nin order to clear a chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pray be seated, mademoiselle. This is really a surprise. You are too\\nkind.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOnce seated, Christine recovered her equanimity. He looked so droll with\\nhis wild sweeping gestures, and she felt so conscious of his shyness\\nthat she began to smile, and bravely held out the bunch of roses.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look here; I wished to show you that I am not ungrateful.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt first he said nothing, but stood staring at her, thunderstruck. When\\nhe saw, though, that she was not making fun of him, he shook both her\\nhands, with almost sufficient energy to dislocate them. Then he at once\\nput the flowers in his water-jug, repeating:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! now you are a good fellow, you really are. This is the first time I\\npay that compliment to a woman, honour bright.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe came back to her, and, looking straight into her eyes, he asked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then you have not altogether forgotten me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You see that I have not,â\\x80\\x99 she replied, laughing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, then, did you wait two months before coming to see me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAgain she blushed. The falsehood she was about to tell revived her\\nembarrassment for a moment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you know that I am not my own mistress,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98Oh, Madame\\nVanzade is very kind to me, only she is a great invalid, and never\\nleaves the house. But she grew anxious as to my health and compelled me\\nto go out to breathe a little fresh air.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe did not allude to the shame which she had felt during the first\\nfew days after her adventure on the Quai de Bourbon. Finding herself in\\nsafety, beneath the old ladyâ\\x80\\x99s roof, the recollection of the night she\\nhad spent in Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s room had filled her with remorse; but she fancied\\nat last that she had succeeded in dismissing the matter from her mind.\\nIt was no longer anything but a bad dream, which grew more indistinct\\neach day. Then, how it was she could not tell, but amidst the profound\\nquietude of her existence, the image of that young man who had\\nbefriended her had returned to her once more, becoming more and more\\nprecise, till at last it occupied her daily thoughts. Why should she\\nforget him? She had nothing to reproach him with; on the contrary, she\\nfelt she was his debtor. The thought of seeing him again, dismissed\\nat first, struggled against later on, at last became an all-absorbing\\ncraving. Each evening the temptation to go and see him came strong upon\\nher in the solitude of her own room. She experienced an uncomfortable\\nirritating feeling, a vague desire which she could not define, and only\\ncalmed down somewhat on ascribing this troubled state of mind to a wish\\nto evince her gratitude. She was so utterly alone, she felt so stifled\\nin that sleepy abode, the exuberance of youth seethed so strongly within\\nher, her heart craved so desperately for friendship!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So I took advantage of my first day out,â\\x80\\x99 she continued. â\\x80\\x98And besides,\\nthe weather was so nice this morning after all the dull rain.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, feeling very happy and standing before her, also confessed\\nhimself, but _he_ had nothing to hide.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98For my part,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98I dared not think of you any more. You are like\\none of the fairies of the story-books, who spring from the floor and\\ndisappear into the walls at the very moment one least expects it; arenâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou now? I said to myself, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s all over: it was perhaps only in my\\nfancy that I saw her come to this studio.â\\x80\\x9d Yet here you are. Well, I am\\npleased at it, very pleased indeed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSmiling, but embarrassed, Christine averted her head, pretending to\\nlook around her. But her smile soon died away. The ferocious-looking\\npaintings which she again beheld, the glaring sketches of the South, the\\nterrible anatomical accuracy of the studies from the nude, all chilled\\nher as on the first occasion. She became really afraid again, and she\\nsaid gravely, in an altered voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am disturbing you; I am going.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! not at all, not at all,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, preventing her from\\nrising. â\\x80\\x98It does me good to have a talk with you, for I was working\\nmyself to death. Oh! that confounded picture; itâ\\x80\\x99s killing me as it is.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon Christine, lifting her eyes, looked at the large picture, the\\ncanvas that had been turned to the wall on the previous occasion, and\\nwhich she had vainly wished to see.\\n\\nThe background--the dark glade pierced by a flood of sunlight--was still\\nonly broadly brushed in. But the two little wrestlers--the fair one and\\nthe dark--almost finished by now, showed clearly in the light. In the\\nforeground, the gentleman in the velveteen jacket, three times begun\\nafresh, had now been left in distress. The painter was more particularly\\nworking at the principal figure, the woman lying on the grass. He had\\nnot touched the head again. He was battling with the body, changing his\\nmodel every week, so despondent at being unable to satisfy himself\\nthat for a couple of days he had been trying to improve the figure from\\nimagination, without recourse to nature, although he boasted that he\\nnever invented.\\n\\nChristine at once recognised herself. Yes, that nude girl sprawling on\\nthe grass, one arm behind her head, smiling with lowered eyelids, was\\nherself, for she had her features. The idea absolutely revolted her, and\\nshe was wounded too by the wildness of the painting, so brutal indeed\\nthat she considered herself abominably insulted. She did not understand\\nthat kind of art; she thought it execrable, and felt a hatred against\\nit, the instinctive hatred of an enemy. She rose at last, and curtly\\nrepeated, â\\x80\\x98I must be going.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude watched her attentively, both grieved and surprised by her sudden\\nchange of manner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Going already?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, they are waiting for me. Good-bye.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd she had already reached the door before he could take her hand, and\\nventure to ask her:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98When shall I see you again?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe allowed her hand to remain in his. For a moment she seemed to\\nhesitate.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. I am so busy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen she withdrew her hand and went off, hastily, saying: â\\x80\\x98One of these\\ndays, when I can. Good-bye.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude remained stock-still on the threshold. He wondered what had come\\nover her again to cause her sudden coolness, her covert irritation.\\nHe closed the door, and walked about, with dangling arms, and without\\nunderstanding, seeking vainly for the phrase, the gesture that could\\nhave offended her. And he in his turn became angry, and launched an oath\\ninto space, with a terrific shrug of the shoulders, as if to rid himself\\nof this silly worry. Did a man ever understand women? However, the sight\\nof the roses, overlapping the water-jug, pacified him; they smelt so\\nsweet. Their scent pervaded the whole studio, and silently he resumed\\nhis work amidst the perfume.\\n\\nTwo more months passed by. During the earlier days Claude, at the\\nslightest stir of a morning, when Madame Joseph brought him up his\\nbreakfast or his letters, quickly turned his head, and could not control\\na gesture of disappointment. He no longer went out until after four, and\\nthe doorkeeper having told him one evening, on his return home, that a\\nyoung person had called to see him at about five, he had only grown calm\\non ascertaining that the visitor was merely a model, Zoe Piedefer. Then,\\nas the days went by, he was seized with a furious fit of work, becoming\\nunapproachable to every one, indulging in such violent theories that\\neven his friends did not venture to contradict him. He swept the world\\nfrom his path with one gesture; there was no longer to be anything\\nbut painting left. One might murder oneâ\\x80\\x99s parents, comrades, and women\\nespecially, and it would all be a good riddance. After this terrible\\nfever he fell into abominable despondency, spending a week of impotence\\nand doubt, a whole week of torture, during which he fancied himself\\nstruck silly. But he was getting over it, he had resumed his usual life,\\nhis resigned solitary struggle with his great picture, when one foggy\\nmorning, towards the end of October, he started and hastily set his\\npalette aside. There had been no knock, but he had just recognised the\\nfootfall coming up the stairs. He opened the door and she walked in. She\\nhad come at last.\\n\\nChristine that day wore a large cloak of grey material which enveloped\\nher from head to foot. Her little velvet hat was dark, and the fog\\noutside had pearled her black lace veil. But he thought her looking very\\ncheerful, with the first slight shiver of winter upon her. She at once\\nbegan to make excuses for having so long delayed her return. She smiled\\nat him in her pretty candid manner, confessed that she had hesitated,\\nand that she had almost made up her mind to come no more. Yes, she had\\nher own opinions about things, which she felt sure he understood. As it\\nhappened, he did not understand at all--he had no wish to understand,\\nseeing that she was there. It was quite sufficient that she was not\\nvexed with him, that she would consent to look in now and then like a\\nchum. There were no explanations; they kept their respective torments\\nand the struggles of recent times to themselves. For nearly an hour they\\nchatted together right pleasantly, with nothing hidden nor antagonistic\\nremaining between them; it was as if an understanding had been arrived\\nat, unknown to themselves, and while they were far apart. She did not\\neven appear to notice the sketches and studies on the walls. For a\\nmoment she looked fixedly at the large picture, at the figure of the\\nwoman lying on the grass under the blazing golden sun. No, it was not\\nlike herself, that girl had neither her face nor her body. How silly\\nto have fancied that such a horrid mess of colour was herself! And her\\nfriendship for the young fellow was heightened by a touch of pity; he\\ncould not even convey a likeness. When she went off, it was she who on\\nthe threshold cordially held out her hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You know, I shall come back again--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, in two monthsâ\\x80\\x99 time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, next week. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see, next Thursday.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn the Thursday she punctually returned, and after that she did not miss\\na week. At first she had no particular day for calling, simply taking\\nadvantage of her opportunities; but subsequently she selected Monday,\\nthe day allowed her by Madame Vanzade in order that she might have a\\nwalk in the fresh, open air of the Bois de Boulogne. She had to be back\\nhome by eleven, and she walked the whole way very quickly, coming in all\\naglow from the run, for it was a long stretch from Passy to the Quai de\\nBourbon. During four winter months, from October to February, she came\\nin this fashion, now in drenching rain, now among the mists from the\\nSeine, now in the pale sunlight that threw a little warmth over the\\nquays. Indeed, after the first month, she at times arrived unexpectedly,\\ntaking advantage of some errand in town to look in, and then she could\\nonly stay for a couple of minutes; they had barely had time enough to\\nsay â\\x80\\x98How do you do?â\\x80\\x99 when she was already scampering down the stairs\\nagain, exclaiming â\\x80\\x98Good-bye.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd now Claude learned to know Christine. With his everlasting mistrust\\nof woman a suspicion had remained to him, the suspicion of some love\\nadventure in the provinces; but the girlâ\\x80\\x99s soft eyes and bright laughter\\nhad carried all before them; he felt that she was as innocent as a big\\nchild. As soon as she arrived, quite unembarrassed, feeling fully at\\nher ease, as with a friend, she began to indulge in a ceaseless flow\\nof chatter. She had told him a score of times about her childhood at\\nClermont, and she constantly reverted to it. On the evening that her\\nfather, Captain Hallegrain, had suddenly died, she and her mother had\\nbeen to church. She perfectly remembered their return home and the\\nhorrible night that had followed; the captain, very stout and muscular,\\nlying stretched on a mattress, with his lower jaw protruding to such a\\ndegree that in her girlish memory she could not picture him otherwise.\\nShe also had that same jaw, and when her mother had not known how to\\nmaster her, she had often cried: â\\x80\\x98Ah, my girl, youâ\\x80\\x99ll eat your heartâ\\x80\\x99s\\nblood out like your father.â\\x80\\x99 Poor mother! how she, Christine, had\\nworried her with her love of horseplay, with her mad turbulent fits. As\\nfar back as she could remember, she pictured her mother ever seated at\\nthe same window, quietly painting fans, a slim little woman with very\\nsoft eyes, the only thing she had inherited of her. When people wanted\\nto please her mother they told her, â\\x80\\x98she has got your eyes.â\\x80\\x99 And then\\nshe smiled, happy in the thought of having contributed at least that\\ntouch of sweetness to her daughterâ\\x80\\x99s features. After the death of her\\nhusband, she had worked so late as to endanger her eyesight. But how\\nelse could she have lived? Her widowâ\\x80\\x99s pension--five hundred francs\\nper annum--barely sufficed for the needs of her child. For five years\\nChristine had seen her mother grow thinner and paler, wasting away a\\nlittle bit each day until she became a mere shadow. And now she felt\\nremorseful at not having been more obedient, at having driven her\\nmother to despair by lack of application. She had begun each week with\\nmagnificent intentions, promising that she would soon help her to earn\\nmoney; but her arms and legs got the fidgets, in spite of her efforts;\\nthe moment she became quiet she fell ill. Then one morning her mother\\nhad been unable to get up, and had died; her voice too weak to make\\nitself heard, her eyes full of big tears. Ever did Christine behold her\\nthus dead, with her weeping eyes wide open and fixed on her.\\n\\nAt other times, Christine, when questioned by Claude about Clermont,\\nforgot those sorrows to recall more cheerful memories. She laughed\\ngaily at the idea of their encampment, as she called it, in the Rue\\nde lâ\\x80\\x99Eclache; she born in Strasburg, her father a Gascon, her mother a\\nParisian, and all three thrown into that nook of Auvergne, which they\\ndetested. The Rue de lâ\\x80\\x99Eclache, sloping down to the Botanical Gardens,\\nwas narrow and dank, gloomy, like a vault. Not a shop, never a\\npasser-by--nothing but melancholy frontages, with shutters always\\nclosed. At the back, however, their windows, overlooking some\\ncourtyards, were turned to the full sunlight. The dining-room opened\\neven on to a spacious balcony, a kind of wooden gallery, whose arcades\\nwere hung with a giant wistaria which almost smothered them with\\nfoliage. And the girl had grown up there, at first near her invalid\\nfather, then cloistered, as it were, with her mother, whom the least\\nexertion exhausted. She had remained so complete a stranger to the town\\nand its neighbourhood, that Claude and herself burst into laughter when\\nshe met his inquiries with the constant answer, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x99 The\\nmountains? Yes, there were mountains on one side, they could be seen\\nat the end of the streets; while on the other side of the town, after\\npassing along other streets, there were flat fields stretching far away;\\nbut she never went there, the distance was too great. The only height\\nshe remembered was the Puy de Dome, rounded off at the summit like a\\nhump. In the town itself she could have found her way to the cathedral\\nblindfold; one had to turn round by the Place de Jaude and take the Rue\\ndes Gras; but more than that she could not tell him; the rest of the\\ntown was an entanglement, a maze of sloping lanes and boulevards; a town\\nof black lava ever dipping downward, where the rain of the thunderstorms\\nswept by torrentially amidst formidable flashes of lightning. Oh! those\\nstorms; she still shuddered to think of them. Just opposite her room,\\nabove the roofs, the lightning conductor of the museum was always on\\nfire. In the sitting-room she had her own window--a deep recess as big\\nas a room itself--where her work-table and personal nick-nacks stood.\\nIt was there that her mother had taught her to read; it was there that,\\nlater on, she had fallen asleep while listening to her masters, so\\ngreatly did the fatigue of learning daze her. And now she made fun of\\nher own ignorance; she was a well-educated young lady, and no mistake,\\nunable even to repeat the names of the Kings of France, with the dates\\nof their accessions; a famous musician too, who had never got further\\nthan that elementary pianoforte exercise, â\\x80\\x98The little boatsâ\\x80\\x99; a prodigy\\nin water-colour painting, who scamped her trees because foliage was too\\ndifficult to imitate. Then she skipped, without any transition, to the\\nfifteen months she had spent at the Convent of the Visitation after\\nher motherâ\\x80\\x99s death--a large convent, outside the town, with magnificent\\ngardens. There was no end to her stories about the good sisters, their\\njealousies, their foolish doings, their simplicity, that made one start.\\nShe was to have taken the veil, but she felt stifled the moment she\\nentered a church. It had seemed to be all over with her, when the\\nSuperior, by whom she was treated with great affection, diverted her\\nfrom the cloister by procuring her that situation at Madame Vanzadeâ\\x80\\x99s.\\nShe had not yet got over the surprise. How had Mother des Saints Anges\\nbeen able to read her mind so clearly? For, in fact, since she had\\nbeen living in Paris she had dropped into complete indifference about\\nreligion.\\n\\nWhen all the reminiscences of Clermont were exhausted, Claude wanted\\nto hear about her life at Madame Vanzadeâ\\x80\\x99s, and each week she gave him\\nfresh particulars. The life led in the little house at Passy, silent\\nand shut off from the outer world, was a very regular one, with no more\\nnoise about it than the faint tic-tac of an old-fashioned timepiece.\\nTwo antiquated domestics, a cook and a manservant, who had been with\\nthe family for forty years, alone glided in their slippers about the\\ndeserted rooms, like a couple of ghosts. Now and then, at very\\nlong intervals, there came a visitor: some octogenarian general, so\\ndesiccated, so slight of build that he scarcely pressed on the carpet.\\nThe house was also the home of shadows; the sun filtered with the mere\\ngleam of a night light through the Venetian blinds. Since madame had\\nbecome paralysed in the knees and stone blind, so that she no longer\\nleft her room, she had had no other recreation than that of listening\\nto the reading of religious books. Ah! those endless readings, how\\nthey weighed upon the girl at times! If she had only known a trade, how\\ngladly she would have cut out dresses, concocted bonnets, or goffered\\nthe petals of artificial flowers. And to think that she was capable of\\nnothing, when she had been taught everything, and that there was only\\nenough stuff in her to make a salaried drudge, a semi-domestic! She\\nsuffered horribly, too, in that stiff, lonely dwelling which smelt of\\nthe tomb. She was seized once more with the vertigo of her childhood, as\\nwhen she had striven to compel herself to work, in order to please\\nher mother; her blood rebelled; she would have liked to shout and jump\\nabout, in her desire for life. But madame treated her so gently, sending\\nher away from her room, and ordering her to take long walks, that she\\nfelt full of remoras when, on her return to the Quai de Bourbon, she was\\nobliged to tell a falsehood; to talk of the Bois de Boulogne or invent\\nsome ceremony at church where she now never set foot. Madame seemed to\\ntake to her more and more every day; there were constant presents, now a\\nsilk dress, now a tiny gold watch, even some underlinen. She herself was\\nvery fond of Madame Vanzade; she had wept one day when the latter had\\ncalled her daughter; she had sworn never to leave her, such was her\\nheart-felt pity at seeing her so old and helpless.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude one morning, â\\x80\\x98youâ\\x80\\x99ll be rewarded; sheâ\\x80\\x99ll leave you\\nher money.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine looked astonished. â\\x80\\x98Do you think so? It is said that she is\\nworth three millions of francs. No, no, I have never dreamt of such a\\nthing, and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t. What would become of me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude had averted his head, and hastily replied, â\\x80\\x98Well, youâ\\x80\\x99d become\\nrich, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. But no doubt sheâ\\x80\\x99ll first of all marry you off--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn hearing this, Christine could hold out no longer, but burst into\\nlaughter. â\\x80\\x98To one of her old friends, eh? perhaps the general who has a\\nsilver chin. What a good joke!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo far they had gone no further than chumming like old friends. He was\\nalmost as new to life as she, having had nothing but chance adventures,\\nand living in an ideal world of his own, fanciful amid romantic amours.\\nTo see each other in secret like this, from pure friendship, without\\nanything more tender passing between them than a cordial shake of the\\nhand at her arrival, and another one when she left, seemed to them quite\\nnatural. Still for her part she scented that he was shy, and at\\ntimes she looked at him fixedly, with the wondering perturbation of\\nunconscious passion. But as yet nothing ardent or agitating spoilt the\\npleasure they felt in being together. Their hands remained cool; they\\nspoke cheerfully on all subjects; they sometimes argued like friends,\\nwho feel sure they will not fall out. Only, this friendship grew so keen\\nthat they could no longer live without seeing one another.\\n\\nThe moment Christine came, Claude took the key from outside the door.\\nShe herself insisted upon this, lest somebody might disturb them. After\\na few visits she had taken absolute possession of the studio. She seemed\\nto be at home there. She was tormented by a desire to make the place\\na little more tidy, for such disorder worried her and made her\\nuncomfortable. But it was not an easy matter. The painter had strictly\\nforbidden Madame Joseph to sweep up things, lest the dust should get on\\nthe fresh paint. So, on the first occasions when his companion attempted\\nto clean up a bit, he watched her with anxious entreating eyes. What was\\nthe good of changing the place of things? Didnâ\\x80\\x99t it suffice to have them\\nat hand? However, she exhibited such gay determination, she seemed so\\nhappy at playing the housewife, that he let her have her own way at\\nlast. And now, the moment she had arrived and taken off her gloves, she\\npinned up her dress to avoid soiling it, and set the big studio in order\\nin the twinkling of an eye. There was no longer a pile of cinders before\\nthe stove; the screen hid the bedstead and the washstand; the couch\\nwas brushed, the wardrobe polished; the deal table was cleared of the\\ncrockery, and had not a stain of paint; and above the chairs, which\\nwere symmetrically arranged, and the spanned easels propped against the\\nwalls, the big cuckoo clock, with full-blown pink flowers on its dial,\\nseemed to tick more sonorously. Altogether it was magnificent; one would\\nnot have recognised the place. He, stupefied, watched her trotting\\nto and fro, twisting about and singing as she went. Was this then the\\nlazybones who had such dreadful headaches at the least bit of work? But\\nshe laughed; at headwork, yes; but exertion with her hands and feet did\\nher good, seemed to straighten her like a young sapling. She confessed,\\neven as she would have confessed some depraved taste, her liking for\\nlowly household cares; a liking which had greatly worried her mother,\\nwhose educational ideal consisted of accomplishments, and who would\\nhave made her a governess with soft hands, touching nothing vulgar. How\\nChristine had been chided indeed whenever she was caught, as a little\\ngirl, sweeping, dusting, and playing delightedly at being cook! Even\\nnowadays, if she had been able to indulge in a bout with the dust at\\nMadame Vanzadeâ\\x80\\x99s, she would have felt less bored. But what would they\\nhave said to that? She would no longer have been considered a lady. And\\nso she came to satisfy her longings at the Quai de Bourbon, panting with\\nthe exercise, all aglow, her eyes glistening with a womanâ\\x80\\x99s delight at\\nbiting into forbidden fruit.\\n\\nClaude by this time grew conscious of having a womanâ\\x80\\x99s care around him.\\nIn order to make her sit down and chat quietly, he would ask her now and\\nthen to sew a torn cuff or coat-tail. She herself had offered to look\\nover his linen; but it was no longer with the ardour of a housewife,\\neager to be up and doing. First of all, she hardly knew how to work; she\\nheld her needle like a girl brought up in contempt of sewing. Besides,\\nthe enforced quiescence and the attention that had to be given to\\nsuch work, the small stitches which had to be looked to one by one,\\nexasperated her. Thus the studio was bright with cleanliness like a\\ndrawing-room, but Claude himself remained in rags, and they both joked\\nabout it, thinking it great fun.\\n\\nHow happy were those months that they spent together, those four months\\nof frost and rain whiled away in the studio, where the red-hot stove\\nroared like an organ-pipe! The winter seemed to isolate them from the\\nworld still more. When the snow covered the adjacent roofs, when the\\nsparrows fluttered against the window, they smiled at feeling warm and\\ncosy, at being lost, as it were, amidst the great silent city. But\\nthey did not always confine themselves to that one little nook, for she\\nallowed him at last to see her home. For a long while she had insisted\\nupon going away by herself, feeling ashamed of being seen in the streets\\non a manâ\\x80\\x99s arm. Then, one day when the rain fell all of a sudden, she\\nwas obliged to let him come downstairs with an umbrella. The rain having\\nceased almost immediately, she sent him back when they reached the other\\nside of the Pont Louis-Philippe. They only remained a few moments beside\\nthe parapet, looking at the Mail, and happy at being together in the\\nopen air. Down below, large barges, moored against the quay, and full\\nof apples, were ranged four rows deep, so close together that the planks\\nthrown across them made a continuous path for the women and children\\nrunning to and fro. They were amused by the sight of all that fruit,\\nthose enormous piles littering the banks, the round baskets which were\\ncarried hither and thither, while a strong odour, suggestive of cider in\\nfermentation, mingled with the moist gusts from the river.\\n\\nA week later, when the sun again showed itself, and Claude extolled the\\nsolitude of the quays round the Isle Saint Louis, Christine consented to\\ntake a walk. They strolled up the Quai de Bourbon and the Quai dâ\\x80\\x99Anjou,\\npausing at every few steps and growing interested in the various scenes\\nof river life; the dredger whose buckets grated against their chains,\\nthe floating wash-house, which resounded with the hubbub of a quarrel,\\nand the steam cranes busy unloading the lighters. She did not cease to\\nwonder at one thought which came to her. Was it possible that yonder\\nQuai des Ormes, so full of life across the stream, that this Quai Henri\\nIV., with its broad embankment and lower shore, where bands of children\\nand dogs rolled over in the sand, that this panorama of an active,\\ndensely-populated capital was the same accursed scene that had appeared\\nto her for a moment in a gory flash on the night of her arrival? They\\nwent round the point of the island, strolling more leisurely still to\\nenjoy the solitude and tranquillity which the old historic mansions seem\\nto have implanted there. They watched the water seething between the\\nwooden piles of the Estacade, and returned by way of the Quai de Bethune\\nand the Quai dâ\\x80\\x99Orleans, instinctively drawn closer to each other by\\nthe widening of the stream, keeping elbow to elbow at sight of the vast\\nflow, with their eyes fixed on the distant Halle aux Vins and the\\nJardin des Plantes. In the pale sky, the cupolas of the public buildings\\nassumed a bluish hue. When they reached the Pont St. Louis, Claude had\\nto point out Notre-Dame by name, for Christine did not recognise\\nthe edifice from the rear, where it looked like a colossal creature\\ncrouching down between its flying buttresses, which suggested sprawling\\npaws, while above its long leviathan spine its towers rose like a double\\nhead. Their real find that day, however, was at the western point of\\nthe island, that point like the prow of a ship always riding at anchor,\\nafloat between two swift currents, in sight of Paris, but ever unable\\nto get into port. They went down some very steep steps there, and\\ndiscovered a solitary bank planted with lofty trees. It was a charming\\nrefuge--a hermitage in the midst of a crowd. Paris was rumbling around\\nthem, on the quays, on the bridges, while they at the waterâ\\x80\\x99s edge\\ntasted the delight of being alone, ignored by the whole world. From that\\nday forth that bank became a little rustic coign of theirs, a favourite\\nopen-air resort, where they took advantage of the sunny hours, when\\nthe great heat of the studio, where the red-hot stove kept roaring,\\noppressed them too much, filling their hands with a fever of which they\\nwere afraid.\\n\\nNevertheless, Christine had so far objected to be accompanied farther\\nthan the Mail. At the Quai des Ormes she always bade Claude go back,\\nas if Paris, with her crowds and possible encounters, began at the long\\nstretch of quays which she had to traverse on her way home. But Passy\\nwas so far off, and she felt so dull at having to go such a distance\\nalone, that gradually she gave way. She began by allowing Claude to see\\nher as far as the Hotel de Ville; then as far as the Pont-Neuf; at last\\nas far as the Tuileries. She forgot the danger; they walked arm in arm\\nlike a young married couple; and that constantly repeated promenade,\\nthat leisurely journey over the self-same ground by the river side,\\nacquired an infinite charm, full of a happiness such as could scarcely\\nbe surpassed in after-times. They truly belonged to each other, though\\nthey had not erred. It seemed as if the very soul of the great city,\\nrising from the river, wrapped them around with all the love that had\\nthrobbed behind the grey stone walls through the long lapse of ages.\\n\\nSince the nipping colds of December, Christine only came in the\\nafternoon, and it was about four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, when the sun was sinking, that\\nClaude escorted her back on his arm. On days when the sky was clear,\\nthey could see the long line of quays stretching away into space\\ndirectly they had crossed the Pont Louis-Philippe. From one end to the\\nother the slanting sun powdered the houses on the right bank with golden\\ndust, while, on the left, the islets, the buildings, stood out in a\\nblack line against the blazing glory of the sunset. Between the sombre\\nand the brilliant margin, the spangled river sparkled, cut in twain\\nevery now and then by the long bars of its bridges; the five arches of\\nthe Pont Notre-Dame showing under the single span of the Pont dâ\\x80\\x99Arcole;\\nthen the Pont-au-Change and the Pont-Neuf, beyond each of whose shadows\\nappeared a luminous patch, a sheet of bluish satiny water, growing\\npaler here and there with a mirror-like reflection. And while the dusky\\noutlines on the left terminated in the silhouettes of the pointed towers\\nof the Palais de Justice, sharply and darkly defined against the sky,\\na gentle curve undulated on the right, stretching away so far that the\\nPavillon de Flore, who stood forth like a citadel at the curveâ\\x80\\x99s extreme\\nend, seemed a fairy castle, bluey, dreamlike and vague, amidst the\\nrosy mist on the horizon. But Claude and Christine, with the sunlight\\nstreaming on them, athwart the leafless plane trees, turned away from\\nthe dazzlement, preferring to gaze at certain spots, one above all--a\\nblock of old houses just above the Mail. Below, there was a series of\\none-storied tenements, little huckster and fishing-tackle shops, with\\nflat terrace roofs, ornamented with laurel and Virginia creeper. And in\\nthe rear rose loftier, but decrepit, dwellings, with linen hung out to\\ndry at their windows, a collection of fantastic structures, a confused\\nmass of woodwork and masonry, overtoppling walls, and hanging gardens,\\nin which coloured glass balls shone out like stars. They walked on,\\nleaving behind them the big barracks and the Hotel de Ville, and feeling\\nmuch more interest in the Cite which appeared across the river, pent\\nbetween lofty smooth embankments rising from the water. Above the\\ndarkened houses rose the towers of Notre-Dame, as resplendent as if they\\nhad been newly gilt. Then the second-hand bookstalls began to invade\\nthe quays. Down below a lighter full of charcoal struggled against the\\nstrong current beneath an arch of the Pont Notre-Dame. And then, on\\nthe days when the flower market was held, they stopped, despite the\\ninclement weather, to inhale the scent of the first violets and the\\nearly gillyflowers. On their left a long stretch of bank now became\\nvisible; beyond the pepper-caster turrets of the Palais de Justice, the\\nsmall, murky tenements of the Quai de lâ\\x80\\x99Horloge showed as far as the\\nclump of trees midway across the Pont-Neuf; then, as they went farther\\non, other quays emerged from the mist, in the far distance: the Quai\\nVoltaire, the Quai Malaquais, the dome of the Institute of France, the\\nsquare pile of the Mint, a long grey line of frontages of which they\\ncould not even distinguish the windows, a promontory of roofs, which,\\nwith their stacks of chimney-pots, looked like some rugged cliff,\\ndipping down into a phosphorescent sea. In front, however, the Pavillon\\nde Flore lost its dreamy aspect, and became solidified in the final sun\\nblaze. Then right and left, on either bank of the river, came the long\\nvistas of the Boulevard de Sebastopol and the Boulevard du Palais;\\nthe handsome new buildings of the Quai de la Megisserie, with the new\\nPrefecture of Police across the water; and the old Pont-Neuf, with\\nits statue of Henri IV. looking like a splash of ink. The Louvre, the\\nTuileries followed, and beyond Grenelle there was a far-stretching\\npanorama of the slopes of Sevres, the country steeped in a stream of\\nsun rays. Claude never went farther. Christine always made him stop just\\nbefore they reached the Pont Royal, near the fine trees beside Vigierâ\\x80\\x99s\\nswimming baths; and when they turned round to shake hands once more in\\nthe golden sunset now flushing into crimson, they looked back and, on\\nthe horizon, espied the Isle Saint Louis, whence they had come, the\\nindistinct distance of the city upon which night was already descending\\nfrom the slate-hued eastern sky.\\n\\nAh! what splendid sunsets they beheld during those weekly strolls.\\nThe sun accompanied them, as it were, amid the throbbing gaiety of the\\nquays, the river life, the dancing ripples of the currents; amid the\\nattractions of the shops, as warm as conservatories, the flowers sold by\\nthe seed merchants, and the noisy cages of the bird fanciers; amid all\\nthe din of sound and wealth of colour which ever make a cityâ\\x80\\x99s waterside\\nits youthful part. As they proceeded, the ardent blaze of the western\\nsky turned to purple on their left, above the dark line of houses, and\\nthe orb of day seemed to wait for them, falling gradually lower, slowly\\nrolling towards the distant roofs when once they had passed the Pont\\nNotre-Dame in front of the widening stream. In no ancient forest, on no\\nmountain road, beyond no grassy plain will there ever be such triumphal\\nsunsets as behind the cupola of the Institute. It is there one sees\\nParis retiring to rest in all her glory. At each of their walks the\\naspect of the conflagration changed; fresh furnaces added their glow to\\nthe crown of flames. One evening, when a shower had surprised them, the\\nsun, showing behind the downpour, lit up the whole rain cloud, and upon\\ntheir heads there fell a spray of glowing water, irisated with pink\\nand azure. On the days when the sky was clear, however, the sun, like a\\nfiery ball, descended majestically in an unruffled sapphire lake; for a\\nmoment the black cupola of the Institute seemed to cut away part of it\\nand make it look like the waning moon; then the globe assumed a violet\\ntinge and at last became submerged in the lake, which had turned\\nblood-red. Already, in February, the planet described a wider curve, and\\nfell straight into the Seine, which seemed to seethe on the horizon as\\nat the contact of red-hot iron. However, the grander scenes, the vast\\nfairy pictures of space only blazed on cloudy evenings. Then, according\\nto the whim of the wind, there were seas of sulphur splashing against\\ncoral reefs; there were palaces and towers, marvels of architecture,\\npiled upon one another, burning and crumbling, and throwing torrents of\\nlava from their many gaps; or else the orb which had disappeared, hidden\\nby a veil of clouds, suddenly transpierced that veil with such a press\\nof light that shafts of sparks shot forth from one horizon to the other,\\nshowing as plainly as a volley of golden arrows. And then the twilight\\nfell, and they said good-bye to each other, while their eyes were still\\nfull of the final dazzlement. They felt that triumphal Paris was the\\naccomplice of the joy which they could not exhaust, the joy of ever\\nresuming together that walk beside the old stone parapets.\\n\\nOne day, however, there happened what Claude had always secretly feared.\\nChristine no longer seemed to believe in the possibility of meeting\\nanybody who knew her. In fact, was there such a person? She would always\\npass along like this, remaining altogether unknown. He, however, thought\\nof his own friends, and at times felt a kind of tremor when he fancied\\nhe recognised in the distance the back of some acquaintance. He was\\ntroubled by a feeling of delicacy; the idea that somebody might stare at\\nthe girl, approach them, and perhaps begin to joke, gave him intolerable\\nworry. And that very evening, as she was close beside him on his arm,\\nand they were approaching the Pont des Arts, he fell upon Sandoz and\\nDubuche, who were coming down the steps of the bridge. It was impossible\\nto avoid them, they were almost face to face; besides, his friends must\\nhave seen him, for they smiled. Claude, very pale, kept advancing, and\\nhe thought it all up on seeing Dubuche take a step towards him; but\\nSandoz was already holding the architect back, and leading him away.\\nThey passed on with an indifferent air and disappeared into the\\ncourtyard of the Louvre without as much as turning round. They had both\\njust recognised the original of the crayon sketch, which the painter hid\\naway with all the jealousy of a lover. Christine, who was chattering,\\nhad noticed nothing. Claude, with his heart throbbing, answered her in\\nmonosyllables, moved to tears, brimming over with gratitude to his old\\nchums for their discreet behaviour.\\n\\nA few days later, however, he had another shock. He did not expect\\nChristine, and had therefore made an appointment with Sandoz. Then,\\nas she had run up to spend an hour--it was one of those surprises that\\ndelighted them--they had just withdrawn the key, as usual, when\\nthere came a familiar knock with the fist on the door. Claude at once\\nrecognised the rap, and felt so upset at the mishap that he overturned a\\nchair. After that it was impossible to pretend to be out. But Christine\\nturned so pale, and implored him with such a wild gesture, that he\\nremained rooted to the spot, holding his breath. The knocks continued,\\nand a voice called, â\\x80\\x98Claude, Claude!â\\x80\\x99 He still remained quite still,\\ndebating with himself, however, with ashen lips and downcast eyes. Deep\\nsilence reigned, and then footsteps were heard, making the stairs creak\\nas they went down. Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s breast heaved with intense sadness; he felt\\nit bursting with remorse at the sound of each retreating step, as if he\\nhad denied the friendship of his whole youth.\\n\\nHowever, one afternoon there came another knock, and Claude had only\\njust time to whisper despairingly, â\\x80\\x98The key has been left in the door.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, Christine had forgotten to take it out. She became quite scared\\nand darted behind the screen, with her handkerchief over her mouth to\\nstifle the sound of her breathing.\\n\\nThe knocks became louder, there was a burst of laughter, and the painter\\nhad to reply, â\\x80\\x98Come in.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe felt more uncomfortable still when he saw Jory, who gallantly ushered\\nin Irma Becot, whose acquaintance he had made through Fagerolles, and\\nwho was flinging her youth about the Paris studios.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98She insisted upon seeing your studio, so I brought her,â\\x80\\x99 explained the\\njournalist.\\n\\nThe girl, however, without waiting, was already walking about and making\\nremarks, with perfect freedom of manner. â\\x80\\x98Oh! how funny it is here. And\\nwhat funny painting. Come, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a good fellow, show me everything. I\\nwant to see everything.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, apprehensively anxious, was afraid that she might push the\\nscreen aside. He pictured Christine behind it, and felt distracted\\nalready at what she might hear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You know what she has come to ask of you?â\\x80\\x99 resumed Jory cheerfully.\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember? You promised that she might pose for\\nsomething. And sheâ\\x80\\x99ll do so if you like.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Of course I will,â\\x80\\x99 said Irma.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The fact is,â\\x80\\x99 replied Claude, in an embarrassed tone, â\\x80\\x98my picture here\\nwill take up all my time till the Salon. I have a figure in it that\\ngives me a deal of trouble. Itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to perfect it with those\\nconfounded models.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIrma had stationed herself in front of the picture, and looked at it\\nwith a knowing air. â\\x80\\x98Oh! I see,â\\x80\\x99 she said, â\\x80\\x98that woman in the grass, eh?\\nDo you think I could be of any use to you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory flared up in a moment, warmly approving the idea, but Claude with\\nthe greatest energy replied, â\\x80\\x98No, no madame wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t suit. She is not at\\nall what I want for this picture; not at all.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen he went on stammering excuses. He would be only too pleased later\\non, but just now he was afraid that another model would quite complete\\nhis confusion over that picture; and Irma responded by shrugging her\\nshoulders, and looking at him with an air of smiling contempt.\\n\\nJory, however, now began to chat about their friends. Why had not\\nClaude come to Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s on the previous Thursday? One never saw him now.\\nDubuche asserted all sorts of things about him. There had been a row\\nbetween Fagerolles and Mahoudeau on the subject whether evening dress\\nwas a thing to be reproduced in sculpture. Then on the previous Sunday\\nGagniere had returned home from a Wagner concert with a black eye. He,\\nJory, had nearly had a duel at the Cafe Baudequin on account of one of\\nhis last articles in â\\x80\\x98The Drummer.â\\x80\\x99 The fact was he was giving it hot to\\nthe twopenny-halfpenny painters, the men with the usurped reputations!\\nThe campaign against the hanging committee of the Salon was making a\\ndeuce of a row; not a shred would be left of those guardians of the\\nideal, who wanted to prevent nature from entering their show.\\n\\nClaude listened to him with impatient irritation. He had taken up his\\npalette and was shuffling about in front of his picture. The other one\\nunderstood at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You want to work, I see; all right, weâ\\x80\\x99ll leave you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIrma, however, still stared at the painter, with her vague smile,\\nastonished at the stupidity of this simpleton, who did not seem to\\nappreciate her, and seized despite herself with a whim to please him.\\nHis studio was ugly, and he himself wasnâ\\x80\\x99t handsome; but why should he\\nput on such bugbear airs? She chaffed him for a moment, and on going off\\nagain offered to sit for him, emphasising her offer by warmly pressing\\nhis hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whenever you like,â\\x80\\x99 were her parting words.\\n\\nThey had gone at last, and Claude was obliged to pull the screen aside,\\nfor Christine, looking very white, remained seated behind it, as if she\\nlacked the strength to rise. She did not say a word about the girl, but\\nsimply declared that she had felt very frightened; and--trembling lest\\nthere should come another knock--she wanted to go at once, carrying away\\nwith her, as her startled looks testified, the disturbing thought of\\nmany things which she did not mention.\\n\\nIn fact, for a long time that sphere of brutal art, that studio full of\\nglaring pictures, had caused her a feeling of discomfort. Wounded in all\\nher feelings, full of repugnance, she could not get used to it all. She\\nhad grown up full of affectionate admiration for a very different style\\nof art--her motherâ\\x80\\x99s fine water-colours, those fans of dreamy delicacy,\\nin which lilac-tinted couples floated about in bluish gardens--and she\\nquite failed to understand Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s work. Even now she often amused\\nherself by painting tiny girlish landscapes, two or three subjects\\nrepeated over and over again--a lake with a ruin, a water-mill beating\\na stream, a chalet and some pine trees, white with snow. And she felt\\nsurprised that an intelligent young fellow should paint in such an\\nunreasonable manner, so ugly and so untruthful besides. For she not\\nonly thought Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s realism monstrously ugly, but considered it beyond\\nevery permissible truth. In fact, she thought at times that he must be\\nmad.\\n\\nOne day Claude absolutely insisted upon seeing a small sketch-book which\\nshe had brought away from Clermont, and which she had spoken about.\\nAfter objecting for a long while, she brought it with her, flattered at\\nheart and feeling very curious to know what he would say. He turned over\\nthe leaves, smiling all the while, and as he did not speak, she was the\\nfirst to ask:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You think it very bad, donâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not at all,â\\x80\\x99 he replied. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s innocent.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe reply hurt her, despite Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s indulgent tone, which aimed at\\nmaking it amiable.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, you see I had so few lessons from mamma. I like painting to be\\nwell done, and pleasing.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon he burst into frank laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Confess now that my painting makes you feel ill! I have noticed it. You\\npurse your lips and open your eyes wide with fright. Certainly it is\\nnot the style of painting for ladies, least of all for young girls. But\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll get used to it; itâ\\x80\\x99s only a question of educating your eyes and\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll end by seeing that what I am doing is very honest and healthy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIndeed, Christine slowly became used to it. But, at first, artistic\\nconviction had nothing to do with the change, especially as Claude,\\nwith his contempt for female opinion, did not take the trouble to\\nindoctrinate her. On the contrary, in her company he avoided conversing\\nabout art, as if he wished to retain for himself that passion of his\\nlife, apart from the new passion which was gradually taking possession\\nof him. Still, Christine glided into the habit of the thing, and became\\nfamiliarised with it; she began to feel interested in those abominable\\npictures, on noticing the important place they held in the artistâ\\x80\\x99s\\nexistence. This was the first stage on the road to conversion; she\\nfelt greatly moved by his rageful eagerness to be up and doing, the\\nwhole-heartedness with which he devoted himself to his work. Was it not\\nvery touching? Was there not something very creditable in it? Then, on\\nnoticing his joy or suffering, according to the success or the failure\\nof the dayâ\\x80\\x99s work, she began to associate herself with his efforts. She\\nfelt saddened when she found him sad, she grew cheerful when he received\\nher cheerfully; and from that moment her worry was--had he done a lot\\nof work? was he satisfied with what he had done since they had last seen\\neach other? At the end of the second month she had been gained over;\\nshe stationed herself before his pictures to judge whether they were\\nprogressing or not. She no longer felt afraid of them. She still did not\\napprove particularly of that style of painting, but she began to repeat\\nthe artistic expressions which she had heard him use; declared this\\nbit to be â\\x80\\x98vigorous in tone,â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98well built up,â\\x80\\x99 or â\\x80\\x98just in the light\\nit should be.â\\x80\\x99 He seemed to her so good-natured, and she was so fond of\\nhim, that after finding excuses for him for daubing those horrors, she\\nended by discovering qualities in them in order that she might like them\\na little also.\\n\\nNevertheless, there was one picture, the large one, the one intended for\\nthe Salon, to which for a long while she was quite unable to reconcile\\nherself. She already looked without dislike at the studies made at the\\nBoutin studio and the sketches of Plassans, but she was still irritated\\nby the sight of the woman lying in the grass. It was like a personal\\ngrudge, the shame of having momentarily thought that she could detect\\nin it a likeness of herself, and silent embarrassment, too, for that big\\nfigure continued to wound her feelings, although she now found less and\\nless of a resemblance in it. At first she had protested by averting her\\neyes. Now she remained for several minutes looking at it fixedly,\\nin mute contemplation. How was it that the likeness to herself had\\ndisappeared? The more vigorously that Claude struggled on, never\\nsatisfied, touching up the same bit a hundred times over, the more did\\nthat likeness to herself gradually fade away. And, without being able\\nto account for it, without daring to admit as much to herself, she, whom\\nthe painting had so greatly offended when she had first seen it, now\\nfelt a growing sorrow at noticing that nothing of herself remained.\\n\\nIndeed it seemed to her as if their friendship suffered from this\\nobliteration; she felt herself further away from him as trait after\\ntrait vanished. Didnâ\\x80\\x99t he care for her that he thus allowed her to be\\neffaced from his work? And who was the new woman, whose was the unknown\\nindistinct face that appeared from beneath hers?\\n\\nClaude, in despair at having spoilt the figureâ\\x80\\x99s head, did not know\\nexactly how to ask her for a few hoursâ\\x80\\x99 sitting. She would merely have\\nhad to sit down, and he would only have taken some hints. But he had\\npreviously seen her so pained that he felt afraid of irritating her\\nagain. Moreover, after resolving in his own mind to ask her this favour\\nin a gay, off-hand way, he had been at a loss for words, feeling all at\\nonce ashamed at the notion.\\n\\nOne afternoon he quite upset her by one of those bursts of anger which\\nhe found it impossible to control, even in her presence. Everything had\\ngone wrong that week; he talked of scraping his canvas again, and he\\npaced up and down, beside himself, and kicking the furniture about. Then\\nall of a sudden he caught her by the shoulders, and made her sit down on\\nthe couch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I beg of you, do me this favour, or itâ\\x80\\x99ll kill me, I swear it will.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe did not understand him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What--what is it you want?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen as soon as she saw him take up his brushes, she added, without\\nheeding what she said, â\\x80\\x98Ah, yes! Why did not you ask me before?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd of her own accord she threw herself back on a cushion and slipped\\nher arm under her neck. But surprise and confusion at having yielded so\\nquickly made her grave, for she did not know that she was prepared for\\nthis kind of thing; indeed, she could have sworn that she would never\\nserve him as a model again. Her compliance already filled her with\\nremorse, as if she were lending herself to something wrong by letting\\nhim impart her own countenance to that big creature, lying refulgent\\nunder the sun.\\n\\nHowever, in two sittings, Claude worked in the head all right. He\\nexulted with delight, and exclaimed that it was the best bit of painting\\nhe had ever done; and he was right, never had he thrown such a play of\\nreal light over such a life-like face. Happy at seeing him so pleased,\\nChristine also became gay, going as far as to express approval of her\\nhead, which, though not extremely like her, had a wonderful expression.\\nThey stood for a long while before the picture, blinking at it, and\\ndrawing back as far as the wall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And now,â\\x80\\x99 he said at last, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll finish her off with a model. Ah! so\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve got her at last.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn a burst of childish glee, he took the girl round the waist, and they\\nperformed â\\x80\\x98a triumphant war dance,â\\x80\\x99 as he called it. She laughed very\\nheartily, fond of romping as she was, and no longer feeling aught of her\\nscruples and discomfort.\\n\\nBut the very next week Claude became gloomy again. He had chosen Zoe\\nPiedefer as a model, but she did not satisfy him. Christineâ\\x80\\x99s delicate\\nhead, as he expressed it, did not set well on the otherâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders. He,\\nnevertheless, persisted, scratched out, began anew, and worked so\\nhard that he lived in a constant state of fever. Towards the middle of\\nJanuary, seized with despair, he abandoned his picture and turned it\\nagainst the wall, swearing that he would not finish it. But a fortnight\\nlater, he began to work at it again with another model, and then found\\nhimself obliged to change the whole tone of it. Thus matters got still\\nworse; so he sent for Zoe again; became altogether at sea, and quite ill\\nwith uncertainty and anguish. And the pity of it was, that the central\\nfigure alone worried him, for he was well satisfied with the rest of\\nthe painting, the trees of the background, the two little women and the\\ngentleman in the velvet coat, all finished and vigorous. February was\\ndrawing to a close; he had only a few days left to send his picture to\\nthe Salon; it was quite a disaster.\\n\\nOne evening, in Christineâ\\x80\\x99s presence, he began swearing, and all at once\\na cry of fury escaped him: â\\x80\\x98After all, by the thunder of heaven, is it\\npossible to stick one womanâ\\x80\\x99s head on anotherâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders? I ought to\\nchop my hand off.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFrom the depths of his heart a single idea now rose to his brain: to\\nobtain her consent to pose for the whole figure. It had slowly sprouted,\\nfirst as a simple wish, quickly discarded as absurd; then had come a\\nsilent, constantly-renewed debate with himself; and at last, under the\\nspur of necessity, keen and definite desire. The recollection of the\\nmorning after the storm, when she had accepted his hospitality, haunted\\nand tortured him. It was she whom he needed; she alone could enable\\nhim to realise his dream, and he beheld her again in all her youthful\\nfreshness, beaming and indispensable. If he could not get her to pose,\\nhe might as well give up his picture, for no one else would ever satisfy\\nhim. At times, while he remained seated for hours, distracted in front\\nof the unfinished canvas, so utterly powerless that he no longer knew\\nwhere to give a stroke of the brush, he formed heroic resolutions. The\\nmoment she came in he would throw himself at her feet; he would tell her\\nof his distress in such touching words that she would perhaps consent.\\nBut as soon as he beheld her, he lost all courage, he averted his eyes,\\nlest she might decipher his thoughts in his instinctive glances. Such\\na request would be madness. One could not expect such a service from a\\nfriend; he would never have the audacity to ask.\\n\\nNevertheless, one evening as he was getting ready to accompany her, and\\nas she was putting on her bonnet, with her arms uplifted, they remained\\nfor a moment looking into each otherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, he quivering, and she\\nsuddenly becoming so grave, so pale, that he felt himself detected. All\\nalong the quays they scarcely spoke; the matter remained unmentioned\\nbetween them while the sun set in the coppery sky. Twice afterwards he\\nagain read in her looks that she was aware of his all-absorbing thought.\\nIn fact, since he had dreamt about it, she had began to do the same,\\nin spite of herself, her attention roused by his involuntary allusions.\\nThey scarcely affected her at first, though she was obliged at last to\\nnotice them; still the question seemed to her to be beyond the range\\nof possibility, to be one of those unavowable ideas which people do not\\neven speak of. The fear that he would dare to ask her did not even occur\\nto her; she knew him well by now; she could have silenced him with a\\ngesture, before he had stammered the first words, and in spite of his\\nsudden bursts of anger. It was simple madness. Never, never!\\n\\nDays went by, and between them that fixed idea grew in intensity. The\\nmoment they were together they could not help thinking of it. Not a word\\nwas spoken on the subject, but their very silence was eloquent; they no\\nlonger made a movement, no longer exchanged a smile without stumbling\\nupon that thought, which they found impossible to put into words, though\\nit filled their minds. Soon nothing but that remained in their fraternal\\nintercourse. And the perturbation of heart and senses which they had\\nso far avoided in the course of their familiar intimacy, came at last,\\nunder the influence of the all-besetting thought. And then the anguish\\nwhich they left unmentioned, but which they could not hide from one\\nanother, racked and stifled them, left them heaving distressfully with\\npainful sighs.\\n\\nTowards the middle of March, Christine, at one of her visits, found\\nClaude seated before his picture, overcome with sorrow. He had not\\neven heard her enter. He remained motionless, with vacant, haggard eyes\\nstaring at his unfinished work. In another three days the delay for\\nsending in exhibits for the Salon would expire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 she inquired gently, after standing for a long time behind him,\\ngrief-stricken at seeing him in such despair.\\n\\nHe started and turned round.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, itâ\\x80\\x99s all up. I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t exhibit anything this year. Ah! I who\\nrelied so much upon this Salon!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBoth relapsed into despondency--a despondency and agitation full of\\nconfused thoughts. Then she resumed, thinking aloud as it were:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There would still be time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Time? Oh! no indeed. A miracle would be needed. Where am I to find a\\nmodel so late in the day? Do you know, since this morning I have been\\nworrying, and for a moment I thought I had hit upon an idea: Yes, it\\nwould be to go and fetch that girl, that Irma who came while you were\\nhere. I know well enough that she is short and not at all such as I\\nthought of, and so I should perhaps have to change everything once more;\\nbut all the same it might be possible to make her do. Decidedly, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\ntry her--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe stopped short. The glowing eyes with which he gazed at her clearly\\nsaid: â\\x80\\x98Ah! thereâ\\x80\\x99s you! ah! it would be the hoped-for miracle, and\\ntriumph would be certain, if you were to make this supreme sacrifice\\nfor me. I beseech you, I ask you devoutly, as a friend, the dearest, the\\nmost beauteous, the most pure.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe, erect, looking very pale, seemed to hear each of those words,\\nthough all remained unspoken, and his ardently beseeching eyes overcame\\nher. She herself did not speak. She simply did as she was desired,\\nacting almost like one in a dream. Beneath it all there lurked the\\nthought that he must not ask elsewhere, for she was now conscious of\\nher earlier jealous disquietude and wished to share his affections with\\nnone. Yet it was in silence and all chastity that she stretched herself\\non the couch, and took up the pose, with one arm under her head, her\\neyes closed.\\n\\nAnd Claude? Startled, full of gratitude, he had at last found again the\\nsudden vision that he had so often evoked. But he himself did not speak;\\nhe began to paint in the deep solemn silence that had fallen upon them\\nboth. For two long hours he stood to his work with such manly energy\\nthat he finished right off a superb roughing out of the whole figure.\\nNever before had he felt such enthusiasm in his art. It seemed to him\\nas if he were in the presence of some saint; and at times he wondered\\nat the transfiguration of Christineâ\\x80\\x99s face, whose somewhat massive jaws\\nseemed to have receded beneath the gentle placidity which her brow and\\ncheeks displayed. During those two hours she did not stir, she did not\\nspeak, but from time to time she opened her clear eyes, fixing them on\\nsome vague, distant point, and remaining thus for a moment, then closing\\nthem again, and relapsing into the lifelessness of fine marble, with the\\nmysterious fixed smile required by the pose.\\n\\nIt was by a gesture that Claude apprized her he had finished. He turned\\naway, and when they stood face to face again, she ready to depart, they\\ngazed at one another, overcome by emotion which still prevented them\\nfrom speaking. Was it sadness, then, unconscious, unnameable sadness?\\nFor their eyes filled with tears, as if they had just spoilt their lives\\nand dived to the depths of human misery. Then, moved and grieved, unable\\nto find a word, even of thanks, he kissed her religiously upon the brow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nON the 15th May, a Friday, Claude, who had returned at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in\\nthe morning from Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s, was still asleep at nine, when Madame Joseph\\nbrought him up a large bouquet of white lilac which a commissionaire had\\njust left downstairs. He understood at once. Christine had wished to be\\nbeforehand in celebrating the success of his painting. For this was a\\ngreat day for him, the opening day of the â\\x80\\x98Salon of the Rejected,â\\x80\\x99 which\\nwas first instituted that year,* and at which his picture--refused by\\nthe hanging committee of the official Salon--was to be exhibited.\\n\\n  * This was in 1863.--ED.\\n\\nThat delicate attention on Christineâ\\x80\\x99s part, that fresh and fragrant\\nlilac, affected him greatly, as if presaging a happy day. Still in his\\nnightshirt, with his feet bare, he placed the flowers in his water-jug\\non the table. Then, with his eyes still swollen with sleep, almost\\nbewildered, he dressed, scolding himself the while for having slept so\\nlong. On the previous night he had promised Dubuche and Sandoz to call\\nfor them at the latterâ\\x80\\x99s place at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, in order that they\\nmight all three go together to the Palais de lâ\\x80\\x99Industrie, where they\\nwould find the rest of the band. And he was already an hour behind time.\\n\\nThen, as luck would have it, he could not lay his hands upon anything in\\nhis studio, which had been turned topsy-turvy since the despatch of the\\nbig picture. For more than five minutes he hunted on his knees for his\\nshoes, among a quantity of old chases. Some particles of gold leaf flew\\nabout, for, not knowing where to get the money for a proper frame, he\\nhad employed a joiner of the neighbourhood to fit four strips of board\\ntogether, and had gilded them himself, with the assistance of his friend\\nChristine, who, by the way, had proved a very unskilful gilder. At last,\\ndressed and shod, and having his soft felt hat bespangled with yellow\\nsparks of the gold, he was about to go, when a superstitious thought\\nbrought him back to the nosegay, which had remained alone on the centre\\nof the table. If he did not kiss the lilac he was sure to suffer an\\naffront. So he kissed it and felt perfumed by its strong springtide\\naroma.\\n\\nUnder the archway, he gave his key as usual to the doorkeeper. â\\x80\\x98Madame\\nJoseph,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98I shall not be home all day.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn less than twenty minutes he was in the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Enfer, at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s. But\\nthe latter, whom he feared would have already gone, was equally late in\\nconsequence of a sudden indisposition which had come upon his mother. It\\nwas nothing serious. She had merely passed a bad night, but it had for a\\nwhile quite upset him with anxiety. Now, easy in mind again, Sandoz told\\nClaude that Dubuche had written saying that they were not to wait for\\nhim, and giving an appointment at the Palais. They therefore started\\noff, and as it was nearly eleven, they decided to lunch in a deserted\\nlittle _cremerie_ in the Rue St. Honore, which they did very leisurely,\\nseized with laziness amidst all their ardent desire to see and know;\\nand enjoying, as it were, a kind of sweet, tender sadness from lingering\\nawhile and recalling memories of their youth.\\n\\nOne oâ\\x80\\x99clock was striking when they crossed the Champs Elysees. It was\\na lovely day, with a limpid sky, to which the breeze, still somewhat\\nchilly, seemed to impart a brighter azure. Beneath the sun, of the\\nhue of ripe corn, the rows of chestnut trees showed new foliage of a\\ndelicate and seemingly freshly varnished green; and the fountains with\\ntheir leaping sheafs of water, the well-kept lawns, the deep vistas of\\nthe pathways, and the broad open spaces, all lent an air of luxurious\\ngrandeur to the panorama. A few carriages, very few at that early\\nhour, were ascending the avenue, while a stream of bewildered, bustling\\npeople, suggesting a swarm of ants, plunged into the huge archway of the\\nPalais de lâ\\x80\\x99Industrie.\\n\\nWhen they were inside, Claude shivered slightly while crossing the\\ngigantic vestibule, which was as cold as a cellar, with a damp pavement\\nwhich resounded beneath oneâ\\x80\\x99s feet, like the flagstones of a church.\\nHe glanced right and left at the two monumental stairways, and asked\\ncontemptuously: â\\x80\\x98I say, are we going through their dirty Salon?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! no, dash it!â\\x80\\x99 answered Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s cut through the garden. The\\nwestern staircase over there leads to â\\x80\\x9cthe Rejected.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen they passed disdainfully between the two little tables of the\\ncatalogue vendors. Between the huge red velvet curtains and beyond a\\nshady porch appeared the garden, roofed in with glass. At that time of\\nday it was almost deserted; there were only some people at the buffet\\nunder the clock, a throng of people lunching. The crowd was in the\\ngalleries on the first floor, and the white statues alone edged the\\nyellow-sanded pathways which with stretches of crude colour intersected\\nthe green lawns. There was a whole nation of motionless marble there\\nsteeped in the diffuse light falling from the glazed roof on high.\\nLooking southwards, some holland screens barred half of the nave, which\\nshowed ambery in the sunlight and was speckled at both ends by the\\ndazzling blue and crimson of stained-glass windows. Just a few visitors,\\ntired already, occupied the brand-new chairs and seats, shiny with fresh\\npaint; while the flights of sparrows, who dwelt above, among the iron\\ngirders, swooped down, quite at home, raking up the sand and twittering\\nas they pursued each other.\\n\\nClaude and Sandoz made a show of walking very quickly without giving\\na glance around them. A stiff classical bronze statue, a Minerva by a\\nmember of the Institute, had exasperated them at the very door. But as\\nthey hastened past a seemingly endless line of busts, they recognised\\nBongrand, who, all alone, was going slowly round a colossal,\\noverflowing, recumbent figure, which had been placed in the middle of\\nthe path. With his hands behind his back, quite absorbed, he bent his\\nwrinkled face every now and then over the plaster.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, itâ\\x80\\x99s you?â\\x80\\x99 he said, as they held out their hands to him. â\\x80\\x98I was\\njust looking at our friend Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s figure, which they have at least\\nhad the intelligence to admit, and to put in a good position.â\\x80\\x99 Then,\\nbreaking off: â\\x80\\x98Have you been upstairs?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, we have just come in,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude.\\n\\nThereupon Bongrand began to talk warmly about the Salon of the Rejected.\\nHe, who belonged to the Institute, but who lived apart from his\\ncolleagues, made very merry over the affair; the everlasting discontent\\nof painters; the campaign conducted by petty newspapers like â\\x80\\x98The\\nDrummerâ\\x80\\x99; the protestations, the constant complaints that had at last\\ndisturbed the Emperor, and the artistic _coup dâ\\x80\\x99etat_ carried out by\\nthat silent dreamer, for this Salon of the Rejected was entirely his\\nwork. Then the great painter alluded to all the hubbub caused by the\\nflinging of such a paving-stone into that frogâ\\x80\\x99s pond, the official art\\nworld.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 he continued, â\\x80\\x98you can have no idea of the rage and indignation\\namong the members of the hanging committee. And remember Iâ\\x80\\x99m distrusted,\\nthey generally keep quiet when Iâ\\x80\\x99m there. But they are all furious with\\nthe realists. It was to them that they systematically closed the doors\\nof the temple; it is on account of them that the Emperor has allowed the\\npublic to revise their verdict; and finally it is they, the realists,\\nwho triumph. Ah! I hear some nice things said; I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t give a high\\nprice for your skins, youngsters.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe laughed his big, joyous laugh, stretching out his arms the while as\\nif to embrace all the youthfulness that he divined rising around him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your disciples are growing,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, simply.\\n\\nBut Bongrand, becoming embarrassed, silenced him with a wave of\\nhis hand. He himself had not sent anything for exhibition, and the\\nprodigious mass of work amidst which he found himself--those pictures,\\nthose statues, all those proofs of creative effort--filled him with\\nregret. It was not jealousy, for there lived not a more upright and\\nbetter soul; but as a result of self-examination, a gnawing fear of\\nimpotence, an unavowed dread haunted him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And at â\\x80\\x9cthe Rejected,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz; â\\x80\\x98how goes it there?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Superb; youâ\\x80\\x99ll see.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen turning towards Claude, and keeping both the young manâ\\x80\\x99s hands in\\nhis own, â\\x80\\x98You, my good fellow, you are a trump. Listen! they say I am\\nclever: well, Iâ\\x80\\x99d give ten years of my life to have painted that big\\nhussy of yours.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nPraise like that, coming from such lips, moved the young painter to\\ntears. Victory had come at last, then? He failed to find a word of\\nthanks, and abruptly changed the conversation, wishing to hide his\\nemotion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That good fellow Mahoudeau!â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98why his figureâ\\x80\\x99s capital! He has\\na deuced fine temperament, hasnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz and Claude had begun to walk round the plaster figure. Bongrand\\nreplied with a smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes; thereâ\\x80\\x99s too much fulness and massiveness in parts. But just\\nlook at the articulations, they are delicate and really pretty. Come,\\ngood-bye, I must leave you. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to sit down a while. My legs are\\nbending under me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude had raised his head to listen. A tremendous uproar, an incessant\\ncrashing that had not struck him at first, careered through the air; it\\nwas like the din of a tempest beating against a cliff, the rumbling of\\nan untiring assault, dashing forward from endless space.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallow, whatâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x99 he muttered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That,â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand, as he walked away, â\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s the crowd upstairs in\\nthe galleries.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd the two young fellows, having crossed the garden, then went up to\\nthe Salon of the Rejected.\\n\\nIt had been installed in first-rate style. The officially received\\npictures were not lodged more sumptuously: lofty hangings of old\\ntapestry at the doors; â\\x80\\x98the lineâ\\x80\\x99 set off with green baize; seats of\\ncrimson velvet; white linen screens under the large skylights of the\\nroof. And all along the suite of galleries the first impression was the\\nsame--there were the same gilt frames, the same bright colours on the\\ncanvases. But there was a special kind of cheerfulness, a sparkle of\\nyouth which one did not altogether realise at first. The crowd, already\\ncompact, increased every minute, for the official Salon was being\\ndeserted. People came stung by curiosity, impelled by a desire to judge\\nthe judges, and, above all, full of the conviction that they were going\\nto see some very diverting things. It was very hot; a fine dust arose\\nfrom the flooring; and certainly, towards four oâ\\x80\\x99clock people would\\nstifle there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hang it!â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, trying to elbow his way, â\\x80\\x98it will be no easy job\\nto move about and find your picture.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nA burst of fraternal feverishness made him eager to get to it. That day\\nhe only lived for the work and glory of his old chum.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t worry!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude; â\\x80\\x98we shall get to it all right. My\\npicture wonâ\\x80\\x99t fly off.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he affected to be in no hurry, in spite of the almost irresistible\\ndesire that he felt to run. He raised his head and looked around him;\\nand soon, amidst the loud voices of the crowd that had bewildered him,\\nhe distinguished some restrained laughter, which was almost drowned\\nby the tramp of feet and the hubbub of conversation. Before certain\\npictures the public stood joking. This made him feel uneasy, for despite\\nall his revolutionary brutality he was as sensitive and as credulous\\nas a woman, and always looked forward to martyrdom, though he was ever\\ngrieved and stupefied at being repulsed and railed at.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They seem gay here,â\\x80\\x99 he muttered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, thereâ\\x80\\x99s good reason,â\\x80\\x99 remarked Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98Just look at those\\nextravagant jades!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt the same moment, while still lingering in the first gallery,\\nFagerolles ran up against them without seeing them. He started, being\\nno doubt annoyed by the meeting. However, he recovered his composure\\nimmediately, and behaved very amiably.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! I was just thinking of you. I have been here for the last hour.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where have they put Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s picture?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz. Fagerolles, who\\nhad just remained for twenty minutes in front of that picture studying\\nit and studying the impression which it produced on the public, answered\\nwithout wincing, â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know; I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been able to find it. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nlook for it together if you like.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he joined them. Terrible wag as he was, he no longer affected\\nlow-bred manners to the same degree as formerly; he already began to\\ndress well, and although with his mocking nature he was still disposed\\nto snap at everybody as of old, he pursed his lips into the serious\\nexpression of a fellow who wants to make his way in the world. With an\\nair of conviction he added: â\\x80\\x98I must say that I now regret not having\\nsent anything this year! I should be here with all the rest of you, and\\nhave my share of success. And there are really some astonishing things,\\nmy boys! those horses, for instance.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe pointed to a huge canvas in front of them, before which the crowd was\\ngathering and laughing. It was, so people said, the work of an erstwhile\\nveterinary surgeon, and showed a number of life-size horses in a meadow,\\nfantastic horses, blue, violet, and pink, whose astonishing anatomy\\ntranspierced their sides.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, donâ\\x80\\x99t you humbug us,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, suspiciously.\\n\\nBut Fagerolles pretended to be enthusiastic. â\\x80\\x98What do you mean? The\\npictureâ\\x80\\x99s full of talent. The fellow who painted it understands horses\\ndevilish well. No doubt he paints like a brute. But whatâ\\x80\\x99s the odds if\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s original, and contributes a document?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs he spoke Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 delicate girlish face remained perfectly grave,\\nand it was impossible to tell whether he was joking. There was but the\\nslightest yellow twinkle of spitefulness in the depths of his grey eyes.\\nAnd he finished with a sarcastic allusion, the drift of which was as yet\\npatent to him alone. â\\x80\\x98Ah, well! if you let yourself be influenced by the\\nfools who laugh, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have enough to do by and by.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe three friends had gone on again, only advancing, however, with\\ninfinite difficulty amid that sea of surging shoulders. On entering the\\nsecond gallery they gave a glance round the walls, but the picture they\\nsought was not there. In lieu thereof they perceived Irma Becot on\\nthe arm of Gagniere, both of them pressed against a hand-rail, he busy\\nexamining a small canvas, while she, delighted at being hustled about,\\nraised her pink little mug and laughed at the crowd.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo!â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, surprised, â\\x80\\x98here she is with Gagniere now!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, just a fancy of hers!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Fagerolles quietly. â\\x80\\x98She has a\\nvery swell place now. Yes, it was given her by that young idiot of a\\nmarquis, whom the papers are always talking about. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a girl whoâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nmake her way; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always said so! But she seems to retain a weakness\\nfor painters, and every now and then drops into the Cafe Baudequin to\\nlook up old friends!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIrma had now seen them, and was making gestures from afar. They could\\nbut go to her. When Gagniere, with his light hair and little beardless\\nface, turned round, looking more grotesque than over, he did not show\\nthe least surprise at finding them there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful,â\\x80\\x99 he muttered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful?â\\x80\\x99 asked Fagerolles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98This little masterpiece--and withal honest and naif, and full of\\nconviction.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe pointed to a tiny canvas before which he had stood absorbed, an\\nabsolutely childish picture, such as an urchin of four might have\\npainted; a little cottage at the edge of a little road, with a little\\ntree beside it, the whole out of drawing, and girt round with black\\nlines. Not even a corkscrew imitation of smoke issuing from the roof was\\nforgotten.\\n\\nClaude made a nervous gesture, while Fagerolles repeated phlegmatically:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very delicate, very delicate. But your picture, Gagniere, where is it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My picture, it is there.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, the picture he had sent happened to be very near the little\\nmasterpiece. It was a landscape of a pearly grey, a bit of the Seine\\nbanks, painted carefully, pretty in tone, though somewhat heavy, and\\nperfectly ponderated without a sign of any revolutionary splash.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98To think that they were idiotic enough to refuse that!â\\x80\\x99 said Claude,\\nwho had approached with an air of interest. But why, I ask you, why?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Because itâ\\x80\\x99s realistic,â\\x80\\x99 said Fagerolles, in so sharp a voice that one\\ncould not tell whether he was gibing at the jury or at the picture.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Irma, of whom no one took any notice, was looking fixedly at\\nClaude with the unconscious smile which the savage loutishness of that\\nbig fellow always brought to her lips. To think that he had not even\\ncared to see her again. She found him so much altered since the last\\ntime she had seen him, so funny, and not at all prepossessing, with his\\nhair standing on end, and his face wan and sallow, as if he had had a\\nsevere fever. Pained that he did not seem to notice her, she wanted to\\nattract his attention, and touched his arm with a familiar gesture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, isnâ\\x80\\x99t that one of your friends over there, looking for you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was Dubuche, whom she knew from having seen him on one occasion at\\nthe Cafe Baudequin. He was, with difficulty, elbowing his way through\\nthe crowd, and staring vaguely at the sea of heads around him. But\\nall at once, when Claude was trying to attract his notice by dint of\\ngesticulations, the other turned his back to bow very low to a party of\\nthree--the father short and fat, with a sanguine face; the mother very\\nthin, of the colour of wax, and devoured by anemia; and the daughter\\nso physically backward at eighteen, that she retained all the lank\\nscragginess of childhood.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right!â\\x80\\x99 muttered the painter. â\\x80\\x98There heâ\\x80\\x99s caught now. What ugly\\nacquaintances the brute has! Where can he have fished up such horrors?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere quietly replied that he knew the strangers by sight. M.\\nMargaillan was a great masonry contractor, already a millionaire five or\\nsix times over, and was making his fortune out of the great public\\nworks of Paris, running up whole boulevards on his own account. No doubt\\nDubuche had become acquainted with him through one of the architects he\\nworked for.\\n\\nHowever, Sandoz, compassionating the scragginess of the girl, whom he\\nkept watching, judged her in one sentence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! the poor little flayed kitten. One feels sorry for her.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Let them alone!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, ferociously. â\\x80\\x98They have all the\\ncrimes of the middle classes stamped on their faces; they reek of\\nscrofula and idiocy. It serves them right. But hallo! our runaway friend\\nis making off with them. What grovellers architects are! Good riddance.\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99ll have to look for us when he wants us!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDubuche, who had not seen his friends, had just offered his arm to the\\nmother, and was going off, explaining the pictures with gestures typical\\nof exaggerated politeness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, letâ\\x80\\x99s proceed then,â\\x80\\x99 said Fagerolles; and, addressing Gagniere,\\nhe asked, â\\x80\\x98Do you know where they have put Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s picture?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I? no, I was looking for it--I am going with you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe accompanied them, forgetting Irma Becot against the â\\x80\\x98line.â\\x80\\x99 It was\\nshe who had wanted to visit the Salon on his arm, and he was so little\\nused to promenading a woman about, that he had constantly lost her on\\nthe way, and was each time stupefied to find her again beside him, no\\nlonger knowing how or why they were thus together. She ran after them,\\nand took his arm once more in order to follow Claude, who was already\\npassing into another gallery with Fagerolles and Sandoz.\\n\\nThen the five roamed about in Indian file, with their noses in the\\nair, now separated by a sudden crush, now reunited by another, and\\never carried along by the stream. An abomination of Chaineâ\\x80\\x99s, a â\\x80\\x98Christ\\npardoning the Woman taken in Adultery,â\\x80\\x99 made them pause; it was a group\\nof dry figures that looked as if cut out of wood, very bony of build,\\nand seemingly painted with mud. But close by they admired a very fine\\nstudy of a woman, seen from behind, with her head turned sideways. The\\nwhole show was a mixture of the best and the worst, all styles were\\nmingled together, the drivellers of the historical school elbowed the\\nyoung lunatics of realism, the pure simpletons were lumped together with\\nthose who bragged about their originality. A dead Jezabel, that seemed\\nto have rotted in the cellars of the School of Arts, was exhibited near\\na lady in white, the very curious conception of a future great artist*;\\nthen a huge shepherd looking at the sea, a weak production, faced a\\nlittle painting of some Spaniards playing at rackets, a dash of light\\nof splendid intensity. Nothing execrable was wanting, neither military\\nscenes full of little leaden soldiers, nor wan antiquity, nor the middle\\nages, smeared, as it were, with bitumen. But from amidst the incoherent\\nensemble, and especially from the landscapes, all of which were painted\\nin a sincere, correct key, and also from the portraits, most of which\\nwere very interesting in respect to workmanship, there came a good fresh\\nscent of youth, bravery and passion. If there were fewer bad pictures in\\nthe official Salon, the average there was assuredly more commonplace and\\nmediocre. Here one found the smell of battle, of cheerful battle, given\\njauntily at daybreak, when the bugle sounds, and when one marches to\\nmeet the enemy with the certainty of beating him before sunset.\\n\\n  * Edouard Manet.--ED.\\n\\nClaude, whose spirits had revived amidst that martial odour, grew\\nanimated and pugnacious as he listened to the laughter of the public. He\\nlooked as defiant, indeed, as if he had heard bullets whizzing past him.\\nSufficiently discreet at the entrance of the galleries, the laughter\\nbecame more boisterous, more unrestrained, as they advanced. In the\\nthird room the women ceased concealing their smiles behind their\\nhandkerchiefs, while the men openly held their sides the better to ease\\nthemselves. It was the contagious hilarity of people who had come to\\namuse themselves, and who were growing gradually excited, bursting out\\nat a mere trifle, diverted as much by the good things as by the bad.\\nFolks laughed less before Chaineâ\\x80\\x99s Christ than before the back view of\\nthe nude woman, who seemed to them very comical indeed. The â\\x80\\x98Lady in\\nWhiteâ\\x80\\x99 also stupefied people and drew them together; folks nudged each\\nother and went into hysterics almost; there was always a grinning group\\nin front of it. Each canvas thus had its particular kind of success;\\npeople hailed each other from a distance to point out something funny,\\nand witticisms flew from mouth to mouth; to such a degree indeed that,\\nas Claude entered the fourth gallery, lashed into fury by the tempest of\\nlaughter that was raging there as well, he all but slapped the face of\\nan old lady whose chuckles exasperated him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What idiots!â\\x80\\x99 he said, turning towards his friends. â\\x80\\x98One feels inclined\\nto throw a lot of masterpieces at their heads.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz had become fiery also, and Fagerolles continued praising the\\nmost dreadful daubs, which only tended to increase the laughter, while\\nGagniere, at sea amid the hubbub, dragged on the delighted Irma, whose\\nskirts somehow wound round the legs of all the men.\\n\\nBut of a sudden Jory stood before them. His fair handsome face\\nabsolutely beamed. He cut his way through the crowd, gesticulated, and\\nexulted, as if over a personal victory. And the moment he perceived\\nClaude, he shouted:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Here you are at last! I have been looking for you this hour. A success,\\nold fellow, oh! a success--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What success?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, the success of your picture. Come, I must show it you. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s stunning.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude grew pale. A great joy choked him, while he pretended to receive\\nthe news with composure. Bongrandâ\\x80\\x99s words came back to him. He began to\\nbelieve that he possessed genius.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, how are you?â\\x80\\x99 continued Jory, shaking hands with the others.\\n\\nAnd, without more ado, he, Fagerolles and Gagniere surrounded Irma, who\\nsmiled on them in a good-natured way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Perhaps youâ\\x80\\x99ll tell us where the picture is,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, impatiently.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Take us to it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory assumed the lead, followed by the band. They had to fight their way\\ninto the last gallery. But Claude, who brought up the rear, still heard\\nthe laughter that rose on the air, a swelling clamour, the roll of a\\ntide near its full. And as he finally entered the room, he beheld a\\nvast, swarming, closely packed crowd pressing eagerly in front of his\\npicture. All the laughter arose, spread, and ended there. And it was his\\npicture that was being laughed at.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh!â\\x80\\x99 repeated Jory, triumphantly, â\\x80\\x98thereâ\\x80\\x99s a success for you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere, intimidated, as ashamed as if he himself had been slapped,\\nmuttered: â\\x80\\x98Too much of a success--I should prefer something different.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What a fool you are,â\\x80\\x99 replied Jory, in a burst of exalted conviction.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I call success. Does it matter a curse if they laugh? We\\nhave made our mark; to-morrow every paper will talk about us.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The idiots,â\\x80\\x99 was all that Sandoz could gasp, choking with grief.\\n\\nFagerolles, disinterested and dignified like a family friend following\\na funeral procession, said nothing. Irma alone remained gay, thinking\\nit all very funny. And, with a caressing gesture, she leant against the\\nshoulder of the derided painter, and whispered softly in his ear: â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nfret, my boy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all humbug, be merry all the same.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Claude did not stir. An icy chill had come over him. For a\\nmoment his heart had almost ceased to beat, so cruel had been the\\ndisappointment And with his eyes enlarged, attracted and fixed by\\na resistless force, he looked at his picture. He was surprised, and\\nscarcely recognised it; it certainly was not such as it had seemed to be\\nin his studio. It had grown yellow beneath the livid light of the linen\\nscreens; it seemed, moreover, to have become smaller; coarser and more\\nlaboured also; and whether it was the effect of the light in which it\\nnow hung, or the contrast of the works beside it, at all events he now\\nat the first glance saw all its defects, after having remained blind\\nto them, as it were, for months. With a few strokes of the brush he, in\\nthought, altered the whole of it, deepened the distances, set a badly\\ndrawn limb right, and modified a tone. Decidedly, the gentleman in the\\nvelveteen jacket was worth nothing at all, he was altogether pasty and\\nbadly seated; the only really good bit of work about him was his hand.\\nIn the background the two little wrestlers--the fair and the dark\\none--had remained too sketchy, and lacked substance; they were amusing\\nonly to an artistâ\\x80\\x99s eye. But he was pleased with the trees, with the\\nsunny glade; and the nude woman--the woman lying on the grass appeared\\nto him superior to his own powers, as if some one else had painted her,\\nand as if he had never yet beheld her in such resplendency of life.\\n\\nHe turned to Sandoz, and said simply:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They do right to laugh; itâ\\x80\\x99s incomplete. Never mind, the woman is all\\nright! Bongrand was not hoaxing me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis friend wished to take him away, but he became obstinate, and drew\\nnearer instead. Now that he had judged his work, he listened and looked\\nat the crowd. The explosion continued--culminated in an ascending scale\\nof mad laughter. No sooner had visitors crossed the threshold than he\\nsaw their jaws part, their eyes grow small, their entire faces expand;\\nand he heard the tempestuous puffing of the fat men, the rusty grating\\njeers of the lean ones, amidst all the shrill, flute-like laughter of\\nthe women. Opposite him, against the hand-rails, some young fellows went\\ninto contortions, as if somebody had been tickling them. One lady had\\nflung herself on a seat, stifling and trying to regain breath with her\\nhandkerchief over her mouth. Rumours of this picture, which was so very,\\nvery funny, must have been spreading, for there was a rush from the four\\ncorners of the Salon, bands of people arrived, jostling each other, and\\nall eagerness to share the fun. â\\x80\\x98Where is it?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Over there.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Oh, what a\\njoke!â\\x80\\x99 And the witticisms fell thicker than elsewhere. It was especially\\nthe subject that caused merriment; people failed to understand it,\\nthought it insane, comical enough to make one ill with laughter. â\\x80\\x98You\\nsee the lady feels too hot, while the gentleman has put on his velveteen\\njacket for fear of catching cold.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Not at all; she is already blue; the\\ngentleman has pulled her out of a pond, and he is resting at a distance,\\nholding his nose.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98I tell you itâ\\x80\\x99s a young ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 school out for a\\nramble. Look at the two playing at leap-frog.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Hallo! washing day;\\nthe flesh is blue; the trees are blue; heâ\\x80\\x99s dipped his picture in the\\nblueing tub!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThose who did not laugh flew into a rage: that bluish tinge, that novel\\nrendering of light seemed an insult to them. Some old gentlemen shook\\ntheir sticks. Was art to be outraged like this? One grave individual\\nwent away very wroth, saying to his wife that he did not like practical\\njokes. But another, a punctilious little man, having looked in the\\ncatalogue for the title of the work, in order to tell his daughter, read\\nout the words, â\\x80\\x98_In the Open Air_,â\\x80\\x99 whereupon there came a formidable\\nrenewal of the clamour, hisses and shouts, and what not else besides.\\nThe title sped about; it was repeated, commented on. â\\x80\\x98_In the Open Air_!\\nah, yes, the open air, the nude woman in the air, everything in the air,\\ntra la la laire.â\\x80\\x99 The affair was becoming a scandal. The crowd still\\nincreased. Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s faces grew red with congestion in the growing heat.\\nEach had the stupidly gaping mouth of the ignoramus who judges painting,\\nand between them they indulged in all the asinine ideas, all the\\npreposterous reflections, all the stupid spiteful jeers that the sight\\nof an original work can possibly elicit from bourgeois imbecility.\\n\\nAt that moment, as a last blow, Claude beheld Dubuche reappear, dragging\\nthe Margaillans along. As soon as he came in front of the picture, the\\narchitect, ill at ease, overtaken by cowardly shame, wished to quicken\\nhis pace and lead his party further on, pretending that he saw neither\\nthe canvas nor his friends. But the contractor had already drawn himself\\nup on his short, squat legs, and was staring at the picture, and asking\\naloud in his thick hoarse voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, whoâ\\x80\\x99s the blockhead that painted this?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThat good-natured bluster, that cry of a millionaire parvenu resuming\\nthe average opinion of the assembly, increased the general merriment;\\nand he, flattered by his success, and tickled by the strange style of\\nthe painting, started laughing in his turn, so sonorously that he could\\nbe heard above all the others. This was the hallelujah, a final outburst\\nof the great organ of opinion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Take my daughter away,â\\x80\\x99 whispered pale-faced Madame Margaillan in\\nDubucheâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\n\\nHe sprang forward and freed Regine, who had lowered her eyelids, from\\nthe crowd; displaying in doing so as much muscular energy as if it had\\nbeen a question of saving the poor creature from imminent death. Then\\nhaving taken leave of the Margaillans at the door, with a deal of\\nhandshaking and bows, he came towards his friends, and said straightway\\nto Sandoz, Fagerolles, and Gagniere:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What would you have? It isnâ\\x80\\x99t my fault--I warned him that the public\\nwould not understand him. Itâ\\x80\\x99s improper; yes, you may say what you like,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s improper.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98They hissed Delacroix,â\\x80\\x99 broke in Sandoz, white with rage, and clenching\\nhis fists. â\\x80\\x98They hissed Courbet. Oh, the race of enemies! Oh, the born\\nidiots!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere, who now shared this artistic vindictiveness, grew angry at the\\nrecollection of his Sunday battles at the Pasdeloup Concerts in favour\\nof real music.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And they hiss Wagner too; they are the same crew. I recognise them. You\\nsee that fat fellow over there--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory had to hold him back. The journalist for his part would rather have\\nurged on the crowd. He kept on repeating that it was famous, that there\\nwas a hundred thousand francsâ\\x80\\x99 worth of advertisements in it. And Irma,\\nleft to her own devices once more, went up to two of her friends, young\\nBourse men who were among the most persistent scoffers, but whom she\\nbegan to indoctrinate, forcing them, as it were, into admiration, by\\nrapping them on the knuckles.\\n\\nFagerolles, however, had not opened his lips. He kept on examining the\\npicture, and glancing at the crowd. With his Parisian instinct and\\nthe elastic conscience of a skilful fellow, he at once fathomed the\\nmisunderstanding. He was already vaguely conscious of what was wanted\\nfor that style of painting to make the conquest of everybody--a little\\ntrickery perhaps, some attenuations, a different choice of subject, a\\nmilder method of execution. In the main, the influence that Claude had\\nalways had over him persisted in making itself felt; he remained imbued\\nwith it; it had set its stamp upon him for ever. Only he considered\\nClaude to be an arch-idiot to have exhibited such a thing as that.\\nWasnâ\\x80\\x99t it stupid to believe in the intelligence of the public? What\\nwas the meaning of that nude woman beside that gentleman who was fully\\ndressed? And what did those two little wrestlers in the background mean?\\nYet the picture showed many of the qualities of a master. There wasnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nanother bit of painting like it in the Salon! And he felt a great\\ncontempt for that artist, so admirably endowed, who through lack of tact\\nmade all Paris roar as if he had been the worst of daubers.\\n\\nThis contempt became so strong that he was unable to hide it. In a\\nmoment of irresistible frankness he exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look here, my dear fellow, itâ\\x80\\x99s your own fault, you are too stupid.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, turning his eyes from the crowd, looked at him in silence. He\\nhad not winced, he had only turned pale amidst the laughter, and if his\\nlips quivered it was merely with a slight nervous twitching; nobody knew\\nhim, it was his work alone that was being buffeted. Then for a moment he\\nglanced again at his picture, and slowly inspected the other canvases in\\nthe gallery. And amidst the collapse of his illusions, the bitter agony\\nof his pride, a breath of courage, a whiff of health and youth came to\\nhim from all that gaily-brave painting which rushed with such headlong\\npassion to beat down classical conventionality. He was consoled and\\ninspirited by it all; he felt no remorse nor contrition, but, on the\\ncontrary, was impelled to fight the popular taste still more. No doubt\\nthere was some clumsiness and some puerility of effort in his work, but\\non the other hand what a pretty general tone, what a play of light he\\nhad thrown into it, a silvery grey light, fine and diffuse, brightened\\nby all the dancing sunbeams of the open air. It was as if a window\\nhad been suddenly opened amidst all the old bituminous cookery of art,\\namidst all the stewing sauces of tradition, and the sun came in and the\\nwalls smiled under that invasion of springtide. The light note of his\\npicture, the bluish tinge that people had been railing at, flashed out\\namong the other paintings also. Was this not the expected dawn, a\\nnew aurora rising on art? He perceived a critic who stopped without\\nlaughing, some celebrated painters who looked surprised and grave, while\\nPapa Malgras, very dirty, went from picture to picture with the pout of\\na wary connoisseur, and finally stopped short in front of his canvas,\\nmotionless, absorbed. Then Claude turned round to Fagerolles, and\\nsurprised him by this tardy reply:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A fellow can only be an idiot according to his own lights, my dear\\nchap, and it looks as if I am going to remain one. So much the better\\nfor you if you are clever!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles at once patted him on the shoulder, like a chum who had only\\nbeen in fun, and Claude allowed Sandoz to take his arm. They led him off\\nat last. The whole band left the Salon of the Rejected, deciding that\\nthey would pass on their way through the gallery of architecture; for\\na design for a museum by Dubuche had been accepted, and for some few\\nminutes he had been fidgeting and begging them with so humble a look,\\nthat it seemed difficult indeed to deny him this satisfaction.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah!â\\x80\\x99 said Jory, jocularly, on entering the gallery, â\\x80\\x98what an ice-well!\\nOne can breathe here.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all took off their hats and wiped their foreheads, with a feeling\\nof relief, as if they had reached some big shady trees after a long\\nmarch in full sunlight. The gallery was empty. From the roof, shaded by\\na white linen screen, there fell a soft, even, rather sad light, which\\nwas reflected like quiescent water by the well-waxed, mirror-like floor.\\nOn the four walls, of a faded red, hung the plans and designs in large\\nand small chases, edged with pale blue borders. Alone--absolutely\\nalone--amidst this desert stood a very hirsute gentleman, who was lost\\nin the contemplation of the plan of a charity home. Three ladies who\\nappeared became frightened and fled across the gallery with hasty steps.\\n\\nDubuche was already showing and explaining his work to his comrades. It\\nwas only a drawing of a modest little museum gallery, which he had sent\\nin with ambitious haste, contrary to custom and against the wishes\\nof his master, who, nevertheless, had used his influence to have it\\naccepted, thinking himself pledged to do so.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is your museum intended for the accommodation of the paintings of the\\nâ\\x80\\x9copen airâ\\x80\\x9d school?â\\x80\\x99 asked Fagerolles, very gravely.\\n\\nGagniere pretended to admire the plan, nodding his head, but thinking\\nof something else; while Claude and Sandoz examined it with sincere\\ninterest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not bad, old boy,â\\x80\\x99 said the former. â\\x80\\x98The ornamentation is still\\nbastardly traditional; but never mind; it will do.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory, becoming impatient at last, cut him short.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come along, letâ\\x80\\x99s go, eh? Iâ\\x80\\x99m catching my death of cold here.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe band resumed its march. The worst was that to make a short cut they\\nhad to go right through the official Salon, and they resigned themselves\\nto doing so, notwithstanding the oath they had taken not to set foot in\\nit, as a matter of protest. Cutting their way through the crowd, keeping\\nrigidly erect, they followed the suite of galleries, casting indignant\\nglances to right and left. There was none of the gay scandal of their\\nSalon, full of fresh tones and an exaggeration of sunlight, here. One\\nafter the other came gilt frames full of shadows; black pretentious\\nthings, nude figures showing yellowish in a cellar-like light, the\\nfrippery of so-called classical art, historical, genre and landscape\\npainting, all showing the same conventional black grease. The works\\nreeked of uniform mediocrity, they were characterised by a muddy\\ndinginess of tone, despite their primness--the primness of impoverished,\\ndegenerate blood. And the friends quickened their steps: they ran to\\nescape from that reign of bitumen, condemning everything in one lump\\nwith their superb sectarian injustice, repeating that there was nothing\\nin the place worth looking at--nothing, nothing at all!\\n\\nAt last they emerged from the galleries, and were going down into the\\ngarden when they met Mahoudeau and Chaine. The former threw himself into\\nClaudeâ\\x80\\x99s arms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, my dear fellow, your picture; what artistic temperament it shows!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter at once began to praise the â\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girl.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you, I say, you have thrown a nice big lump at their heads!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut the sight of Chaine, to whom no one spoke about the â\\x80\\x98Woman taken\\nin Adultery,â\\x80\\x99 and who went silently wandering around, awakened Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncompassion. He thought there was something very sad about that execrable\\npainting, and the wasted life of that peasant who was a victim of\\nmiddle-class admiration. He always gave him the delight of a little\\npraise; so now he shook his hand cordially, exclaiming:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your machineâ\\x80\\x99s very good too. Ah, my fine fellow, draughtsmanship has\\nno terrors for you!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, indeed,â\\x80\\x99 declared Chaine, who had grown purple with vanity under\\nhis black bushy beard.\\n\\nHe and Mahoudeau joined the band, and the latter asked the others\\nwhether they had seen Chambouvardâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Sower.â\\x80\\x99 It was marvellous; the\\nonly piece of statuary worth looking at in the Salon. Thereupon they all\\nfollowed him into the garden, which the crowd was now invading.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, stopping in the middle of the central path:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Chambouvard is standing just in front of his â\\x80\\x9cSower.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, a portly man stood there, solidly planted on his fat legs, and\\nadmiring his handiwork. With his head sunk between his shoulders, he had\\nthe heavy, handsome features of a Hindu idol. He was said to be the son\\nof a veterinary surgeon of the neighbourhood of Amiens. At forty-five\\nhe had already produced twenty masterpieces: statues all simplicity\\nand life, flesh modern and palpitating, kneaded by a workman of\\ngenius, without any pretension to refinement; and all this was chance\\nproduction, for he furnished work as a field bears harvest, good one\\nday, bad the next, in absolute ignorance of what he created. He carried\\nthe lack of critical acumen to such a degree that he made no distinction\\nbetween the most glorious offspring of his hands and the detestably\\ngrotesque figures which now and then he chanced to put together. Never\\ntroubled by nervous feverishness, never doubting, always solid and\\nconvinced, he had the pride of a god.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Wonderful, the â\\x80\\x9cSowerâ\\x80\\x9d!â\\x80\\x99 whispered Claude. â\\x80\\x98What a figure! and what an\\nattitude!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles, who had not looked at the statue, was highly amused by the\\ngreat man, and the string of young, open-mouthed disciples whom as usual\\nhe dragged at his tail.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just look at them, one would think they are taking the sacrament, â\\x80\\x98pon\\nmy word--and he himself, eh? What a fine brutish face he has!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIsolated, and quite at his ease, amidst the general curiosity,\\nChambouvard stood there wondering, with the stupefied air of a man who\\nis surprised at having produced such a masterpiece. He seemed to behold\\nit for the first time, and was unable to get over his astonishment. Then\\nan expression of delight gradually stole over his broad face, he nodded\\nhis head, and burst into soft, irresistible laughter, repeating a dozen\\ntimes, â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s comical, itâ\\x80\\x99s really comical!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis train of followers went into raptures, while he himself could find\\nnothing more forcible to express how much he worshipped himself. All at\\nonce there was a slight stir. Bongrand, who had been walking about\\nwith his hands behind his back, glancing vaguely around him, had just\\nstumbled on Chambouvard, and the public, drawing back, whispered, and\\nwatched the two celebrated artists shaking hands; the one short and of\\na sanguine temperament, the other tall and restless. Some expressions of\\ngood-fellowship were overheard. â\\x80\\x98Always fresh marvels.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Of course! And\\nyou, nothing this year?â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98No, nothing; I am resting, seeking--â\\x80\\x99\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, you joker! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no need to seek, the thing comes by itself.â\\x80\\x99\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-bye.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Good-bye.â\\x80\\x99 And Chambouvard, followed by his court, was\\nalready moving slowly away among the crowd, with the glances of a king,\\nwho enjoys life, while Bongrand, who had recognised Claude and his\\nfriends, approached them with outstretched feverish hands, and called\\nattention to the sculptor with a nervous jerk of the chin, saying,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fellow I envy! Ah! to be confident of always producing\\nmasterpieces!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe complimented Mahoudeau on his â\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girlâ\\x80\\x99; showed himself\\npaternal to all of them, with that broad-minded good-nature of his, the\\nfree and easy manner of an old Bohemian of the romantic school, who had\\nsettled down and was decorated. Then, turning to Claude:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, what did I tell you? Did you see upstairs? You have become the\\nchief of a school.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! yes,â\\x80\\x99 replied Claude. â\\x80\\x98They are giving it me nicely. You are the\\nmaster of us all.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Bongrand made his usual gesture of vague suffering and went off,\\nsaying, â\\x80\\x98Hold your tongue! I am not even my own master.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor a few moments longer the band wandered through the garden. They\\nhad gone back to look at the â\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girl,â\\x80\\x99 when Jory noticed that\\nGagniere no longer had Irma Becot on his arm. Gagniere was stupefied;\\nwhere the deuce could he have lost her? But when Fagerolles had told him\\nthat she had gone off in the crowd with two gentlemen, he recovered his\\ncomposure, and followed the others, lighter of heart now that he was\\nrelieved of that girl who had bewildered him.\\n\\nPeople now only moved about with difficulty. All the seats were taken by\\nstorm; groups blocked up the paths, where the promenaders paused every\\nnow and then, flowing back around the successful bits of bronze and\\nmarble. From the crowded buffet there arose a loud buzzing, a clatter\\nof saucers and spoons which mingled with the throb of life pervading\\nthe vast nave. The sparrows had flown up to the forest of iron girders\\nagain, and one could hear their sharp little chirps, the twittering with\\nwhich they serenaded the setting sun, under the warm panes of the glass\\nroof. The atmosphere, moreover, had become heavy, there was a damp\\ngreenhouse-like warmth; the air, stationary as it was, had an odour as\\nof humus, freshly turned over. And rising above the garden throng,\\nthe din of the first-floor galleries, the tramping of feet on their\\niron-girdered flooring still rolled on with the clamour of a tempest\\nbeating against a cliff.\\n\\nClaude, who had a keen perception of that rumbling storm, ended by\\nhearing nothing else; it had been let loose and was howling in his\\nears. It was the merriment of the crowd whose jeers and laughter swept\\nhurricane-like past his picture. With a weary gesture he exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, what are we messing about here for? I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t take anything at\\nthe refreshment bar, it reeks of the Institute. Letâ\\x80\\x99s go and have a\\nglass of beer outside, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all went out, with sinking legs and tired faces, expressive of\\ncontempt. Once outside, on finding themselves again face to face with\\nhealthy mother Nature in her springtide season, they breathed noisily\\nwith an air of delight. It had barely struck four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the slanting\\nsun swept along the Champs Elysees and everything flared: the serried\\nrows of carriages, like the fresh foliage of the trees, and the\\nsheaf-like fountains which spouted up and whirled away in golden dust.\\nWith a sauntering step they went hesitatingly down the central avenue,\\nand finally stranded in a little cafe, the Pavillon de la Concorde, on\\nthe left, just before reaching the Place. The place was so small that\\nthey sat down outside it at the edge of the footway, despite the chill\\nwhich fell from a vault of leaves, already fully grown and gloomy.\\nBut beyond the four rows of chestnut-trees, beyond the belt of verdant\\nshade, they could see the sunlit roadway of the main avenue where Paris\\npassed before them as in a nimbus, the carriages with their wheels\\nradiating like stars, the big yellow omnibuses, looking even more\\nprofusely gilded than triumphal chariots, the horsemen whose steeds\\nseemed to raise clouds of sparks, and the foot passengers whom the light\\nenveloped in splendour.\\n\\nAnd during nearly three hours, with his beer untasted before him, Claude\\nwent on talking and arguing amid a growing fever, broken down as he was\\nin body, and with his mind full of all the painting he had just seen. It\\nwas the usual winding up of their visit to the Salon, though this year\\nthey were more impassioned on account of the liberal measure of the\\nEmperor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, and what of it, if the public does laugh?â\\x80\\x99 cried Claude. â\\x80\\x98We must\\neducate the public, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. In reality itâ\\x80\\x99s a victory. Take away two\\nhundred grotesque canvases, and our Salon beats theirs. We have courage\\nand audacity--we are the future. Yes, yes, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see it later on; we\\nshall kill their Salon. We shall enter it as conquerors, by dint of\\nproducing masterpieces. Laugh, laugh, you big stupid Paris--laugh until\\nyou fall on your knees before us!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd stopping short, he pointed prophetically to the triumphal avenue,\\nwhere the luxury and happiness of the city went rolling by in the\\nsunlight. His arms stretched out till they embraced even the Place de\\nla Concorde, which could be seen slantwise from where they sat under the\\ntrees--the Place de la Concorde, with the plashing water of one of its\\nfountains, a strip of balustrade, and two of its statues--Rouen, with\\nthe gigantic bosom, and Lille, thrusting forward her huge bare foot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cIn the open airâ\\x80\\x9d--it amuses them, eh?â\\x80\\x99 he resumed. â\\x80\\x98All right, since\\nthey are bent on it, the â\\x80\\x9copen airâ\\x80\\x9d then, the school of the â\\x80\\x9copen air!â\\x80\\x9d\\n Eh! it was a thing strictly between us, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist yesterday beyond\\nthe circle of a few painters. But now they throw the word upon the\\nwinds, and they found the school. Oh! Iâ\\x80\\x99m agreeable. Let it be the\\nschool of the â\\x80\\x9copen air!â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory slapped his thighs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Didnâ\\x80\\x99t I tell you? I felt sure of making them bite with those articles\\nof mine, the idiots that they are. Ah! how weâ\\x80\\x99ll plague them now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMahoudeau also was singing victory, constantly dragging in his\\nâ\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girl,â\\x80\\x99 the daring points of which he explained to the silent\\nChaine, the only one who listened to him; while Gagniere, with the\\nsternness of a timid man waxing wroth over questions of pure theory,\\nspoke of guillotining the Institute; and Sandoz, with the glowing\\nsympathy of a hard worker, and Dubuche, giving way to the contagion\\nof revolutionary friendship, became exasperated, and struck the table,\\nswallowing up Paris with each draught of beer. Fagerolles, very calm,\\nretained his usual smile. He had accompanied them for the sake of\\namusement, for the singular pleasure which he found in urging his\\ncomrades into farcical affairs that were bound to turn out badly. At\\nthe very moment when he was lashing their spirit of revolt, he himself\\nformed the firm resolution to work in future for the Prix de Rome. That\\nday had decided him; he thought it idiotic to compromise his prospects\\nany further.\\n\\nThe sun was declining on the horizon, there was now only a returning\\nstream of carriages, coming back from the Bois in the pale golden\\nshimmer of the sunset. And the exodus from the Salon must have been\\nnearly over; a long string of pedestrians passed by, gentlemen who\\nlooked like critics, each with a catalogue under his arm.\\n\\nBut all at once Gagniere became enthusiastic: â\\x80\\x98Ah! Courajod, there was\\none who had his share in inventing landscape painting! Have you seen his\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPond of Gagnyâ\\x80\\x9d at the Luxembourg?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A marvel!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude. â\\x80\\x98It was painted thirty years ago, and\\nnothing more substantial has been turned out since. Why is it left at\\nthe Luxembourg? It ought to be in the Louvre.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But Courajod isnâ\\x80\\x99t dead,â\\x80\\x99 said Fagerolles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! Courajod isnâ\\x80\\x99t dead! No one ever sees him or speaks of him now.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was general stupefaction when Fagerolles assured them that the\\ngreat landscape painter, now seventy years of age, lived somewhere in\\nthe neighbourhood of Montmartre, in a little house among his fowls,\\nducks, and dogs. So one might outlive oneâ\\x80\\x99s own glory! To think that\\nthere were such melancholy instances of old artists disappearing before\\ntheir death! Silence fell upon them all; they began to shiver when they\\nperceived Bongrand pass by on a friendâ\\x80\\x99s arm, with a congestive face\\nand a nervous air as he waved his hand to them; while almost immediately\\nbehind him, surrounded by his disciples, came Chambouvard, laughing very\\nloudly, and tapping his heels on the pavement with the air of absolute\\nmastery that comes from confidence in immortality.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! are you going?â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau to Chaine, who was rising from his\\nchair.\\n\\nThe other mumbled some indistinct words in his beard, and went off after\\ndistributing handshakes among the party.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I know,â\\x80\\x99 said Jory to Mahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98I believe he has a weakness for your\\nneighbour, the herbalist woman. I saw his eyes flash all at once; it\\ncomes upon him like toothache. Look how heâ\\x80\\x99s running over there.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe sculptor shrugged his shoulders amidst the general laughter.\\n\\nBut Claude did not hear. He was now discussing architecture with\\nDubuche. No doubt, that plan of a museum gallery which he exhibited\\nwasnâ\\x80\\x99t bad; only there was nothing new in it. It was all so much patient\\nmarquetry of the school formulas. Ought not all the arts to advance\\nin one line of battle? Ought not the evolution that was transforming\\nliterature, painting, even music itself, to renovate architecture as\\nwell? If ever the architecture of a period was to have a style of its\\nown, it was assuredly the architecture of the period they would soon be\\nentering, a new period when they would find the ground freshly swept,\\nready for the rebuilding of everything. Down with the Greek temples!\\nthere was no reason why they should continue to exist under our sky,\\namid our society! down with the Gothic cathedrals, since faith in legend\\nwas dead! down with the delicate colonnades, the lace-like work of\\nthe Renaissance--that revival of the antique grafted on\\nmediaevalism--precious art-jewellery, no doubt, but in which democracy\\ncould not dwell. And he demanded, he called with violent gestures for an\\narchitectural formula suited to democracy; such work in stone as would\\nexpress its tenets; edifices where it would really be at home; something\\nvast and strong, great and simple at the same time; the something that\\nwas already being indicated in the new railway stations and markets,\\nwhose ironwork displayed such solid elegance, but purified and raised\\nto a standard of beauty, proclaiming the grandeur of the intellectual\\nconquests of the age.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! yes, ah! yes,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Dubuche, catching Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s enthusiasm;\\nâ\\x80\\x98thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I want to accomplish, youâ\\x80\\x99ll see some day. Give me time to\\nsucceed, and when Iâ\\x80\\x99m my own master--ah! when Iâ\\x80\\x99m my own master.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNight was coming on apace, and Claude was growing more and more animated\\nand passionate, displaying a fluency, an eloquence which his comrades\\nhad not known him to possess. They all grew excited in listening to him,\\nand ended by becoming noisily gay over the extraordinary witticisms\\nhe launched forth. He himself, having returned to the subject of his\\npicture, again discussed it with a deal of gaiety, caricaturing the\\ncrowd he had seen looking at it, and imitating the imbecile laughter.\\nAlong the avenue, now of an ashy hue, one only saw the shadows of\\ninfrequent vehicles dart by. The side-walk was quite black; an icy chill\\nfell from the trees. Nothing broke the stillness but the sound of song\\ncoming from a clump of verdure behind the cafe; there was some rehearsal\\nat the Concert de lâ\\x80\\x99Horloge, for one heard the sentimental voice of a\\ngirl trying a love-song.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! how they amused me, the idiots!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, in a last burst.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do you know, I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t take a hundred thousand francs for my dayâ\\x80\\x99s\\npleasure!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen he relapsed into silence, thoroughly exhausted. Nobody had any\\nsaliva left; silence reigned; they all shivered in the icy gust that\\nswept by. And they separated in a sort of bewilderment, shaking hands\\nin a tired fashion. Dubuche was going to dine out; Fagerolles had an\\nappointment; in vain did Jory, Mahoudeau, and Gagniere try to drag\\nClaude to Foucartâ\\x80\\x99s, a twenty-five sousâ\\x80\\x99 restaurant; Sandoz was already\\ntaking him away on his arm, feeling anxious at seeing him so excited.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come along, I promised my mother to be back for dinner. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll take a\\nbit with us. It will be nice; weâ\\x80\\x99ll finish the day together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey both went down the quay, past the Tuileries, walking side by side\\nin fraternal fashion. But at the Pont des Saints-Peres the painter\\nstopped short.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, are you going to leave me?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Sandoz.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, I thought you were going to dine with me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, thanks; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve too bad a headache--Iâ\\x80\\x99m going home to bed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he obstinately clung to this excuse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right, old man,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz at last, with a smile. â\\x80\\x98One doesnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsee much of you nowadays. You live in mystery. Go on, old boy, I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nwant to be in your way.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude restrained a gesture of impatience; and, letting his friend cross\\nthe bridge, he went his way along the quays by himself. He walked on\\nwith his arms hanging beside him, with his face turned towards the\\nground, seeing nothing, but taking long strides like a somnambulist who\\nis guided by instinct. On the Quai de Bourbon, in front of his door, he\\nlooked up, full of surprise on seeing a cab waiting at the edge of the\\nfoot pavement, and barring his way. And it was with the same automatical\\nstep that he entered the doorkeeperâ\\x80\\x99s room to take his key.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have given it to that lady,â\\x80\\x99 called Madame Joseph from the back of\\nthe room. â\\x80\\x98She is upstairs.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What lady?â\\x80\\x99 he asked in bewilderment.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That young person. Come, you know very well, the one who always comes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had not the remotest idea whom she meant. Still, in his utter\\nconfusion of mind, he decided to go upstairs. The key was in the door,\\nwhich he slowly opened and closed again.\\n\\nFor a moment Claude stood stock still. Darkness had invaded the studio;\\na violet dimness, a melancholy gloom fell from the large window,\\nenveloping everything. He could no longer plainly distinguish either\\nthe floor, or the furniture, or the sketches; everything that was lying\\nabout seemed to be melting in the stagnant waters of a pool. But on\\nthe edge of the couch there loomed a dark figure, stiff with waiting,\\nanxious and despairing amid the last gasp of daylight. It was Christine;\\nhe recognised her.\\n\\nShe held out her hands, and murmured in a low, halting voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have been here for three hours; yes, for three hours, all alone, and\\nlistening. I took a cab on leaving there, and I only wanted to stay a\\nminute, and get back as soon as possible. But I should have stayed all\\nnight; I could not go away without shaking hands with you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe continued, and told him of her mad desire to see the picture; her\\nprank of going to the Salon, and how she had tumbled into it amidst the\\nstorm of laughter, amidst the jeers of all those people. It was she whom\\nthey had hissed like that; it was on herself that they had spat. And\\nseized with wild terror, distracted with grief and shame, she had fled,\\nas if she could feel that laughter lashing her like a whip, until the\\nblood flowed. But she now forgot about herself in her concern for\\nhim, upset by the thought of the grief he must feel, for her womanly\\nsensibility magnified the bitterness of the repulse, and she was eager\\nto console.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, friend, donâ\\x80\\x99t grieve! I wished to see and tell you that they are\\njealous of it all, that I found the picture very nice, and that I feel\\nvery proud and happy at having helped you--at being, if ever so little,\\na part of it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nStill, motionless, he listened to her as she stammered those tender\\nwords in an ardent voice, and suddenly he sank down at her feet,\\nletting his head fall upon her knees, and bursting into tears. All his\\nexcitement of the afternoon, all the bravery he had shown amidst the\\njeering, all his gaiety and violence now collapsed, in a fit of sobs\\nwhich well nigh choked him. From the gallery where the laughter had\\nbuffeted him, he heard it pursuing him through the Champs Elysees, then\\nalong the banks of the Seine, and now in his very studio. His strength\\nwas utterly spent; he felt weaker than a child; and rolling his head\\nfrom one side to another he repeated in a stifled voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My God! how I do suffer!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen she, with both hands, raised his face to her lips in a transport of\\npassion. She kissed him, and with her warm breath she blew to his very\\nheart the words: â\\x80\\x98Be quiet, be quiet, I love you!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey adored each other; it was inevitable. Near them, on the centre of\\nthe table, the lilac she had sent him that morning embalmed the night\\nair, and, alone shiny with lingering light, the scattered particles of\\ngold leaf, wafted from the frame of the big picture, twinkled like a\\nswarming of stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\nTHE very next morning, at seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Christine was at the studio,\\nher face still flushed by the falsehood which she had told Madame\\nVanzade about a young friend from Clermont whom she was to meet at the\\nstation, and with whom she should spend the day.\\n\\nClaude, overjoyed by the idea of spending a whole day with her, wanted\\nto take her into the country, far away under the glorious sunlight, so\\nas to have her entirely to himself. She was delighted; they scampered\\noff like lunatics, and reached the St. Lazare Station just in time to\\ncatch the Havre train. He knew, beyond Mantes, a little village called\\nBennecourt, where there was an artistsâ\\x80\\x99 inn which he had at times\\ninvaded with some comrades; and careless as to the two hoursâ\\x80\\x99 rail, he\\ntook her to lunch there, just as he would have taken her to Asnieres.\\nShe made very merry over this journey, to which there seemed no end.\\nSo much the better if it were to take them to the end of the world! It\\nseemed to them as if evening would never come.\\n\\nAt ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock they alighted at Bonnieres; and there they took the\\nferry--an old ferry-boat that creaked and grated against its chain--for\\nBennecourt is situated on the opposite bank of the Seine. It was a\\nsplendid May morning, the rippling waters were spangled with gold in\\nthe sunlight, the young foliage showed delicately green against the\\ncloudless azure. And, beyond the islets situated at this point of the\\nriver, how delightful it was to find the country inn, with its little\\ngrocery business attached, its large common room smelling of soapsuds,\\nand its spacious yard full of manure, on which the ducks disported\\nthemselves.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, Faucheur! we have come to lunch. An omelette, some sausages, and\\nsome cheese, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you going to stay the night, Monsieur Claude?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no; another time. And some white wine; eh? you know that pinky\\nwine, that grates a bit in the throat.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine had already followed mother Faucheur to the barn-yard, and\\nwhen the latter came back with her eggs, she asked Claude with her\\nartful peasantâ\\x80\\x99s laugh:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And so now youâ\\x80\\x99re married?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 replied the painter without hesitation, â\\x80\\x98it looks like it since\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m with my wife.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe lunch was exquisite: the omelette overdone, the sausages too greasy,\\nand the bread so hard that he had to cut it into fingers for Christine\\nlest she should hurt her wrist. They emptied two bottles of wine, and\\nbegan a third, becoming so gay and noisy that they ended by feeling\\nbewildered in the long room, where they partook of the meal all alone.\\nShe, with her cheeks aflame, declared that she was tipsy; it had never\\nhappened to her before, and she thought it very funny. Oh! so funny, and\\nshe burst into uncontrollable laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Let us get a breath of air,â\\x80\\x99 she said at last.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a stroll. We must start back at four oâ\\x80\\x99clock; so we\\nhave three hours before us.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey went up the village of Bennecourt, whose yellow houses straggle\\nalong the river bank for about a couple of thousand yards. All the\\nvillagers were in the fields; they only met three cows, led by a little\\ngirl. He, with an outstretched arm, told her all about the locality;\\nseemed to know whither he was going, and when they had reached the last\\nhouse--an old building, standing on the bank of the Seine, just opposite\\nthe slopes of Jeufosse--turned round it, and entered a wood of oak\\ntrees. It was like the end of the world, roofed in with foliage, through\\nwhich the sun alone penetrated in narrow tongues of flame. And there\\nthey could stroll and talk and kiss in freedom.\\n\\nWhen at last it became necessary for them to retrace their steps,\\nthey found a peasant standing at the open doorway of the house by the\\nwood-side. Claude recognised the man and called to him:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, Porrette! Does that shanty belong to you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this the old fellow, with tears in his eyes, related that it did,\\nand that his tenants had gone away without paying him, leaving their\\nfurniture behind. And he invited them inside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no harm in looking; you may know somebody who would like to\\ntake the place. There are many Parisians whoâ\\x80\\x99d be glad of it. Three\\nhundred francs a year, with the furniture; itâ\\x80\\x99s for nothing, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey inquisitively followed him inside. It was a rambling old place that\\nseemed to have been cut out of a barn. Downstairs they found an immense\\nkitchen and a dining-room, in which one might have given a dance;\\nupstairs were two rooms also, so vast that one seemed lost in them.\\nAs for the furniture, it consisted of a walnut bedstead in one of the\\nrooms, and of a table and some household utensils in the kitchen. But\\nin front of the house the neglected garden was planted with magnificent\\napricot trees, and overgrown with large rose-bushes in full bloom; while\\nat the back there was a potato field reaching as far as the oak wood,\\nand surrounded by a quick-set hedge.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99d leave the potatoes as they are,â\\x80\\x99 said old Porrette.\\n\\nClaude and Christine looked at each other with one of those sudden\\ncravings for solitude and forgetfulness common to lovers. Ah! how sweet\\nit would be to love one another there in the depths of that nook, so\\nfar away from everybody else! But they smiled. Was such a thing to be\\nthought of? They had barely time to catch the train that was to take\\nthem back to Paris. And the old peasant, who was Madame Faucheurâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfather, accompanied them along the river bank, and as they were stepping\\ninto the ferry-boat, shouted to them, after quite an inward struggle:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You know, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make it two hundred and fifty francs--send me some\\npeople.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn reaching Paris, Claude accompanied Christine to Madame Vanzadeâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndoor. They had grown very sad. They exchanged a long handshake, silent\\nand despairing, not daring to kiss each other there.\\n\\nA life of torment then began. In the course of a fortnight she was only\\nable to call on three occasions; and she arrived panting, having but a\\nfew minutes at her disposal, for it so happened that the old lady had\\njust then become very exacting. Claude questioned her, feeling uneasy\\nat seeing her look so pale and out of sorts, with her eyes bright with\\nfever. Never had that pious house, that vault, without air or light,\\nwhere she died of boredom, caused her so much suffering. Her fits of\\ngiddiness had come upon her again; the want of exercise made the blood\\nthrob in her temples. She owned to him that she had fainted one evening\\nin her room, as if she had been suddenly strangled by a leaden hand.\\nStill she did not say a word against her employer; on the contrary, she\\nsoftened on speaking of her: the poor creature, so old and so infirm,\\nand so kind-hearted, who called her daughter! She felt as if she were\\ncommitting a wicked act each time that she forsook her to hurry to her\\nloverâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nTwo more weeks went by, and the falsehoods with which Christine had to\\nbuy, as it were, each hour of liberty became intolerable to her. She\\nloved, she would have liked to proclaim it aloud, and her feelings\\nrevolted at having to hide her love like a crime, at having to lie\\nbasely, like a servant afraid of being sent away.\\n\\nAt last, one evening in the studio, at the moment when she was leaving,\\nshe threw herself with a distracted gesture into Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s arms, sobbing\\nwith suffering and passion. â\\x80\\x98Ah! I cannot, I cannot--keep me with you;\\nprevent me from going back.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had caught hold of her, and was almost smothering her with kisses.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You really love me, then! Oh, my darling! But I am so very poor, and\\nyou would lose everything. Can I allow you to forego everything like\\nthis?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe sobbed more violently still; her halting words were choked by her\\ntears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The money, eh? which she might leave me? Do you think I calculate? I\\nhave never thought of it, I swear it to you! Ah! let her keep everything\\nand let me be free! I have no ties, no relatives; canâ\\x80\\x99t I be allowed to\\ndo as I like?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, in a last sob of agony: â\\x80\\x98Ah, you are right; itâ\\x80\\x99s wrong to desert\\nthe poor woman. Ah! I despise myself. I wish I had the strength. But I\\nlove you too much, I suffer too much; surely you wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me die?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh!â\\x80\\x99 he cried in a passionate transport. â\\x80\\x98Let others die, there are but\\nwe two on earth.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was all so much madness. Christine left Madame Vanzade in the most\\nbrutal fashion. She took her trunk away the very next morning. She and\\nClaude had at once remembered the deserted old house at Bennecourt, the\\ngiant rose-bushes, the immense rooms. Ah! to go away, to go away without\\nthe loss of an hour, to live at the worldâ\\x80\\x99s end in all the bliss of\\ntheir passion! She clapped her hands for very joy. He, still smarting\\nfrom his defeat, at the Salon, and anxious to recover from it, longed\\nfor complete rest in the country; yonder he would find the real â\\x80\\x98open\\nair,â\\x80\\x99 he would work away with grass up to his neck and bring back\\nmasterpieces. In a couple of days everything was ready, the studio\\nrelinquished, the few household chattels conveyed to the railway\\nstation. Besides, they met with a slice of luck, for Papa Malgras gave\\nsome five hundred francs for a score of sketches, selected from among\\nthe waifs and strays of the removal. Thus they would be able to live\\nlike princes. Claude still had his income of a thousand francs a year;\\nChristine, too, had saved some money, besides having her outfit and\\ndresses. And away they went; it was perfect flight, friends avoided and\\nnot even warned by letter, Paris despised and forsaken amid laughter\\nexpressive of relief.\\n\\nJune was drawing to a close, and the rain fell in torrents during the\\nweek they spent in arranging their new home. They discovered that old\\nPorrette had taken away half the kitchen utensils before signing the\\nagreement. But that matter did not affect them. They took a delight\\nin dabbling about amidst the showers; they made journeys three leagues\\nlong, as far as Vernon, to buy plates and saucepans, which they brought\\nback with them in triumph. At last they got shipshape, occupying one of\\nthe upstairs rooms, abandoning the other to the mice, and transforming\\nthe dining-room into a studio; and, above all, as happy as children\\nat taking their meals in the kitchen off a deal table, near the hearth\\nwhere the soup sang in the pot. To wait upon them they engaged a girl\\nfrom the village, who came every morning and went home at night. She\\nwas called Melie, she was a niece of the Faucheurs, and her stupidity\\ndelighted them. In fact, one could not have found a greater idiot in the\\nwhole region.\\n\\nThe sun having shown itself again, some delightful days followed, the\\nmonths slipping away amid monotonous felicity. They never knew the date,\\nthey were for ever mixing up the days of the week. Every day, after the\\nsecond breakfast, came endless strolls, long walks across the tableland\\nplanted with apple trees, over the grassy country roads, along the banks\\nof the Seine through the meadows as far as La Roche-Guyon; and there\\nwere still more distant explorations, perfect journeys on the opposite\\nside of the river, amid the cornfields of Bonnieres and Jeufosse. A\\nperson who was obliged to leave the neighbourhood sold them an old boat\\nfor thirty francs, so that they also had the river at their disposal,\\nand, like savages, became seized with a passion for it, living on its\\nwaters for days together, rowing about, discovering new countries, and\\nlingering for hours under the willows on the banks, or in little creeks,\\ndark with shade. Betwixt the eyots scattered along the stream there was\\na shifting and mysterious city, a network of passages along which, with\\nthe lower branches of the trees caressingly brushing against them, they\\nsoftly glided, alone, as it were, in the world, with the ringdoves and\\nthe kingfishers. He at times had to spring out upon the sand, with bare\\nlegs, to push off the skiff. She bravely plied the oars, bent on forcing\\nher way against the strongest currents, and exulting in her strength.\\nAnd in the evening they ate cabbage soup in the kitchen, laughing at\\nMelieâ\\x80\\x99s stupidity, as they had laughed at it the day before; to begin\\nthe morrow just in the same fashion.\\n\\nEvery evening, however, Christine said to Claude:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Now, my dear, you must promise me one thing--that youâ\\x80\\x99ll set to work\\nto-morrow.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, to-morrow; I give you my word.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you know if you donâ\\x80\\x99t, I shall really get angry this time. Is it I\\nwho prevent you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You! what an idea. Since I came here to work--dash it all! youâ\\x80\\x99ll see\\nto-morrow.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn the morrow they started off again in the skiff; she looked at him\\nwith an embarrassed smile when she saw that he took neither canvas nor\\ncolours. Then she kissed him, laughing, proud of her power, moved by\\nthe constant sacrifice he made to her. And then came fresh affectionate\\nremonstrances: â\\x80\\x98To-morrow, ah! to-morrow she would tie him to his\\neasel!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, Claude did make some attempts at work. He began a study of\\nthe slopes of Jeufosse, with the Seine in the foreground; but Christine\\nfollowed him to the islet where he had installed himself, and sat down\\non the grass close to him with parted lips, her eyes watching the\\nblue sky. And she looked so pretty there amidst the verdure, in that\\nsolitude, where nothing broke the silence but the rippling of the water,\\nthat every minute he relinquished his palette to nestle by her side. On\\nanother occasion, he was altogether charmed by an old farmhouse, shaded\\nby some antiquated apple trees which had grown to the size of oaks. He\\ncame thither two days in succession, but on the third Christine took him\\nto the market at Bonnieres to buy some hens. The next day was also lost;\\nthe canvas had dried; then he grew impatient in trying to work at it\\nagain, and finally abandoned it altogether. Throughout the warm weather\\nhe thus made but a pretence to work--barely roughing out little bits of\\npainting, which he laid aside on the first pretext, without an effort at\\nperseverance. His passion for toil, that fever of former days that had\\nmade him rise at daybreak to battle with his rebellious art, seemed to\\nhave gone; a reaction of indifference and laziness had set in, and he\\nvegetated delightfully, like one who is recovering from some severe\\nillness.\\n\\nBut Christine lived indeed. All the latent passion of her nature burst\\ninto being. She was indeed an amorosa, a child of nature and of love.\\n\\nThus their days passed by and solitude did not prove irksome to them.\\nNo desire for diversion, of paying or receiving visits, as yet made them\\nlook beyond themselves. Such hours as she did not spend near him, she\\nemployed in household cares, turning the house upside down with great\\ncleanings, which Melie executed under her supervision, and falling into\\nfits of reckless activity, which led her to engage in personal combats\\nwith the few saucepans in the kitchen. The garden especially occupied\\nher; provided with pruning shears, careless of the thorns which\\nlacerated her hands, she reaped harvests of roses from the giant\\nrose-bushes; and she gave herself a thorough back-ache in gathering\\nthe apricots, which she sold for two hundred francs to some of the\\nEnglishmen who scoured the district every year. She was very proud of\\nher bargain, and seriously talked of living upon the garden produce.\\nClaude cared less for gardening; he had placed his couch in the large\\ndining-room, transformed into a studio; and he stretched himself upon\\nit, and through the open window watched her sow and plant. There was\\nprofound peace, the certainty that nobody would come, that no ring at\\nthe bell would disturb them at any moment of the day. Claude carried\\nthis fear of coming into contact with people so far as to avoid passing\\nFaucheurâ\\x80\\x99s inn, for he dreaded lest he might run against some party\\nof chums from Paris. Not a soul came, however, throughout the livelong\\nsummer. And every night as they went upstairs, he repeated that, after\\nall, it was deuced lucky.\\n\\nThere was, however, a secret sore in the depths of his happiness.\\nAfter their flight from Paris, Sandoz had learnt their address, and had\\nwritten to ask whether he might go to see Claude, but the latter had\\nnot answered the letter, and so coolness had followed, and the old\\nfriendship seemed dead. Christine was grieved at this, for she realised\\nwell enough that he had broken off all intercourse with his comrades for\\nher sake. She constantly reverted to the subject; she did not want to\\nestrange him from his friends, and indeed she insisted that he should\\ninvite them. But, though he promised to set matters right, he did\\nnothing of the kind. It was all over; what was the use of raking up the\\npast?\\n\\nHowever, money having become scarce towards the latter days of July, he\\nwas obliged to go to Paris to sell Papa Malgras half a dozen of his old\\nstudies, and Christine, on accompanying him to the station, made him\\nsolemnly promise that he would go to see Sandoz. In the evening she was\\nthere again, at the Bonnieres Station, waiting for him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, did you see him? did you embrace each other?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe began walking by her side in silent embarrassment. Then he answered\\nin a husky voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No; I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon, sorely distressed, with two big tears welling to her eyes,\\nshe replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You grieve me very much indeed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, as they were walking under the trees, he kissed her, crying also,\\nand begging her not to make him sadder still. â\\x80\\x98Could people alter life?\\nDid it not suffice that they were happy together?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDuring the earlier months they only once met some strangers. This\\noccurred a little above Bennecourt, in the direction of La Roche-Guyon.\\nThey were strolling along a deserted, wooded lane, one of those\\ndelightful dingle paths of the region, when, at a turning, they came\\nupon three middle-class people out for a walk--father, mother, and\\ndaughter. It precisely happened that, believing themselves to be quite\\nalone, Claude and Christine had passed their arms round each otherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwaists; she, bending towards him, was offering her lips; while he\\nlaughingly protruded his; and their surprise was so sudden that they did\\nnot change their attitude, but, still clasped together, advanced at the\\nsame slow pace. The amazed family remained transfixed against one of\\nthe side banks, the father stout and apoplectic, the mother as thin as\\na knife-blade, and the daughter, a mere shadow, looking like a sick bird\\nmoulting--all three of them ugly, moreover, and but scantily provided\\nwith the vitiated blood of their race. They looked disgraceful amidst\\nthe throbbing life of nature, beneath the glorious sun. And all at once\\nthe sorry girl, who with stupefied eyes thus watched love passing by,\\nwas pushed off by her father, dragged along by her mother, both beside\\nthemselves, exasperated by the sight of that embrace, and asking whether\\nthere was no longer any country police, while, still without hurrying,\\nthe lovers went off triumphantly in their glory.\\n\\nClaude, however, was wondering and searching his memory. Where had he\\npreviously seen those heads, so typical of bourgeois degeneracy, those\\nflattened, crabbed faces reeking of millions earned at the expense of\\nthe poor? It was assuredly in some important circumstance of his life.\\nAnd all at once he remembered; they were the Margaillans, the man was\\nthat building contractor whom Dubuche had promenaded through the Salon\\nof the Rejected, and who had laughed in front of his picture with the\\nroaring laugh of a fool. A couple of hundred steps further on, as he and\\nChristine emerged from the lane and found themselves in front of a large\\nestate, where a big white building stood, girt with fine trees, they\\nlearnt from an old peasant woman that La Richaudiere, as it was called,\\nhad belonged to the Margaillans for three years past. They had paid\\nfifteen hundred thousand francs for it, and had just spent more than a\\nmillion in improvements.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That part of the country wonâ\\x80\\x99t see much of us in future,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude,\\nas they returned to Bennecourt. â\\x80\\x98Those monsters spoil the landscape.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTowards the end of the summer, an important event changed the current\\nof their lives. Christine was _enceinte_. At first, both she and Claude\\nfelt amazed and worried. Now for the first time they seemed to dread\\nsome terrible complications in their life. Later on, however, they\\ngradually grew accustomed to the thought of what lay before them and\\nmade all necessary preparations. But the winter proved a terribly\\ninclement one, and Christine was compelled to remain indoors, whilst\\nClaude went walking all alone over the frost-bound, clanking roads.\\nAnd he, finding himself in solitude during these walks, after months of\\nconstant companionship, wondered at the way his life had turned, against\\nhis own will, as it were. He had never wished for home life even with\\nher; had he been consulted, he would have expressed his horror of it;\\nit had come about, however, and could not be undone, for--without\\nmentioning the child--he was one of those who lack the courage to break\\noff. This fate had evidently been in store for him, he felt; he had been\\ndestined to succumb to the first woman who did not feel ashamed of him.\\nThe hard ground resounded beneath his wooden-soled shoes, and the blast\\nfroze the current of his reverie, which lingered on vague thoughts, on\\nhis luck of having, at any rate, met with a good and honest girl, on how\\ncruelly he would have suffered had it been otherwise. And then his love\\ncame back to him; he hurried home to take Christine in his trembling\\narms as if he had been in danger of losing her.\\n\\nThe child, a boy, was born about the middle of February, and at once\\nbegan to revolutionise the home, for Christine, who had shown herself\\nsuch an active housewife, proved to be a very awkward nurse. She failed\\nto become motherly, despite her kind heart and her distress at the sight\\nof the slightest pimple. She soon grew weary, gave in, and called for\\nMelie, who only made matters worse by her gaping stupidity. The father\\nhad to come to the rescue, and proved still more awkward than the two\\nwomen. The discomfort which needlework had caused Christine of old, her\\nwant of aptitude as regards the usual occupations of her sex, revived\\namid the cares that the baby required. The child was ill-kept, and grew\\nup anyhow in the garden, or in the large rooms left untidy in sheer\\ndespair, amidst broken toys, uncleanliness and destruction. And when\\nmatters became too bad altogether, Christine could only throw herself\\nupon the neck of the man she loved. She was pre-eminently an amorosa and\\nwould have sacrificed her son for his father twenty times over.\\n\\nIt was at this period, however, that Claude resumed work a little. The\\nwinter was drawing to a close; he did not know how to spend the bright\\nsunny mornings, since Christine could no longer go out before mid-day\\non account of Jacques, whom they had named thus after his maternal\\ngrandfather, though they neglected to have him christened. Claude worked\\nin the garden, at first, in a random way: made a rough sketch of the\\nlines of apricot trees, roughed out the giant rose-bushes, composed some\\nbits of â\\x80\\x98still life,â\\x80\\x99 out of four apples, a bottle, and a stoneware\\njar, disposed on a table-napkin. This was only to pass his time. But\\nafterwards he warmed to his work; the idea of painting a figure in\\nthe full sunlight ended by haunting him; and from that moment his wife\\nbecame his victim, she herself agreeable enough, offering herself,\\nfeeling happy at affording him pleasure, without as yet understanding\\nwhat a terrible rival she was giving herself in art. He painted her a\\nscore of times, dressed in white, in red, amidst the verdure, standing,\\nwalking, or reclining on the grass, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat,\\nor bare-headed, under a parasol, the cherry-tinted silk of which\\nsteeped her features in a pinky glow. He never felt wholly satisfied;\\nhe scratched out the canvases after two or three sittings, and at once\\nbegan them afresh, obstinately sticking to the same subject. Only a few\\nstudies, incomplete, but charmingly indicated in a vigorous style,\\nwere saved from the palette-knife, and hung against the walls of the\\ndining-room.\\n\\nAnd after Christine it became Jacquesâ\\x80\\x99 turn to pose. They stripped\\nhim to the skin, like a little St. John the Baptist, on warm days, and\\nstretched him on a blanket, where he was told not to stir. But devil a\\nbit could they make him keep still. Getting frisky, in the sunlight, he\\ncrowed and kicked with his tiny pink feet in the air, rolling about and\\nturning somersaults. The father, after laughing, became angry, and swore\\nat the tiresome mite, who would not keep quiet for a minute. Who ever\\nheard of trifling with painting? Then the mother made big eyes at the\\nlittle one, and held him while the painter quickly sketched an arm or a\\nleg. Claude obstinately kept at it for weeks, tempted as he felt by the\\npretty tones of that childish skin. It was not as a father, but as an\\nartist, that he gloated over the boy as the subject for a masterpiece,\\nblinking his eyes the while, and dreaming of some wonderful picture he\\nwould paint. And he renewed the experiment again and again, watching the\\nlad for days, and feeling furious when the little scamp would not go to\\nsleep at times when he, Claude, might so well have painted him.\\n\\nOne day, when Jacques was sobbing, refusing to keep still, Christine\\ngently remarked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My dear, you tire the poor pet.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this Claude burst forth, full of remorse:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98After all! you are right; Iâ\\x80\\x99m a fool with this painting of mine.\\nChildren are not intended for that sort of thing.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe spring and summer sped by amidst great quietude. They went out less\\noften; they had almost given up the boat, which finished rotting against\\nthe bank, for it was quite a job to take the little one with them\\namong the islets. But they often strolled along the banks of the Seine,\\nwithout, however, going farther afield than a thousand yards or so.\\nClaude, tired of the everlasting views in the garden, now attempted some\\nsketches by the river-side, and on such days Christine went to fetch him\\nwith the child, sitting down to watch him paint, until they all three\\nreturned home with flagging steps, beneath the ashen dusk of waning\\ndaylight. One afternoon Claude was surprised to see Christine bring with\\nher the old album which she had used as a young girl. She joked about\\nit, and explained that to sit behind him like that had roused in her a\\nwish to work herself. Her voice was a little unsteady as she spoke; the\\ntruth was that she felt a longing to share his labour, since this labour\\ntook him away from her more and more each day. She drew and ventured\\nto wash in two or three water-colours in the careful style of a\\nschool-girl. Then, discouraged by his smiles, feeling that no community\\nof ideas would be arrived at on that ground, she once more put her album\\naside, making him promise to give her some lessons in painting whenever\\nhe should have time.\\n\\nBesides, she thought his more recent pictures very pretty. After that\\nyear of rest in the open country, in the full sunlight, he painted\\nwith fresh and clearer vision, as it were, with a more harmonious and\\nbrighter colouring. He had never before been able to treat reflections\\nso skilfully, or possessed a more correct perception of men and things\\nsteeped in diffuse light. And henceforth, won over by that feast of\\ncolours, she would have declared it all capital if he would only have\\ncondescended to finish his work a little more, and if she had not\\nremained nonplussed now and then before a mauve ground or a blue tree,\\nwhich upset all her preconceived notions of colour. One day when she\\nventured upon a bit of criticism, precisely about an azure-tinted\\npoplar, he made her go to nature and note for herself the delicate\\nbluishness of the foliage. It was true enough, the tree was blue; but\\nin her inmost heart she did not surrender, and condemned reality; there\\nought not to be any blue trees in nature.\\n\\nShe no longer spoke but gravely of the studies hanging in the\\ndining-room. Art was returning into their lives, and it made her muse.\\nWhen she saw him go off with his bag, his portable easel, and his\\nsunshade, it often happened that she flung herself upon his neck,\\nasking:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You love me, say?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How silly you are! Why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t I love you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then kiss me, since you love me, kiss me a great deal, a great deal.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen accompanying him as far as the road, she added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And mind you work; you know that I have never prevented you from\\nworking. Go, go; I am very pleased when you work.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnxiety seemed to seize hold of Claude, when the autumn of the second\\nyear tinged the leaves yellow, and ushered in the cold weather. The\\nseason happened to be abominable; a fortnight of pouring rain kept him\\nidle at home; and then fog came at every moment, hindering his work. He\\nsat in front of the fire, out of sorts; he never spoke of Paris, but\\nthe city rose up over yonder, on the horizon, the winter city, with its\\ngaslamps flaring already at five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, its gatherings of friends,\\nspurring each other on to emulation, and its life of ardent production,\\nwhich even the frosts of December could not slacken. He went there\\nthrice in one month, on the pretext of seeing Malgras, to whom he had,\\nagain, sold a few small pictures. He no longer avoided passing in front\\nof Faucheurâ\\x80\\x99s inn; he even allowed himself to be waylaid at times by old\\nPorrette, and to accept a glass of white wine at the inn, and his glance\\nscoured the room as if, despite the season, he had been looking for some\\ncomrades of yore, who had arrived there, perchance, that morning. He\\nlingered as if awaiting them; then, in despair at his solitude, he\\nreturned home, stifling with all that was fermenting within him, ill at\\nhaving nobody to whom he might shout the thoughts which made his brain\\nalmost burst.\\n\\nHowever, the winter went by, and Claude had the consolation of being\\nable to paint some lovely snow scenes. A third year was beginning, when,\\ntowards the close of May, an unexpected meeting filled him with emotion.\\nHe had that morning climbed up to the plateau to find a subject, having\\nat last grown tired of the banks of the Seine; and at the bend of a\\nroad he stopped short in amazement on seeing Dubuche, in a silk hat, and\\ncarefully-buttoned frock coat, coming towards him, between the double\\nrow of elder hedges.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! is it you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe architect stammered from sheer vexation:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, I am going to pay a visit. Itâ\\x80\\x99s confoundedly idiotic in the\\ncountry, eh? But it canâ\\x80\\x99t be helped. There are certain things oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nobliged to do. And you live near here, eh? I knew--that is to say, I\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t. I had been told something about it, but I thought it was on the\\nopposite side, farther down.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, very much moved at seeing him, helped him out of his difficulty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right, all right, old man, there is no need to apologise. I am the\\nmost guilty party. Ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s a long while since we saw one another! If\\nyou knew what a thump my heart gave when I saw your nose appear from\\nbehind the leaves!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen he took his arm and accompanied him, giggling with pleasure, while\\nthe other, in his constant worry about his future, which always made him\\ntalk about himself, at once began speaking of his prospects. He had just\\nbecome a first-class pupil at the School, after securing the regulation\\nâ\\x80\\x98honourable mentions,â\\x80\\x99 with infinite trouble. But his success left\\nhim as perplexed as ever. His parents no longer sent him a penny, they\\nwailed about their poverty so much that he might have to support them\\nin his turn. He had given up the idea of competing for the Prix de Rome,\\nfeeling certain of being beaten in the effort, and anxious to earn his\\nliving. And he was weary already; sick at scouring the town, at earning\\ntwenty-five sous an hour from ignorant architects, who treated him\\nlike a hodman. What course should he adopt? How was he to guess at the\\nshortest route? He might leave the School; he would get a lift from his\\nmaster, the influential Dequersonniere, who liked him for his docility\\nand diligence; only what a deal of trouble and uncertainty there would\\nstill be before him! And he bitterly complained of the Government\\nschools, where one slaved away for years, and which did not even provide\\na position for all those whom they cast upon the pavement.\\n\\nSuddenly he stopped in the middle of the path. The elder hedges were\\nleading to an open plain, and La Richaudiere appeared amid its lofty\\ntrees.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hold hard! of course,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, â\\x80\\x98I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t thought about\\nit--youâ\\x80\\x99re going to that shanty. Oh! the baboons; thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot of ugly\\nmugs, if you like!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDubuche, looking vexed at this outburst of artistic feeling, protested\\nstiffly. â\\x80\\x98All the same, Papa Margaillan, idiot as he seems to you, is\\na first-rate man of business. You should see him in his building-yards,\\namong the houses he runs up, as active as the very fiend, showing\\nmarvellous good management, and a wonderful scent as to the right\\nstreets to build and what materials to buy! Besides, one does not earn\\nmillions without becoming a gentleman. And then, too, it would be very\\nsilly of me not to be polite to a man who can be useful to me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhile talking, he barred the narrow path, preventing his friend from\\nadvancing further--no doubt from a fear of being compromised by being\\nseen in his company, and in order to make him understand that they ought\\nto separate there.\\n\\nClaude was on the point of inquiring about their comrades in Paris, but\\nhe kept silent. Not even a word was said respecting Christine, and he\\nwas reluctantly deciding to quit Dubuche, holding out his hand to take\\nleave, when, in spite of himself, this question fell from his quivering\\nlips:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And is Sandoz all right?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, heâ\\x80\\x99s pretty well. I seldom see him. He spoke to me about you last\\nmonth. He is still grieved at your having shown us the door.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But I didnâ\\x80\\x99t show you the door,â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Claude, beside himself.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come and see me, I beg of you. I shall be so glad!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right, then, weâ\\x80\\x99ll come. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell him to come, I give you my\\nword--good-bye, old man, good-bye; Iâ\\x80\\x99m in a hurry.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd Dubuche went off towards La Richaudiere, whilst Claude watched\\nhis figure dwindle as he crossed the cultivated plain, until nothing\\nremained but the shiny silk of his hat and the black spot of his coat.\\nThe young man returned home slowly, his heart bursting with nameless\\nsadness. However, he said nothing about this meeting to Christine.\\n\\nA week later she had gone to Faucheurâ\\x80\\x99s to buy a pound of vermicelli,\\nand was lingering on her way back, gossiping with a neighbour, with\\nher child on her arm, when a gentleman who alighted from the ferry-boat\\napproached and asked her:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Does not Monsieur Claude Lantier live near here?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was taken aback, and simply answered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, monsieur; if youâ\\x80\\x99ll kindly follow me--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey walked on side by side for about a hundred yards. The stranger, who\\nseemed to know her, had glanced at her with a good-natured smile; but as\\nshe hurried on, trying to hide her embarrassment by looking very grave,\\nhe remained silent. She opened the door and showed the visitor into the\\nstudio, exclaiming:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Claude, here is somebody for you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen a loud cry rang out; the two men were already in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s arms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, my good old Pierre! how kind of you to come! And Dubuche?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He was prevented at the last moment by some business, and he sent me a\\ntelegram to go without him.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right, I half expected it; but you are here. By the thunder of\\nheaven, I am glad!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd, turning towards Christine, who was smiling, sharing their delight:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s true, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell you. But the other day I met Dubuche, who was\\ngoing up yonder, to the place where those monsters live--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut he stopped short again, and then with a wild gesture shouted:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m losing my wits, upon my word. You have never spoken to each other,\\nand I leave you there like that. My dear, you see this gentleman? Heâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmy old chum, Pierre Sandoz, whom I love like a brother. And you, my boy;\\nlet me introduce my wife. And you have got to give each other a kiss.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine began to laugh outright, and tendered her cheek heartily.\\nSandoz had pleased her at once with his good-natured air, his sound\\nfriendship, the fatherly sympathy with which he looked at her. Tears of\\nemotion came to her eyes as he kept both her hands in his, saying:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is very good of you to love Claude, and you must love each other\\nalways, for love is, after all, the best thing in life.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, bending to kiss the little one, whom she had on her arm, he added:\\nâ\\x80\\x98So thereâ\\x80\\x99s one already!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhile Christine, preparing lunch, turned the house up-side down, Claude\\nretained Sandoz in the studio. In a few words he told him the whole of\\nthe story, who she was, how they had met each other, and what had led\\nthem to start housekeeping together, and he seemed to be surprised\\nwhen his friend asked him why they did not get married. In faith,\\nwhy? Because they had never even spoken about it, because they would\\ncertainly be neither more nor less happy; in short it was a matter of no\\nconsequence whatever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said the other, â\\x80\\x98it makes no difference to me; but, if she was a\\ngood and honest girl when she came to you, you ought to marry her.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll marry her whenever she likes, old man. Surely I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to\\nleave her in the lurch!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz then began to marvel at the studies hanging on the walls. Ha, the\\nscamp had turned his time to good account! What accuracy of colouring!\\nWhat a dash of real sunlight! And Claude, who listened to him,\\ndelighted, and laughing proudly, was just going to question him about\\nthe comrades in Paris, about what they were all doing, when Christine\\nreappeared, exclaiming: â\\x80\\x98Make haste, the eggs are on the table.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey lunched in the kitchen, and an extraordinary lunch it was; a dish\\nof fried gudgeons after the boiled eggs; then the beef from the soup of\\nthe night before, arranged in salad fashion, with potatoes, and a red\\nherring. It was delicious; there was the pungent and appetising smell\\nof the herring which Melie had upset on the live embers, and the song\\nof the coffee, as it passed, drop by drop, into the pot standing on the\\nrange; and when the dessert appeared--some strawberries just gathered,\\nand a cream cheese from a neighbourâ\\x80\\x99s dairy--they gossiped and gossiped\\nwith their elbows squarely set on the table. In Paris? Well, to tell the\\ntruth, the comrades were doing nothing very original in Paris. And yet\\nthey were fighting their way, jostling each other in order to get first\\nto the front. Of course, the absent ones missed their chance; it was as\\nwell to be there if one did not want to be altogether forgotten. But\\nwas not talent always talent? Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a man always certain to get on\\nwith strength and will? Ah! yes, it was a splendid dream to live in the\\ncountry, to accumulate masterpieces, and then, one day, to crush Paris\\nby simply opening oneâ\\x80\\x99s trunks.\\n\\nIn the evening, when Claude accompanied Sandoz to the station, the\\nlatter said to him:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That reminds me, I wanted to tell you something. I think I am going to\\nget married.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter burst out laughing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, you wag, now I understand why you gave me a lecture this morning.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhile waiting for the train to arrive, they went on chatting. Sandoz\\nexplained his ideas on marriage, which, in middle-class fashion, he\\nconsidered an indispensable condition for good work, substantial orderly\\nlabour, among great modern producers. The theory of woman being a\\ndestructive creature--one who killed an artist, pounded his heart, and\\nfed upon his brain--was a romantic idea against which facts protested.\\nBesides, as for himself, he needed an affection that would prove the\\nguardian of his tranquillity, a loving home, where he might shut himself\\nup, so as to devote his whole life to the huge work which he ever dreamt\\nof. And he added that everything depended upon a manâ\\x80\\x99s choice--that\\nhe believed he had found what he had been looking for, an orphan,\\nthe daughter of petty tradespeople, without a penny, but handsome and\\nintelligent. For the last six months, after resigning his clerkship, he\\nhad embraced journalism, by which he gained a larger income. He had just\\nmoved his mother to a small house at Batignolles, where the three would\\nlive together--two women to love him, and he strong enough to provide\\nfor the household.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Get married, old man,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude. â\\x80\\x98One should act according to oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfeelings. And good-bye, for hereâ\\x80\\x99s your train. Donâ\\x80\\x99t forget your promise\\nto come and see us again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz returned very often. He dropped in at odd times whenever his\\nnewspaper work allowed him, for he was still free, as he was not to\\nbe married till the autumn. Those were happy days, whole afternoons\\nof mutual confidences when all their old determination to secure fame\\nrevived.\\n\\nOne day, while Sandoz was alone with Claude on an island of the Seine,\\nboth of them lying there with their eyes fixed on the sky, he told the\\npainter of his vast ambition, confessed himself aloud.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Journalism, let me tell you, is only a battle-ground. A man must live,\\nand he has to fight to do so. Then, again, that wanton, the Press,\\ndespite the unpleasant phases of the profession, is after all a\\ntremendous power, a resistless weapon in the hands of a fellow with\\nconvictions. But if I am obliged to avail myself of journalism, I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmean to grow grey in it! Oh, dear no! And, besides, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found what I\\nwanted, a machine thatâ\\x80\\x99ll crush one with work, something Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to\\nplunge into, perhaps never to come out of it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSilence reigned amid the foliage, motionless in the dense heat. He\\nresumed speaking more slowly and in jerky phrases:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98To study man as he is, not man the metaphysical puppet but\\nphysiological man, whose nature is determined by his surroundings,\\nand to show all his organism in full play. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s my idea! Is it not\\nfarcical that some should constantly and exclusively study the functions\\nof the brain on the pretext that the brain alone is the noble part of\\nour organism? Thought, thought, confound it all! thought is the product\\nof the whole body. Let them try to make a brain think by itself alone;\\nsee what becomes of the nobleness of the brain when the stomach is\\nailing! No, no, itâ\\x80\\x99s idiotic; there is no philosophy nor science in\\nit! We are positivists, evolutionists, and yet we are to stick to the\\nliterary lay-figures of classic times, and continue disentangling the\\ntangled locks of pure reason! He who says psychologist says traitor to\\ntruth. Besides, psychology, physiology, it all signifies nothing. The\\none has become blended with the other, and both are but one nowadays,\\nthe mechanism of man leading to the sum total of his functions. Ah, the\\nformula is there, our modern revolution has no other basis; it means the\\ncertain death of old society, the birth of a new one, and necessarily\\nthe upspringing of a new art in a new soil. Yes, people will see what\\nliterature will sprout forth for the coming century of science and\\ndemocracy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis cry uprose and was lost in the immense vault of heaven. Not a breath\\nstirred; there was nought but the silent ripple of the river past the\\nwillows. And Sandoz turned abruptly towards his companion, and said to\\nhim, face to face:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So I have found what I wanted for myself. Oh, it isnâ\\x80\\x99t much, a little\\ncorner of study only, but one that should be sufficient for a manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlife, even when his ambition is over-vast. I am going to take a family,\\nand I shall study its members, one by one, whence they come, whither\\nthey go, how they re-act one upon another--in short, I shall have\\nmankind in a small compass, the way in which mankind grows and behaves.\\nOn the other hand, I shall set my men and women in some given period\\nof history, which will provide me with the necessary surroundings and\\ncircumstances,--you understand, eh? a series of books, fifteen, twenty\\nbooks, episodes that will cling together, although each will have a\\nseparate framework, a series of novels with which I shall be able to\\nbuild myself a house for my old days, if they donâ\\x80\\x99t crush me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe fell on his back again, spread out his arms on the grass, as if he\\nwanted to sink into the earth, laughing and joking all the while.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, beneficent earth, take me unto thee, thou who art our common\\nmother, our only source of life! thou the eternal, the immortal one, in\\nwhom circulates the soul of the world, the sap that spreads even into\\nthe stones, and makes the trees themselves our big, motionless brothers!\\nYes, I wish to lose myself in thee; it is thou that I feel beneath my\\nlimbs, clasping and inflaming me; thou alone shalt appear in my work\\nas the primary force, the means and the end, the immense ark in which\\neverything becomes animated with the breath of every being!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThough begun as mere pleasantry, with all the bombast of lyrical\\nemphasis, the invocation terminated in a cry of ardent conviction,\\nquivering with profound poetical emotion, and Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s eyes grew moist;\\nand, to hide how much he felt moved, he added, roughly, with a sweeping\\ngesture that took in the whole scene around:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How idiotic it is! a soul for every one of us, when there is that big\\nsoul there!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, who had disappeared amid the grass, had not stirred. After a\\nfresh spell of silence he summed up everything:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s it, old boy! Run them through, all of them. Only youâ\\x80\\x99ll get\\ntrounced.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, rising up and stretching himself, â\\x80\\x98my bones are too\\nhard. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll smash their own wrists. Letâ\\x80\\x99s go back; I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to\\nmiss the train.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine had taken a great liking to him, seeing him so robust and\\nupright in his doings, and she plucked up courage at last to ask a\\nfavour of him: that of standing godfather to Jacques. True, she never\\nset foot in church now, but why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t the lad be treated according\\nto custom? What influenced her above all was the idea of giving the boy\\na protector in this godfather, whom she found so serious and sensible,\\neven amidst the exuberance of his strength. Claude expressed surprise,\\nbut gave his consent with a shrug of the shoulders. And the christening\\ntook place; they found a godmother, the daughter of a neighbour, and\\nthey made a feast of it, eating a lobster, which was brought from Paris.\\n\\nThat very day, as they were saying good-bye, Christine took Sandoz\\naside, and said, in an imploring voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do come again soon, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you? He is bored.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, Claude had fits of profound melancholy. He abandoned his work,\\nwent out alone, and prowled in spite of himself about Faucheurâ\\x80\\x99s inn,\\nat the spot where the ferry-boat landed its passengers, as if ever\\nexpecting to see all Paris come ashore there. He had Paris on the brain;\\nhe went there every month and returned desolate, unable to work. Autumn\\ncame, then winter, a very wet and muddy winter, and he spent it in\\na state of morose torpidity, bitter even against Sandoz, who, having\\nmarried in October, could no longer come to Bennecourt so often. Claude\\nonly seemed to wake up at each of the otherâ\\x80\\x99s visits; deriving a weekâ\\x80\\x99s\\nexcitement from them, and never ceasing to comment feverishly about\\nthe news brought from yonder. He, who formerly had hidden his regret of\\nParis, nowadays bewildered Christine with the way in which he chatted\\nto her from morn till night about things she was quite ignorant of, and\\npeople she had never seen. When Jacques fell asleep, there were endless\\ncomments between the parents as they sat by the fireside. Claude grew\\npassionate, and Christine had to give her opinion and to pronounce\\njudgment on all sorts of matters.\\n\\nWas not Gagniere an idiot for stultifying his brain with music, he who\\nmight have developed so conscientious a talent as a landscape painter?\\nIt was said that he was now taking lessons on the piano from a young\\nlady--the idea, at his age! What did she, Christine, think of it? And\\nJory had been trying to get into the good graces of Irma Becot again,\\never since she had secured that little house in the Rue de Moscou!\\nChristine knew those two; two jades who well went together, werenâ\\x80\\x99t\\nthey? But the most cunning of the whole lot was Fagerolles, to whom he,\\nClaude, would tell a few plain truths and no mistake, when he met him.\\nWhat! the turn-coat had competed for the Prix de Rome, which, of course,\\nhe had managed to miss. To think of it. That fellow did nothing but jeer\\nat the School, and talked about knocking everything down, yet took part\\nin official competitions! Ah, there was no doubt but that the itching to\\nsucceed, the wish to pass over oneâ\\x80\\x99s comrades and be hailed by idiots,\\nimpelled some people to very dirty tricks. Surely Christine did not mean\\nto stick up for him, eh? She was not sufficiently a philistine to defend\\nhim. And when she had agreed with everything Claude said, he always\\ncame back with nervous laughter to the same story--which he thought\\nexceedingly comical--the story of Mahoudeau and Chaine, who, between\\nthem, had killed little Jabouille, the husband of Mathilde, that\\ndreadful herbalist woman. Yes, killed the poor consumptive fellow with\\nkindness one evening when he had had a fainting fit, and when, on being\\ncalled in by the woman, they had taken to rubbing him with so much\\nvigour that he had remained dead in their hands.\\n\\nAnd if Christine failed to look amused at all this, Claude rose up and\\nsaid, in a churlish voice: â\\x80\\x98Oh, you; nothing will make you laugh--letâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngo to bed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe still adored her, but she no longer sufficed. Another torment had\\ninvincibly seized hold of him--the passion for art, the thirst for fame.\\n\\nIn the spring, Claude, who, with an affectation of disdain, had sworn he\\nwould never again exhibit, began to worry a great deal about the Salon.\\nWhenever he saw Sandoz he questioned him about what the comrades were\\ngoing to send. On the opening day he went to Paris and came back the\\nsame evening, stern and trembling. There was only a bust by Mahoudeau,\\nsaid he, good enough, but of no importance. A small landscape by\\nGagniere, admitted among the ruck, was also of a pretty sunny tone. Then\\nthere was nothing else, nothing but Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 picture--an actress in\\nfront of her looking-glass painting her face. He had not mentioned it at\\nfirst; but he now spoke of it with indignant laughter. What a trickster\\nthat Fagerolles was! Now that he had missed his prize he was no longer\\nafraid to exhibit--he threw the School overboard; but you should have\\nseen how skilfully he managed it, what compromises he effected, painting\\nin a style which aped the audacity of truth without possessing one\\noriginal merit. And it would be sure to meet with success, the bourgeois\\nwere only too fond of being titillated while the artist pretended to\\nhustle them. Ah! it was time indeed for a true artist to appear in that\\nmournful desert of a Salon, amid all the knaves and the fools. And, by\\nheavens, what a place might be taken there!\\n\\nChristine, who listened while he grew angry, ended by faltering:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you liked, we might go back to Paris.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who was talking of that?â\\x80\\x99 he shouted. â\\x80\\x98One can never say a word to you\\nbut you at once jump to false conclusions.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSix weeks afterwards he heard some news that occupied his mind for\\na week. His friend Dubuche was going to marry Mademoiselle Regine\\nMargaillan, the daughter of the owner of La Richaudiere. It was\\nan intricate story, the details of which surprised and amused him\\nexceedingly. First of all, that cur Dubuche had managed to hook a medal\\nfor a design of a villa in a park, which he had exhibited; that of\\nitself was already sufficiently amusing, as it was said that the drawing\\nhad been set on its legs by his master, Dequersonniere, who had quietly\\nobtained this medal for him from the jury over which he presided.\\nThen the best of it was that this long-awaited reward had decided the\\nmarriage. Ah! it would be nice trafficking if medals were now awarded to\\nsettle needy pupils in rich families! Old Margaillan, like all parvenus,\\nhad set his heart upon having a son-in-law who could help him, by\\nbringing authentic diplomas and fashionable clothes into the business;\\nand for some time past he had had his eyes on that young man, that\\npupil of the School of Arts, whose notes were excellent, who was so\\npersevering, and so highly recommended by his masters. The medal aroused\\nhis enthusiasm; he at once gave the young fellow his daughter and took\\nhim as a partner, who would soon increase his millions now lying idle,\\nsince he knew all that was needful in order to build properly. Besides,\\nby this arrangement poor Regine, always low-spirited and ailing, would\\nat least have a husband in perfect health.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, a man must be fond of money to marry that wretched flayed\\nkitten,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Claude.\\n\\nAnd as Christine compassionately took the girlâ\\x80\\x99s part, he added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But I am not down upon her. So much the better if the marriage does not\\nfinish her off. She is certainly not to be blamed, if her father,\\nthe ex-stonemason, had the stupid ambition to marry a girl of the\\nmiddle-classes. Her father, you know, has the vitiated blood of\\ngenerations of drunkards in his veins, and her mother comes of a stock\\nin the last stages of degeneracy. Ah! they may coin money, but that\\ndoesnâ\\x80\\x99t prevent them from being excrescences on the face of the earth!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was growing ferocious, and Christine had to clasp him in her arms and\\nkiss him, and laugh, to make him once more the good-natured fellow\\nof earlier days. Then, having calmed down, he professed to understand\\nthings, saying that he approved of the marriages of his old chums. It\\nwas true enough, all three had taken wives unto themselves. How funny\\nlife was!\\n\\nOnce more the summer drew to an end; it was the fourth spent at\\nBennecourt. In reality they could never be happier than now; life was\\npeaceful and cheap in the depths of that village. Since they had been\\nthere they had never lacked money. Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s thousand francs a year and\\nthe proceeds of the few pictures he had sold had sufficed for their\\nwants; they had even put something by, and had bought some house linen.\\nOn the other hand, little Jacques, by now two years and a half old, got\\non admirably in the country. From morning till night he rolled about\\nthe garden, ragged and dirt-begrimed, but growing as he listed in robust\\nruddy health. His mother often did not know where to take hold of him\\nwhen she wished to wash him a bit. However, when she saw him eat and\\nsleep well she did not trouble much; she reserved her anxious affection\\nfor her big child of an artist, whose despondency filled her with\\nanguish. The situation grew worse each day, and although they lived on\\npeacefully without any cause for grief, they, nevertheless, drifted to\\nmelancholy, to a discomfort that showed itself in constant irritation.\\n\\nIt was all over with their first delights of country life. Their rotten\\nboat, staved in, had gone to the bottom of the Seine. Besides, they did\\nnot even think of availing themselves of the skiff that the Faucheurs\\nhad placed at their disposal. The river bored them; they had grown too\\nlazy to row. They repeated their exclamations of former times respecting\\ncertain delightful nooks in the islets, but without ever being tempted\\nto return and gaze upon them. Even the walks by the river-side had lost\\ntheir charm--one was broiled there in summer, and one caught cold there\\nin winter. And as for the plateau, the vast stretch of land planted\\nwith apple trees that overlooked the village, it became like a distant\\ncountry, something too far off for one to be silly enough to risk oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlegs there. Their house also annoyed them--that barracks where they had\\nto take their meals amid the greasy refuse of the kitchen, where their\\nroom seemed a meeting-place for the winds from every point of the\\ncompass. As a finishing stroke of bad luck, the apricots had failed that\\nyear, and the finest of the giant rose-bushes, which were very old, had\\nbeen smitten with some canker or other and died. How sorely time and\\nhabit wore everything away! How eternal nature herself seemed to age\\namidst that satiated weariness. But the worst was that the painter\\nhimself was getting disgusted with the country, no longer finding a\\nsingle subject to arouse his enthusiasm, but scouring the fields with\\na mournful tramp, as if the whole place were a void, whose life he had\\nexhausted without leaving as much as an overlooked tree, an unforeseen\\neffect of light to interest him. No, it was over, frozen, he should\\nnever again be able to paint anything worth looking at in that\\nconfounded country!\\n\\nOctober came with its rain-laden sky. On one of the first wet evenings\\nClaude flew into a passion because dinner was not ready. He turned that\\ngoose of a Melie out of the house and clouted Jacques, who got between\\nhis legs. Whereupon, Christine, crying, kissed him and said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s go, oh, let us go back to Paris.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe disengaged himself, and cried in an angry voice: â\\x80\\x98What, again! Never!\\ndo you hear me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do it for my sake,â\\x80\\x99 she said, warmly. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s I who ask it of you, itâ\\x80\\x99s I\\nthat youâ\\x80\\x99ll please.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, are you tired of being here, then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, I shall die if we stay here much longer; and, besides I want you\\nto work. I feel quite certain that your place is there. It would be a\\ncrime for you to bury yourself here any longer.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, leave me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was quivering. On the horizon Paris was calling him, the Paris of\\nwinter-tide which was being lighted up once more. He thought he could\\nhear from where he stood the great efforts that his comrades were\\nmaking, and, in fancy, he returned thither in order that they might not\\ntriumph without him, in order that he might become their chief again,\\nsince not one of them had strength or pride enough to be such. And amid\\nthis hallucination, amid the desire he felt to hasten to Paris, he\\nyet persisted in refusing to do so, from a spirit of involuntary\\ncontradiction, which arose, though he could not account for it, from his\\nvery entrails. Was it the fear with which the bravest quivers, the mute\\nstruggle of happiness seeking to resist the fatality of destiny?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen,â\\x80\\x99 said Christine, excitedly. â\\x80\\x98I shall get our boxes ready, and\\ntake you away.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFive days later, after packing and sending their chattels to the\\nrailway, they started for Paris.\\n\\nClaude was already on the road with little Jacques, when Christine\\nfancied that she had forgotten something. She returned alone to the\\nhouse; and finding it quite bare and empty, she burst out crying. It\\nseemed as if something were being torn from her, as if she were leaving\\nsomething of herself behind--what, she could not say. How willingly\\nwould she have remained! how ardent was her wish to live there\\nalways--she who had just insisted on that departure, that return to the\\ncity of passion where she scented the presence of a rival. However, she\\ncontinued searching for what she lacked, and in front of the kitchen she\\nended by plucking a rose, a last rose, which the cold was turning brown.\\nAnd then she slowly closed the gate upon the deserted garden.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\nWHEN Claude found himself once more on the pavement of Paris he was\\nseized with a feverish longing for hubbub and motion, a desire to gad\\nabout, scour the whole city, and see his chums. He was off the moment\\nhe awoke, leaving Christine to get things shipshape by herself in the\\nstudio which they had taken in the Rue de Douai, near the Boulevard de\\nClichy. In this way, on the second day of his arrival, he dropped in at\\nMahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, in the chill, grey November\\ndawn which had barely risen.\\n\\nHowever, the shop in the Rue du Cherche-Midi, which the sculptor still\\noccupied, was open, and Mahoudeau himself, half asleep, with a white\\nface, was shivering as he took down the shutters.\\n\\nAh! itâ\\x80\\x99s you. The devil! youâ\\x80\\x99ve got into early habits in the country. So\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s settled--you are back for good?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes; since the day before yesterday.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s all right. Then we shall see something of each other. Come in;\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s sharp this morning.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Claude felt colder in the shop than outside. He kept the collar\\nof his coat turned up, and plunged his hands deep into his pockets;\\nshivering before the dripping moisture of the bare walls, the muddy\\nheaps of clay, and the pools of water soddening the floor. A blast of\\npoverty had swept into the place, emptying the shelves of the casts\\nfrom the antique, and smashing stands and buckets, which were now held\\ntogether with bits of rope. It was an abode of dirt and disorder,\\na masonâ\\x80\\x99s cellar going to rack and ruin. On the window of the door,\\nbesmeared with whitewash, there appeared in mockery, as it were, a large\\nbeaming sun, roughly drawn with thumb-strokes, and ornamented in the\\ncentre with a face, the mouth of which, describing a semicircle, seemed\\nlikely to burst with laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just wait,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, â\\x80\\x98a fireâ\\x80\\x99s being lighted. These confounded\\nworkshops get chilly directly, with the water from the covering cloths.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt that moment, Claude, on turning round, noticed Chaine on his knees\\nnear the stove, pulling the straw from the seat of an old stool to light\\nthe coals with. He bade him good-morning, but only elicited a muttered\\ngrowl, without succeeding in making him look up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And what are you doing just now, old man?â\\x80\\x99 he asked the sculptor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! nothing of much account. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been a bad year--worse than the last\\none, which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t worth a rap. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a crisis in the church-statue\\nbusiness. Yes, the market for holy wares is bad, and, dash it, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had\\nto tighten my belt! Look, in the meanwhile, Iâ\\x80\\x99m reduced to this.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe thereupon took the linen wraps off a bust, showing a long face still\\nfurther elongated by whiskers, a face full of conceit and infinite\\nimbecility.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s an advocate who lives near by. Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he look repugnant, eh? And\\nthe way he worries me about being very careful with his mouth. However,\\na fellow must eat, mustnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe certainly had an idea for the Salon; an upright figure, a girl about\\nto bathe, dipping her foot in the water, and shivering at its freshness\\nwith that slight shiver that renders a woman so adorable. He showed\\nClaude a little model of it, which was already cracking, and the painter\\nlooked at it in silence, surprised and displeased at certain concessions\\nhe noticed in it: a sprouting of prettiness from beneath a persistent\\nexaggeration of form, a natural desire to please, blended with a\\nlingering tendency to the colossal. However, Mahoudeau began lamenting;\\nan upright figure was no end of a job. He would want iron braces that\\ncost money, and a modelling frame, which he had not got; in fact, a lot\\nof appliances. So he would, no doubt, decide to model the figure in a\\nrecumbent attitude beside the water.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, what do you say--what do you think of it?â\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not bad,â\\x80\\x99 answered the painter at last. â\\x80\\x98A little bit sentimental, in\\nspite of the strapping limbs; but itâ\\x80\\x99ll all depend upon the execution.\\nAnd put her upright, old man; upright, for there would be nothing in it\\notherwise.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe stove was roaring, and Chaine, still mute, rose up. He prowled about\\nfor a minute, entered the dark back shop, where stood the bed that he\\nshared with Mahoudeau, and then reappeared, his hat on his head, but\\nmore silent, it seemed, than ever. With his awkward peasant fingers he\\nleisurely took up a stick of charcoal and then wrote on the wall: â\\x80\\x98I\\nam going to buy some tobacco; put some more coals in the stove.â\\x80\\x99 And\\nforthwith he went out.\\n\\nClaude, who had watched him writing, turned to the other in amazement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s up?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We no longer speak to one another; we write,â\\x80\\x99 said the sculptor,\\nquietly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Since when?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Since three months ago.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you sleep together?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude burst out laughing. Ah! dash it all! they must have hard nuts.\\nBut what was the reason of this falling-out? Then Mahoudeau vented his\\nrage against that brute of a Chaine! Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he, one night on coming home\\nunexpectedly, found him treating Mathilde, the herbalist woman, to a\\npot of jam? No, he would never forgive him for treating himself in that\\ndirty fashion to delicacies on the sly, while he, Mahoudeau, was half\\nstarving, and eating dry bread. The deuce! one ought to share and share\\nalike.\\n\\nAnd the grudge had now lasted for nearly three months without a break,\\nwithout an explanation. They had arranged their lives accordingly; they\\nhad reduced their strictly necessary intercourse to a series of short\\nphrases charcoaled on the walls. As for the rest, they lived as before,\\nsharing the same bed in the back shop. After all, there was no need for\\nso much talk in life, people managed to understand one another all the\\nsame.\\n\\nWhile filling the stove, Mahoudeau continued to relieve his mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, you may believe me if you like, but when a fellowâ\\x80\\x99s almost\\nstarving it isnâ\\x80\\x99t disagreeable to keep quiet. Yes, one gets numb amidst\\nsilence; itâ\\x80\\x99s like an inside coating that stills the gnawing of the\\nstomach a bit. Ah, that Chaine! You havenâ\\x80\\x99t a notion of his peasant\\nnature. When he had spent his last copper without earning the fortune\\nhe expected by painting, he went into trade, a petty trade, which was to\\nenable him to finish his studies. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t the fellow a sharp â\\x80\\x98un, eh?\\nAnd just listen to his plan. He had some olive oil sent to him from\\nSaint-Firmin, his village, and then he tramped the streets and found\\na market for the oil among well-to-do families from Provence living in\\nParis. Unfortunately, it did not last. He is such a clod-hopper that\\nthey showed him the door on all sides. And as there was a jar of oil\\nleft which nobody would buy, well, old man, we live upon it. Yes, on the\\ndays when we happen to have some bread we dip our bread into it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon he pointed to the jar standing in a corner of the shop. Some\\nof the oil having been spilt, the wall and the floor were darkened by\\nlarge greasy stains.\\n\\nClaude left off laughing. Ah! misery, how discouraging it was! how\\ncould he show himself hard on those whom it crushed? He walked about\\nthe studio, no longer vexed at finding models weakened by concessions\\nto middle-class taste; he even felt tolerant with regard to that hideous\\nbust. But, all at once, he came across a copy that Chaine had made at\\nthe Louvre, a Mantegna, which was marvellously exact in its dryness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, the brute,â\\x80\\x99 he muttered, â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s almost the original; heâ\\x80\\x99s never done\\nanything better than that. Perhaps his only fault is that he was born\\nfour centuries too late.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, as the heat became too great, he took off his over-coat, adding:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s a long while fetching his tobacco.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! his tobacco! I know what that means,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, who had set\\nto work at his bust, finishing the whiskers; â\\x80\\x98he has simply gone next\\ndoor.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! so you still see the herbalist?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, she comes in and out.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe spoke of Mathilde and Chaine without the least show of anger, simply\\nsaying that he thought the woman crazy. Since little Jabouilleâ\\x80\\x99s death\\nshe had become devout again, though this did not prevent her from\\nscandalising the neighbourhood. Her business was going to wreck, and\\nbankruptcy seemed impending. One night, the gas company having cut off\\nthe gas in default of payment, she had come to borrow some of their\\nolive oil, which, after all, would not burn in the lamps. In short, it\\nwas quite a disaster; that mysterious shop, with its fleeting shadows of\\npriestsâ\\x80\\x99 gowns, its discreet confessional-like whispers, and its odour\\nof sacristy incense, was gliding to the abandonment of ruin. And the\\nwretchedness had reached such a point that the dried herbs suspended\\nfrom the ceiling swarmed with spiders, while defunct leeches, which had\\nalready turned green, floated on the tops of the glass jars.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo, here he comes!â\\x80\\x99 resumed the sculptor. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see her arrive at\\nhis heels.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, Chaine came in. He made a great show of drawing a screw of\\ntobacco from his pocket, then filled his pipe, and began to smoke in\\nfront of the stove, remaining obstinately silent, as if there were\\nnobody present. And immediately afterwards Mathilde made her appearance\\nlike a neighbour who comes in to say â\\x80\\x98Good morning.â\\x80\\x99 Claude thought that\\nshe had grown still thinner, but her eyes were all afire, and her mouth\\nwas seemingly enlarged by the loss of two more teeth. The smell of\\naromatic herbs which she always carried in her uncombed hair seemed to\\nhave become rancid. There was no longer the sweetness of camomile,\\nthe freshness of aniseed; she filled the place with a horrid odour of\\npeppermint that seemed to be her very breath.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Already at work!â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98Good morning.â\\x80\\x99 And, without minding\\nClaude, she kissed Mahoudeau. Then, after going to shake hands with the\\npainter in her brazen way, she continued:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What do you think? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve found a box of mallow root, and we will treat\\nourselves to it for breakfast. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that nice of me now! Weâ\\x80\\x99ll share.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thanks,â\\x80\\x99 said the sculptor, â\\x80\\x98it makes my mouth sticky. I prefer to\\nsmoke a pipe.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd, seeing that Claude was putting on his overcoat again, he asked:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you going?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes. I want to get the rust off, and breathe the air of Paris a bit.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAll the same, he stopped for another few minutes watching Chaine and\\nMathilde, who stuffed themselves with mallow root, each taking a piece\\nby turns. And though he had been warned, he was again amazed when he saw\\nMahoudeau take up the stick of charcoal and write on the wall: â\\x80\\x98Give me\\nthe tobacco you have shoved into your pocket.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWithout a word, Chaine took out the screw and handed it to the sculptor,\\nwho filled his pipe.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see you again soon,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, soon--at any rate, next Thursday, at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOutside, Claude gave an exclamation of surprise on jostling a gentleman,\\nwho stood in front of the herbalistâ\\x80\\x99s peering into the shop.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, Jory! What are you doing there?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJoryâ\\x80\\x99s big pink nose gave a sniff.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I? Nothing. I was passing and looked in,â\\x80\\x99 said he in dismay.\\n\\nThen he decided to laugh, and, as if there were any one to overhear him,\\nlowered his voice to ask:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98She is next door with our friends, isnâ\\x80\\x99t she? All right; letâ\\x80\\x99s be off,\\nquick!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he took the painter with him, telling him all manner of strange\\nstories of that creature Mathilde.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you used to say that she was frightful,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, laughing.\\n\\nJory made a careless gesture. Frightful? No, he had not gone as far as\\nthat. Besides, there might be something attractive about a woman even\\nthough she had a plain face. Then he expressed his surprise at seeing\\nClaude in Paris, and, when he had been fully posted, and learned that\\nthe painter meant to remain there for good, he all at once exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen, I am going to take you with me. You must come to lunch with me\\nat Irmaâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter, taken aback, refused energetically, and gave as a reason\\nthat he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even wearing a frock-coat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What does that matter? On the contrary, it makes it more droll. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nbe delighted. I believe she has a secret partiality for you. She is\\nalways talking about you to us. Come, donâ\\x80\\x99t be a fool. I tell you she\\nexpects me this morning, and we shall be received like princes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe did not relax his hold on Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and they both continued their\\nway towards the Madeleine, talking all the while. As a rule, Jory kept\\nsilent about his many love adventures, just as a drunkard keeps silent\\nabout his potations. But that morning he brimmed over with revelations,\\nchaffed himself and owned to all sorts of scandalous things. After all\\nhe was delighted with existence, his affairs went apace. His miserly\\nfather had certainly cut off the supplies once more, cursing him for\\nobstinately pursuing a scandalous career, but he did not care a rap for\\nthat now; he earned between seven and eight thousand francs a year by\\njournalism, in which he was making his way as a gossipy leader writer\\nand art critic. The noisy days of â\\x80\\x98The Drummer,â\\x80\\x99 the articles at a louis\\napiece, had been left far behind. He was getting steady, wrote for two\\nwidely circulated papers, and although, in his inmost heart he remained\\na sceptical voluptuary, a worshipper of success at any price, he was\\nacquiring importance, and readers began to look upon his opinions as\\nfiats. Swayed by hereditary meanness, he already invested money every\\nmonth in petty speculations, which were only known to himself, for never\\nhad his vices cost him less than nowadays.\\n\\nAs he and Claude reached the Rue de Moscou, he told the painter that\\nit was there that Irma Becot now lived. â\\x80\\x98Oh! she is rolling in wealth,â\\x80\\x99\\nsaid he, â\\x80\\x98paying twenty thousand francs a year rent and talking of\\nbuilding a house which would cost half a million.â\\x80\\x99 Then suddenly pulling\\nup he exclaimed: â\\x80\\x98Come, here we are! In with you, quick!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Claude still objected. His wife was waiting for him to lunch; he\\nreally couldnâ\\x80\\x99t. And Jory was obliged to ring the bell, and then push\\nhim inside the hall, repeating that his excuse would not do; for they\\nwould send the valet to the Rue de Douai to tell his wife. A door opened\\nand they found themselves face to face with Irma Becot, who uttered a\\ncry of surprise as soon as she perceived the painter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! is it you, savage?â\\x80\\x99 she said.\\n\\nShe made him feel at home at once by treating him like an old chum,\\nand, in fact, he saw well enough that she did not even notice his old\\nclothes. He himself was astonished, for he barely recognised her. In\\nthe course of four years she had become a different being; her head was\\nâ\\x80\\x98made upâ\\x80\\x99 with all an actressâ\\x80\\x99s skill, her brow hidden beneath a mass of\\ncurly hair, and her face elongated, by a sheer effort of will, no doubt.\\nAnd from a pale blonde she had become flaringly carrotty; so that a\\nTitianesque creature seemed to have sprung from the little urchin-like\\ngirl of former days. Her house, with all its show of luxury, still had\\nits bald spots. What struck the painter were some good pictures on the\\nwalls, a Courbet, and, above all, an unfinished study by Delacroix. So\\nthis wild, wilful creature was not altogether a fool, although there\\nwas a frightful cat in coloured _biscuit_ standing on a console in the\\ndrawing-room.\\n\\nWhen Jory spoke of sending the valet to his friendâ\\x80\\x99s place, she\\nexclaimed in great surprise:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! you are married?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, yes,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, simply.\\n\\nShe glanced at Jory, who smiled; then she understood, and added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! But why did people tell me that you were a woman-hater? Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfully\\nvexed, you know. I frightened you, donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember, eh? You still\\nthink me very ugly, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? Well, well, weâ\\x80\\x99ll talk about it all some\\nother day.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was the coachman who went to the Rue de Douai with a note from\\nClaude, for the valet had opened the door of the dining-room, to\\nannounce that lunch was served. The repast, a very delicate one, was\\npartaken of in all propriety, under the icy stare of the servant. They\\ntalked about the great building works that were revolutionising Paris;\\nand then discussed the price of land, like middle-class people with\\nmoney to invest. But at dessert, when they were all three alone with the\\ncoffee and liqueurs, which they had decided upon taking there, without\\nleaving the table, they gradually became animated, and dropped into\\ntheir old familiar ways, as if they had met each other at the Cafe\\nBaudequin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, my lads,â\\x80\\x99 said Irma, â\\x80\\x98this is the only real enjoyment, to be jolly\\ntogether and to snap oneâ\\x80\\x99s fingers at other people.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was twisting cigarettes; she had just placed the bottle of\\nchartreuse near her, and had begun to empty it, looking the while very\\nflushed, and lapsing once more to her low street drollery.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So,â\\x80\\x99 continued Jory, who was apologising for not having sent her that\\nmorning a book she wanted, â\\x80\\x98I was going to buy it last night at about\\nten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, when I met Fagerolles--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are telling a lie,â\\x80\\x99 said she, interrupting him in a clear voice.\\nAnd to cut short his protestations--â\\x80\\x98Fagerolles was here,â\\x80\\x99 she added,\\nâ\\x80\\x98so you see that you are telling a lie.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, turning to Claude, â\\x80\\x98No, itâ\\x80\\x99s too disgusting. You canâ\\x80\\x99t conceive\\nwhat a liar he is. He tells lies like a woman, for the pleasure of it,\\nfor the merest trifle. Now, the whole of his story amounts simply to\\nthis: that he didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to spend three francs to buy me that book.\\nEach time he was to have sent me a bouquet, he had dropped it under the\\nwheels of a carriage, or there were no flowers to be had in all Paris.\\nAh! thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fellow who only cares for himself, and no mistake.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory, without getting in the least angry, tilted back his chair and\\nsucked his cigar, merely saying with a sneer:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! if you see Fagerolles now--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, what of it?â\\x80\\x99 she cried, becoming furious. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s no business of\\nyours. I snap my fingers at your Fagerolles, do you hear? He knows very\\nwell that people donâ\\x80\\x99t quarrel with me. We know each other; we sprouted\\nin the same crack between the paving-stones. Look here, whenever I like,\\nI have only to hold up my finger, and your Fagerolles will be there on\\nthe floor, licking my feet.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was growing animated, and Jory thought it prudent to beat a retreat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98_My_ Fagerolles,â\\x80\\x99 he muttered; â\\x80\\x98_my_ Fagerolles.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, _your_ Fagerolles. Do you think that I donâ\\x80\\x99t see through you both?\\nHe is always patting you on the back, as he hopes to get articles out of\\nyou, and you affect generosity and calculate the advantage youâ\\x80\\x99ll derive\\nif you write up an artist liked by the public.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis time Jory stuttered, feeling very much annoyed on account of Claude\\nbeing there. He did not attempt to defend himself, however, preferring\\nto turn the quarrel into a joke. Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t she amusing, eh? when she blazed\\nup like that, with her lustrous wicked eyes, and her twitching mouth,\\neager to indulge in vituperation?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But remember, my dear, this sort of thing cracks your Titianesque\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmake-up,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99 he added.\\n\\nShe began to laugh, mollified at once.\\n\\nClaude, basking in physical comfort, kept on sipping small glasses of\\ncognac one after another, without noticing it. During the two hours\\nthey had been there a kind of intoxication had stolen over them, the\\nhallucinatory intoxication produced by liqueurs and tobacco smoke. They\\nchanged the conversation; the high prices that pictures were\\nfetching came into question. Irma, who no longer spoke, kept a bit\\nof extinguished cigarette between her lips, and fixed her eyes on the\\npainter. At last she abruptly began to question him about his wife.\\n\\nHer questions did not appear to surprise him; his ideas were going\\nastray: â\\x80\\x98She had just come from the provinces,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98She was in a\\nsituation with a lady, and was a very good and honest girl.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pretty?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, yes, pretty.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor a moment Irma relapsed into her reverie, then she said, smiling:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dash it all! How lucky you are!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen she shook herself, and exclaimed, rising from the table: â\\x80\\x98Nearly\\nthree oâ\\x80\\x99clock! Ah! my children, I must turn you out of the house. Yes,\\nI have an appointment with an architect; I am going to see some ground\\nnear the Parc Monceau, you know, in the new quarter which is being\\nbuilt. I have scented a stroke of business in that direction.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey had returned to the drawing-room. She stopped before a\\nlooking-glass, annoyed at seeing herself so flushed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s about that house, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 asked Jory. â\\x80\\x98You have found the\\nmoney, then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe brought her hair down over her brow again, then with her hands\\nseemed to efface the flush on her cheeks; elongated the oval of her\\nface, and rearranged her tawny head, which had all the charm of a work\\nof art; and finally, turning round, she merely threw Jory these words by\\nway of reply: Look! thereâ\\x80\\x99s my Titianesque effect back again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was already, amidst their laughter, edging them towards the hall,\\nwhere once more, without speaking, she took Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s hands in her own,\\nher glance yet again diving into the depths of his eyes. When he\\nreached the street he felt uncomfortable. The cold air dissipated his\\nintoxication; he remorsefully reproached himself for having spoken of\\nChristine in that house, and swore to himself that he would never set\\nfoot there again.\\n\\nIndeed, a kind of shame deterred Claude from going home, and when his\\ncompanion, excited by the luncheon and feeling inclined to loaf about,\\nspoke of going to shake hands with Bongrand, he was delighted with the\\nidea, and both made their way to the Boulevard de Clichy.\\n\\nFor the last twenty years Bongrand had there occupied a very large\\nstudio, in which he had in no wise sacrificed to the tastes of the\\nday, to that magnificence of hangings and nick-nacks with which young\\npainters were then beginning to surround themselves. It was the bare,\\ngreyish studio of the old style, exclusively ornamented with sketches\\nby the master, which hung there unframed, and in close array like the\\nvotive offerings in a chapel. The only tokens of elegance consisted of\\na cheval glass, of the First Empire style, a large Norman wardrobe, and\\ntwo arm-chairs upholstered in Utrecht velvet, and threadbare with\\nusage. In one corner, too, a bearskin which had lost nearly all its\\nhair covered a large couch. However, the artist had retained since his\\nyouthful days, which had been spent in the camp of the Romanticists, the\\nhabit of wearing a special costume, and it was in flowing trousers, in\\na dressing-gown secured at the waist by a silken cord, and with his head\\ncovered with a priestâ\\x80\\x99s skull-cap, that he received his visitors.\\n\\nHe came to open the door himself, holding his palette and brushes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So here you are! It was a good idea of yours to come! I was thinking\\nabout you, my dear fellow. Yes, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know who it was that told me of\\nyour return, but I said to myself that it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be long before I saw\\nyou.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe hand that he had free grasped Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s in a burst of sincere\\naffection. He then shook Joryâ\\x80\\x99s, adding:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you, young pontiff; I read your last article, and thank you for\\nyour kind mention of myself. Come in, come in, both of you! You donâ\\x80\\x99t\\ndisturb me; Iâ\\x80\\x99m taking advantage of the daylight to the very last\\nminute, for thereâ\\x80\\x99s hardly time to do anything in this confounded month\\nof November.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had resumed his work, standing before his easel, on which there was\\na small canvas, which showed two women, mother and daughter, sitting\\nsewing in the embrasure of a sunlit window. The young fellows stood\\nlooking behind him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Exquisite,â\\x80\\x99 murmured Claude, at last.\\n\\nBongrand shrugged his shoulders without turning round.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pooh! A mere nothing at all. A fellow must occupy his time, eh? I did\\nthis from life at a friendâ\\x80\\x99s house, and I am cleaning it a bit.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But itâ\\x80\\x99s perfect--it is a little gem of truth and light,â\\x80\\x99 replied\\nClaude, warming up. â\\x80\\x98And do you know, what overcomes me is its\\nsimplicity, its very simplicity.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn hearing this the painter stepped back and blinked his eyes, looking\\nvery much surprised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You think so? It really pleases you? Well, when you came in I was just\\nthinking it was a foul bit of work. I give you my word, I was in the\\ndumps, and felt convinced that I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t a scrap of talent left.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis hands shook, his stalwart frame trembled as with the agony of\\ntravail. He rid himself of his palette, and came back towards them,\\nhis arms sawing the air, as it were; and this artist, who had grown old\\namidst success, who was assured of ranking in the French School, cried\\nto them:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It surprises you, eh? but there are days when I ask myself whether\\nI shall be able to draw a nose correctly. Yes, with every one of my\\npictures I still feel the emotion of a beginner; my heart beats, anguish\\nparches my mouth--in fact, I funk abominably. Ah! you youngsters, you\\nthink you know what funk means; but you havenâ\\x80\\x99t as much as a notion\\nof it, for if you fail with one work, you get quits by trying to do\\nsomething better. Nobody is down upon you; whereas we, the veterans,\\nwho have given our measure, who are obliged to keep up to the level\\npreviously attained, if not to surpass it, we mustnâ\\x80\\x99t weaken under\\npenalty of rolling down into the common grave. And so, Mr. Celebrity,\\nMr. Great Artist, wear out your brains, consume yourself in striving to\\nclimb higher, still higher, ever higher, and if you happen to kick\\nyour heels on the summit, think yourself lucky! Wear your heels out\\nin kicking them up as long as possible, and if you feel that you are\\ndeclining, why, make an end of yourself by rolling down amid the death\\nrattle of your talent, which is no longer suited to the period; roll\\ndown forgetful of such of your works as are destined to immortality, and\\nin despair at your powerless efforts to create still further!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis full voice had risen to a final outburst like thunder, and his\\nbroad flushed face wore an expression of anguish. He strode about,\\nand continued, as if carried away, in spite of himself, by a violent\\nwhirlwind:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have told you a score of times that one was for ever beginning oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncareer afresh, that joy did not consist in having reached the summit,\\nbut in the climbing, in the gaiety of scaling the heights. Only, you\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t understand, you cannot understand; a man must have passed through\\nit. Just remember! You hope for everything, you dream of everything; it\\nis the hour of boundless illusions, and your legs are so strong that the\\nmost fatiguing roads seem short; you are consumed with such an appetite\\nfor glory, that the first petty successes fill your mouth with a\\ndelicious taste. What a feast it will be when you are able to gratify\\nambition to satiety! You have nearly reached that point, and you look\\nright cheerfully on your scratches! Well, the thing is accomplished; the\\nsummit has been gained; it is now a question of remaining there. Then\\na life of abomination begins; you have exhausted intoxication, and you\\nhave discovered that it does not last long enough, that it is not worth\\nthe struggle it has cost, and that the dregs of the cup taste bitter.\\nThere is nothing left to be learnt, no new sensation to be felt; pride\\nhas had its allowance of fame; you know that you have produced your\\ngreatest works; and you are surprised that they did not bring keener\\nenjoyment with them. From that moment the horizon becomes void; no fresh\\nhope inflames you; there is nothing left but to die. And yet you still\\ncling on, you wonâ\\x80\\x99t admit that itâ\\x80\\x99s all up with you, you obstinately\\npersist in trying to produce--just as old men cling to love with\\npainful, ignoble efforts. Ah! a man ought to have the courage and the\\npride to strangle himself before his last masterpiece!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhile he spoke he seemed to have increased in stature, reaching to the\\nelevated ceiling of the studio, and shaken by such keen emotion that\\nthe tears started to his eyes. And he dropped into a chair before his\\npicture, asking with the anxious look of a beginner who has need of\\nencouragement:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then this really seems to you all right? I myself no longer dare to\\nbelieve anything. My unhappiness springs from the possession of both too\\nmuch and not enough critical acumen. The moment I begin a sketch I exalt\\nit, then, if itâ\\x80\\x99s not successful, I torture myself. It would be better\\nnot to know anything at all about it, like that brute Chambouvard, or\\nelse to see very clearly into the business and then give up painting....\\nReally now, you like this little canvas?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude and Jory remained motionless, astonished and embarrassed by those\\ntokens of the intense anguish of art in its travail. Had they come at a\\nmoment of crisis, that this master thus groaned with pain, and consulted\\nthem like comrades? The worst was that they had been unable to disguise\\nsome hesitation when they found themselves under the gaze of the ardent,\\ndilated eyes with which he implored them--eyes in which one could read\\nthe hidden fear of decline. They knew current rumours well enough; they\\nagreed with the opinion that since his â\\x80\\x98Village Weddingâ\\x80\\x99 the painter had\\nproduced nothing equal to that famous picture. Indeed, after maintaining\\nsomething of that standard of excellence in a few works, he was now\\ngliding into a more scientific, drier manner. Brightness of colour\\nwas vanishing; each work seemed to show a decline. However, these were\\nthings not to be said; so Claude, when he had recovered his composure,\\nexclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You never painted anything so powerful!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand looked at him again, straight in the eyes. Then he turned\\nto his work, in which he became absorbed, making a movement with his\\nherculean arms, as if he were breaking every bone of them to lift that\\nlittle canvas which was so very light. And he muttered to himself:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Confound it! how heavy it is! Never mind, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll die at it rather than\\nshow a falling-off.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe took up his palette and grew calm at the first stroke of the brush,\\nwhile bending his manly shoulders and broad neck, about which one\\nnoticed traces of peasant build remaining amid the bourgeois refinement\\ncontributed by the crossing of classes of which he was the outcome.\\n\\nSilence had ensued, but Jory, his eyes still fixed on the picture,\\nasked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is it sold?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand replied leisurely, like the artist who works when he likes\\nwithout care of profit:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No; I feel paralysed when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a dealer at my back.â\\x80\\x99 And, without\\npausing in his work, he went on talking, growing waggish.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! people are beginning to make a trade of painting now. Really and\\ntruly I have never seen such a thing before, old as I am getting. For\\ninstance, you, Mr. Amiable Journalist, what a quantity of flowers you\\nfling to the young ones in that article in which you mentioned me! There\\nwere two or three youngsters spoken of who were simply geniuses, nothing\\nless.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory burst out laughing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, when a fellow has a paper, he must make use of it. Besides, the\\npublic likes to have great men discovered for it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No doubt, public stupidity is boundless, and I am quite willing that\\nyou should trade on it. Only I remember the first starts that we old\\nfellows had. Dash it! We were not spoiled like that, I can tell you.\\nWe had ten yearsâ\\x80\\x99 labour and struggle before us ere we could impose\\non people a picture the size of your hand; whereas nowadays the first\\nhobbledehoy who can stick a figure on its legs makes all the trumpets of\\npublicity blare. And what kind of publicity is it? A hullabaloo from one\\nend of France to the other, sudden reputations that shoot up of a night,\\nand burst upon one like thunderbolts, amid the gaping of the throng.\\nAnd I say nothing of the works themselves, those works announced with\\nsalvoes of artillery, awaited amid a delirium of impatience, maddening\\nParis for a week, and then falling into everlasting oblivion!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98This is an indictment against journalism,â\\x80\\x99 said Jory, who had stretched\\nhimself on the couch and lighted another cigar. â\\x80\\x98There is a great deal\\nto be said for and against it, but devil a bit, a man must keep pace\\nwith the times.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand shook his head, and then started off again, amid a tremendous\\nburst of mirth:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No! no! one can no longer throw off the merest daub without being\\nhailed as a young â\\x80\\x9cmaster.â\\x80\\x9d Well, if you only knew how your young\\nmasters amuse me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut as if these words had led to some other ideas, he cooled down, and\\nturned towards Claude to ask this question: â\\x80\\x98By the way, have you seen\\nFagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 picture?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 said the young fellow, quietly.\\n\\nThey both remained looking at each other: a restless smile had risen to\\ntheir lips, and Bongrand eventually added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fellow who pillages you right and left.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory, becoming embarrassed, had lowered his eyes, asking himself whether\\nhe should defend Fagerolles. He, no doubt, concluded that it would be\\nprofitable to do so, for he began to praise the picture of the actress\\nin her dressing-room, an engraving of which was then attracting a great\\ndeal of notice in the print-shops. Was not the subject a really modern\\none? Was it not well painted, in the bright clear tone of the new\\nschool? A little more vigour might, perhaps, have been desirable;\\nbut every one ought to be left to his own temperament. And besides,\\nrefinement and charm were not so common by any means, nowadays.\\n\\nBending over his canvas, Bongrand, who, as a rule, had nothing but\\npaternal praise for the young ones, shook and made a visible effort\\nto avoid an outburst. The explosion took place, however, in spite of\\nhimself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just shut up, eh? about your Fagerolles! Do you think us greater fools\\nthan we really are? There! you see the great painter here present.\\nYes; I mean the young gentleman in front of you. Well, the whole trick\\nconsists in pilfering his originality, and dishing it up with the\\nwishy-washy sauce of the School of Arts! Quite so! you select a modern\\nsubject, and you paint in the clear bright style, only you adhere to\\ncorrectly commonplace drawing, to all the habitual pleasing style of\\ncomposition--in short, to the formula which is taught over yonder\\nfor the pleasure of the middle-classes. And you souse all that with\\ndeftness, that execrable deftness of the fingers which would just\\nas well carve cocoanuts, the flowing, pleasant deftness that begets\\nsuccess, and which ought to be punished with penal servitude, do you\\nhear?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe brandished his palette and brushes aloft, in his clenched fists.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are severe,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, feeling embarrassed. â\\x80\\x98Fagerolles shows\\ndelicacy in his work.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I have been told,â\\x80\\x99 muttered Jory, mildly, â\\x80\\x98that he has just signed a\\nvery profitable agreement with Naudet.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThat name, thrown haphazard into the conversation, had the effect of\\nonce more soothing Bongrand, who repeated, shrugging his shoulders:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! Naudet--ah! Naudet.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd he greatly amused the young fellows by telling them about Naudet,\\nwith whom he was well acquainted. He was a dealer, who, for some few\\nyears, had been revolutionising the picture trade. There was nothing of\\nthe old fashion about his style--the greasy coat and keen taste of\\nPapa Malgras, the watching for the pictures of beginners, bought at ten\\nfrancs, to be resold at fifteen, all the little humdrum comedy of\\nthe connoisseur, turning up his nose at a coveted canvas in order to\\ndepreciate it, worshipping painting in his inmost heart, and earning a\\nmeagre living by quickly and prudently turning over his petty capital.\\nNo, no; the famous Naudet had the appearance of a nobleman, with a\\nfancy-pattern jacket, a diamond pin in his scarf, and patent-leather\\nboots; he was well pomaded and brushed, and lived in fine style, with\\na livery-stable carriage by the month, a stall at the opera, and his\\nparticular table at Bignonâ\\x80\\x99s. And he showed himself wherever it was the\\ncorrect thing to be seen. For the rest, he was a speculator, a\\nStock Exchange gambler, not caring one single rap about art. But he\\nunfailingly scented success, he guessed what artist ought to be properly\\nstarted, not the one who seemed likely to develop the genius of a great\\npainter, furnishing food for discussion, but the one whose deceptive\\ntalent, set off by a pretended display of audacity, would command a\\npremium in the market. And that was the way in which he revolutionised\\nthat market, giving the amateur of taste the cold shoulder, and only\\ntreating with the moneyed amateur, who knew nothing about art, but who\\nbought a picture as he might buy a share at the Stock Exchange, either\\nfrom vanity or with the hope that it would rise in value.\\n\\nAt this stage of the conversation Bongrand, very jocular by nature,\\nand with a good deal of the mummer about him, began to enact the scene.\\nEnter Naudet in Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 studio.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve real genius, my dear fellow. Your last picture is sold, then?\\nFor how much?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cFor five hundred francs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cBut you must be mad; it was worth twelve hundred. And this one which\\nyou have by you--how much?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWell, my faith, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know. Suppose we say twelve hundred?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you talking about? Twelve hundred francs! You donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nunderstand me, then, my boy; itâ\\x80\\x99s worth two thousand. I take it at\\ntwo thousand. And from this day forward you must work for no one but\\nmyself--for me, Naudet. Good-bye, good-bye, my dear fellow; donâ\\x80\\x99t\\noverwork yourself--your fortune is made. I have taken it in hand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n Wherewith he goes off, taking the picture with him in his carriage. He\\ntrots it round among his amateurs, among whom he has spread the rumour\\nthat he has just discovered an extraordinary painter. One of the\\namateurs bites at last, and asks the price.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98Five thousand.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWhat, five thousand francs for the picture of a man whose name hasnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nthe least notoriety? Are you playing the fool with me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cLook here, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll make you a proposal; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll sell it you for five\\nthousand francs, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll sign an agreement to take it back in a\\ntwelvemonth at six thousand, if you no longer care for it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOf course the amateur is tempted. What does he risk after all? In\\nreality itâ\\x80\\x99s a good speculation, and so he buys. After that Naudet loses\\nno time, but disposes in a similar manner of nine or ten paintings by\\nthe same man during the course of the year. Vanity gets mingled with the\\nhope of gain, the prices go up, the pictures get regularly quoted, so\\nthat when Naudet returns to see his amateur, the latter, instead of\\nreturning the picture, buys another one for eight thousand francs. And\\nthe prices continue to go up, and painting degenerates into something\\nshady, a kind of gold mine situated on the heights of Montmartre,\\npromoted by a number of bankers, and around which there is a constant\\nbattle of bank-notes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was growing indignant, but Jory thought it all very clever, when\\nthere came a knock at the door. Bongrand, who went to open it, uttered a\\ncry of surprise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Naudet, as I live! We were just talking about you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNaudet, very correctly dressed, without a speck of mud on him, despite\\nthe horrible weather, bowed and came in with the reverential politeness\\nof a man of society entering a church.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very pleased--feel flattered, indeed, dear master. And you only spoke\\nwell of me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not at all, Naudet, not at all,â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand, in a quiet tone. â\\x80\\x98We\\nwere saying that your manner of trading was giving us a nice generation\\nof artists--tricksters crossed with dishonest business men.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNaudet smiled, without losing his composure.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The remark is harsh, but so charming! Never mind, never mind, dear\\nmaster, nothing that you say offends me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd, dropping into ecstasy before the picture of the two little women at\\nneedlework:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! Good heavens, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know this, itâ\\x80\\x99s a little marvel! Ah! that\\nlight, that broad substantial treatment! One has to go back to Rembrandt\\nfor anything like it; yes, to Rembrandt! Look here, I only came in to\\npay my respects, but I thank my lucky star for having brought me here.\\nLet us do a little bit of business. Let me have this gem. Anything you\\nlike to ask for it--Iâ\\x80\\x99ll cover it with gold.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOne could see Bongrandâ\\x80\\x99s back shake, as if his irritation were\\nincreasing at each sentence. He curtly interrupted the dealer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Too late; itâ\\x80\\x99s sold.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Sold, you say. And you cannot annul your bargain? Tell me, at any rate,\\nto whom itâ\\x80\\x99s sold? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do everything, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give anything. Ah! What a\\nhorrible blow! Sold, are you quite sure of it? Suppose you were offered\\ndouble the sum?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s sold, Naudet. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, the dealer went on lamenting. He remained for a few minutes\\nlonger, going into raptures before other sketches, while making the tour\\nof the studio with the keen glances of a speculator in search of luck.\\nWhen he realised that his time was badly chosen, and that he would be\\nable to take nothing away with him, he went off, bowing with an air of\\ngratitude, and repeating remarks of admiration as far as the landing.\\n\\nAs soon as he had gone, Jory, who had listened to the conversation with\\nsurprise, ventured to ask a question:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But you told us, I thought--It isnâ\\x80\\x99t sold, is it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWithout immediately answering, Bongrand went back to his picture. Then,\\nin his thundering voice, resuming in one cry all his hidden suffering,\\nthe whole of the nascent struggle within him which he dared not avow, he\\nsaid:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He plagues me. He shall never have anything of mine! Let him go and buy\\nof Fagerolles!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, Claude and Jory also said good-bye, leaving\\nBongrand struggling with his work in the waning daylight. Once outside,\\nwhen the young painter had left his companion, he did not at once return\\nhome to the Rue de Douai, in spite of his long absence. He still felt\\nthe want of walking about, of surrendering himself up to that great\\ncity of Paris, where the meetings of one single day sufficed to fill\\nhis brain; and this need of motion made him wander about till the black\\nnight had fallen, through the frozen mud of the streets, beneath the\\ngas-lamps, which, lighted up one by one, showed like nebulous stars\\namidst the fog.\\n\\nClaude impatiently awaited the Thursday when he was to dine at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s,\\nfor the latter, immutable in his habits, still invited his cronies to\\ndinner once a week. All those who chose could come, their covers were\\nlaid. His marriage, his change of life, the ardent literary struggle\\ninto which he had thrown himself, made no difference; he kept to his day\\nâ\\x80\\x98at home,â\\x80\\x99 that Thursday which dated from the time he had left college,\\nfrom the time they had all smoked their first pipes. As he himself\\nexpressed it, alluding to his wife, there was only one chum more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, old man,â\\x80\\x99 he had frankly said to Claude, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m greatly worried--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What about?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, about inviting Madame Christine. There are a lot of idiots, a lot\\nof philistines watching me, who would say all manner of things--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are quite right, old man. But Christine herself would decline to\\ncome. Oh! we understand the position very well. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come alone, depend\\nupon it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt six oâ\\x80\\x99clock, Claude started for Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s place in the Rue Nollet, in\\nthe depths of Batignolles, and he had no end of trouble in finding the\\nsmall pavilion which his friend had rented. First of all he entered a\\nlarge house facing the street, and applied to the doorkeeper, who made\\nhim cross three successive courtyards; then he went down a passage,\\nbetween two other buildings, descended some steps, and tumbled upon the\\niron gate of a small garden. That was the spot, the pavilion was there\\nat the end of a path. But it was so dark, and he had nearly broken his\\nlegs coming down the steps, that he dared not venture any further, the\\nmore so as a huge dog was barking furiously. At last he heard the voice\\nof Sandoz, who was coming forward and trying to quiet the dog.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, itâ\\x80\\x99s you! We are quite in the country, arenâ\\x80\\x99t we? We are going to\\nset up a lantern, so that our company may not break their necks. Come\\nin, come in! Will you hold your noise, you brute of a Bertrand? Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou see that itâ\\x80\\x99s a friend, fool?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon the dog accompanied them as far as the pavilion, wagging his\\ntail and barking joyously. A young servant-girl had come out with\\na lantern, which she fastened to the gate, in order to light up the\\nbreakneck steps. In the garden there was simply a small central lawn,\\non which there stood a large plum tree, diffusing a shade around that\\nrotted the grass; and just in front of the low house, which showed only\\nthree windows, there stretched an arbour of Virginia creeper, with a\\nbrand-new seat shining there as an ornament amid the winter showers,\\npending the advent of the summer sun.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come in,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Sandoz.\\n\\nOn the right-hand side of the hall he ushered Claude into the parlour,\\nwhich he had turned into a study. The dining-room and kitchen were\\non the left. Upstairs, his mother, who was now altogether bedridden,\\noccupied the larger room, while he and his wife contented themselves\\nwith the other one, and a dressing-room that parted the two. That was\\nthe whole place, a real cardboard box, with rooms like little drawers\\nseparated by partitions as thin as paper. Withal, it was the abode of\\nwork and hope, vast in comparison with the ordinary garrets of youth,\\nand already made bright by a beginning of comfort and luxury.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s room here, eh?â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98Ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s a jolly sight more\\ncomfortable than the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Enfer. You see that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a room to myself.\\nAnd I have bought myself an oaken writing-table, and my wife made me\\na present of that dwarf palm in that pot of old Rouen ware. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it\\nswell, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis wife came in at that very moment. Tall, with a pleasant, tranquil\\nface and beautiful brown hair, she wore a large white apron over her\\nplainly made dress of black poplin; for although they had a regular\\nservant, she saw to the cooking, for she was proud of certain of\\nher dishes, and she put the household on a footing of middle-class\\ncleanliness and love of cheer.\\n\\nShe and Claude became old chums at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Call him Claude, my darling. And you, old man, call her Henriette. No\\nmadame nor monsieur, or I shall fine you five sous each time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey laughed, and she scampered away, being wanted in the kitchen to\\nlook after a southern dish, a _bouillabaisse_, with which she wished\\nto surprise the Plassans friend. She had obtained the recipe from her\\nhusband himself, and had become marvellously deft at it, so he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your wife is charming,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, â\\x80\\x98and I see she spoils you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Sandoz, seated at his table, with his elbows among such pages of the\\nbook he was working at as he had written that morning, began to talk of\\nthe first novel of his series, which he had published in October. Ah!\\nthey had treated his poor book nicely! It had been a throttling,\\na butchering, all the critics yelling at his heels, a broadside of\\nimprecations, as if he had murdered people in a wood. He himself laughed\\nat it, excited rather than otherwise, for he had sturdy shoulders and\\nthe quiet bearing of a toiler who knows what heâ\\x80\\x99s after. Mere surprise\\nremained to him at the profound lack of intelligence shown by those\\nfellows the critics, whose articles, knocked off on the corner of some\\ntable, bespattered him with mud, without appearing as much as to guess\\nat the least of his intentions. Everything was flung into the same\\nslop-pail of abuse: his studies of physiological man; the important part\\nhe assigned to circumstances and surroundings; his allusions to nature,\\never and ever creating; in short, life--entire, universal life--existent\\nthrough all the animal world without there really being either high\\nor low, beauty or ugliness; he was insulted, too, for his boldness of\\nlanguage for the conviction he expressed that all things ought to be\\nsaid, that there are abominable expressions which become necessary,\\nlike branding irons, and that a language emerges enriched from such\\nstrength-giving baths. He easily granted their anger, but he would at\\nleast have liked them to do him the honour of understanding him and\\ngetting angry at his audacity, not at the idiotic, filthy designs of\\nwhich he was accused.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Really,â\\x80\\x99 he continued, â\\x80\\x98I believe that the world still contains more\\nidiots than downright spiteful people. They are enraged with me on\\naccount of the form I give to my productions, the written sentences, the\\nsimiles, the very life of my style. Yes, the middle-classes fairly split\\nwith hatred of literature!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen he became silent, having grown sad.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Never mind,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, after an interval, â\\x80\\x98you are happy, you at\\nleast work, you produce--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz had risen from his seat with a gesture of sudden pain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98True, I work. I work out my books to their last pages--But if you only\\nknew, if I told you amidst what discouragement, amidst what torture!\\nWonâ\\x80\\x99t those idiots take it into their heads to accuse me of pride! I,\\nwhom the imperfection of my work pursues even in my sleep--I, who\\nnever look over the pages of the day before, lest I should find them so\\nexecrable that I might afterwards lack the courage to continue. Oh, I\\nwork, no doubt, I work! I go on working, as I go on living, because I\\nam born to it, but I am none the gayer on account of it. I am never\\nsatisfied; there is always a great collapse at the end.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a loud exclamation outside, and Jory appeared,\\ndelighted with life, and relating that he had just touched up an old\\narticle in order to have the evening to himself. Almost immediately\\nafterwards Gagniere and Mahoudeau, who had met at the door, came in\\nconversing together. The former, who had been absorbed for some months\\nin a theory of colours, was explaining his system to the other.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I paint my shade in,â\\x80\\x99 he continued, as if in a dream. â\\x80\\x98The red of the\\nflag loses its brightness and becomes yellowish because it stands\\nout against the blue of the sky, the complementary shade of\\nwhich--orange--blends with red--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, interested at once, was already questioning him when the servant\\nbrought in a telegram.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s from Dubuche, who apologises; he\\npromises to come and surprise us at about eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this moment Henriette threw the door wide open, and personally\\nannounced that dinner was ready. She had doffed her white apron, and\\ncordially shook hands, as hostess, with all of them. â\\x80\\x98Take your seats!\\ntake your seats!â\\x80\\x99 was her cry. It was half-past seven already, the\\n_bouillabaisse_ could not wait. Jory, having observed that Fagerolles\\nhad sworn to him that he would come, they would not believe it.\\nFagerolles was getting ridiculous with his habit of aping the great\\nartist overwhelmed with work!\\n\\nThe dining-room into which they passed was so small that, in order to\\nmake room for a piano, a kind of alcove had been made out of a dark\\ncloset which had formerly served for the accommodation of crockery.\\nHowever, on grand occasions half a score of people still gathered round\\nthe table, under the white porcelain hanging lamp, but this was only\\naccomplished by blocking up the sideboard, so that the servant could not\\neven pass to take a plate from it. However, it was the mistress of the\\nhouse who carved, while the master took his place facing her, against\\nthe blockaded sideboard, in order to hand round whatever things might be\\nrequired.\\n\\nHenriette had placed Claude on her right hand, Mahoudeau on her left,\\nwhile Gagniere and Jory were seated next to Sandoz.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Francoise,â\\x80\\x99 she called, â\\x80\\x98give me the slices of toast. They are on the\\nrange.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd the girl having brought the toast, she distributed two slices to\\neach of them, and was beginning to ladle the _bouillabaisse_ into the\\nplates, when the door opened once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Fagerolles at last!â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98I have given your seat to Mahoudeau.\\nSit down there, next to Claude.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe apologised with an air of courtly politeness, by alleging a business\\nappointment. Very elegantly dressed, tightly buttoned up in clothes of\\nan English cut, he had the carriage of a man about town, relieved by\\nthe retention of a touch of artistic free-and-easiness. Immediately on\\nsitting down he grasped his neighbourâ\\x80\\x99s hand, affecting great delight.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, my old Claude! I have for such a long time wanted to see you. A\\nscore of times I intended going after you into the country; but then,\\nyou know, circumstances--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, feeling uncomfortable at these protestations, endeavoured to\\nmeet them with a like cordiality. But Henriette, who was still serving,\\nsaved the situation by growing impatient.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, Fagerolles, just answer me. Do you wish two slices of toast?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Certainly, madame, two, if you please. I am very fond of\\n_bouillabaisse_. Besides, yours is delicious, a marvel!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, they all went into raptures over it, especially Jory and\\nMahoudeau, who declared they had never tasted anything better at\\nMarseilles; so much so, that the young wife, delighted and still flushed\\nwith the heat of the kitchen, her ladle in her hand, had all she could\\ndo to refill the plates held out to her; and, indeed, she rose up and\\nran in person to the kitchen to fetch the remains of the soup, for the\\nservant-girl was losing her wits.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, eat something,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz to her. â\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ll wait well enough till\\nyou have done.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut she was obstinate and remained standing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Never mind me. You had better pass the bread--yes, there, behind you on\\nthe sideboard. Jory prefers crumb, which he can soak in the soup.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz rose in his turn and assisted his wife, while the others chaffed\\nJory on his love for sops. And Claude, moved by the pleasant cordiality\\nof his hosts, and awaking, as it were, from a long sleep, looked at them\\nall, asking himself whether he had only left them on the previous night,\\nor whether four years had really elapsed since he had dined with them\\none Thursday. They were different, however; he felt them to be changed:\\nMahoudeau soured by misery, Jory wrapt up in his own pleasures, Gagniere\\nmore distant, with his thoughts elsewhere. And it especially seemed to\\nhim that Fagerolles was chilly, in spite of his exaggerated cordiality\\nof manner. No doubt their features had aged somewhat amid the wear and\\ntear of life; but it was not only that which he noticed, it seemed to\\nhim also as if there was a void between them; he beheld them isolated\\nand estranged from each other, although they were seated elbow to elbow\\nin close array round the table. Then the surroundings were different;\\nnowadays, a woman brought her charm to bear on them, and calmed them by\\nher presence. Then why did he, face to face with the irrevocable current\\nof things, which die and are renewed, experience that sensation of\\nbeginning something over again--why was it that he could have sworn that\\nhe had been seated at that same place only last Thursday? At last he\\nthought he understood. It was Sandoz who had not changed, who remained\\nas obstinate as regards his habits of friendship, as regards his habits\\nof work, as radiant at being able to receive his friends at the board of\\nhis new home as he had formerly been, when sharing his frugal bachelor\\nfare with them. A dream of eternal friendship made him changeless.\\nThursdays similar one to another followed and followed on until the\\nfurthest stages of their lives. All of them were eternally together, all\\nstarted at the self-same hour, and participated in the same triumph!\\n\\nSandoz must have guessed the thought that kept Claude mute, for he said\\nto him across the table, with his frank, youthful smile:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, old man, here you are again! Ah, confound it! we missed you\\nsorely. But, you see, nothing is changed; we are all the same--arenâ\\x80\\x99t\\nwe, all of you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey answered by nodding their heads--no doubt, no doubt!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98With this difference,â\\x80\\x99 he went on, beaming--â\\x80\\x98with this difference, that\\nthe cookery is somewhat better than in the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Enfer! What a lot of\\nmesses I did make you swallow!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAfter the _bouillabaisse_ there came a _civet_ of hare; and a roast fowl\\nand salad terminated the dinner. But they sat for a long time at table,\\nand the dessert proved a protracted affair, although the conversation\\nlacked the fever and violence of yore. Every one spoke of himself and\\nended by relapsing into silence on perceiving that the others did not\\nlisten to him. With the cheese, however, when they had tasted some\\nburgundy, a sharp little growth, of which the young couple had ordered a\\ncask out of the profits of Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s first novel, their voices rose to a\\nhigher key, and they all grew animated.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So you have made an arrangement with Naudet, eh?â\\x80\\x99 asked Mahoudeau,\\nwhose bony cheeks seemed to have grown yet more hollow. â\\x80\\x98Is it true that\\nhe guarantees you fifty thousand francs for the first year?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles replied, with affected carelessness, â\\x80\\x98Yes, fifty thousand\\nfrancs. But nothing is settled; Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking it over. It is hard to\\nengage oneself like that. I am not going to do anything precipitately.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The deuce!â\\x80\\x99 muttered the sculptor; â\\x80\\x98you are hard to please. For twenty\\nfrancs a day Iâ\\x80\\x99d sign whatever you like.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all now listened to Fagerolles, who posed as being wearied by\\nhis budding success. He still had the same good-looking, disturbing\\nhussy-like face, but the fashion in which he wore his hair and the cut\\nof his beard lent him an appearance of gravity. Although he still came\\nat long intervals to Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s, he was separating from the band; he\\nshowed himself on the boulevards, frequented the cafes and newspaper\\noffices--all the places where a man can advertise himself and make\\nuseful acquaintances. These were tactics of his own, a determination to\\ncarve his own victory apart from the others; the smart idea that if he\\nwished to triumph he ought to have nothing more in common with those\\nrevolutionists, neither dealer, nor connections, nor habits. It was\\neven said that he had interested the female element of two or three\\ndrawing-rooms in his success, not in Joryâ\\x80\\x99s style, but like a vicious\\nfellow who rises superior to his passions, and is content to adulate\\nsuperannuated baronesses.\\n\\nJust then Jory, in view of lending importance to himself, called\\nFagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 attention to a recently published article; he pretended that\\nhe had made Fagerolles just as he pretended that he had made Claude.\\nâ\\x80\\x98I say, have you read that article of Vernierâ\\x80\\x99s about yourself? Thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nanother fellow who repeats my ideas!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, he does get articles, and no mistake!â\\x80\\x99 sighed Mahoudeau.\\n\\nFagerolles made a careless gesture, but he smiled with secret contempt\\nfor all those poor beggars who were so utterly deficient in shrewdness\\nthat they clung, like simpletons, to their crude style, when it was so\\neasy to conquer the crowd. Had it not sufficed for him to break with\\nthem, after pillaging them, to make his own fortune? He benefited by\\nall the hatred that folks had against them; his pictures, of a softened,\\nattenuated style, were held up in praise, so as to deal the death-blow\\nto their ever obstinately violent works.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Have you read Vernierâ\\x80\\x99s article?â\\x80\\x99 asked Jory of Gagniere. â\\x80\\x98Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t he\\nsay exactly what I said?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor the last few moments Gagniere had been absorbed in contemplating\\nhis glass, the wine in which cast a ruddy reflection on the white\\ntablecloth. He started:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh, what, Vernierâ\\x80\\x99s article?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, yes; in fact, all those articles which appear about Fagerolles.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere in amazement turned to the painter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, are they writing articles about you? I know nothing about them, I\\nhavenâ\\x80\\x99t seen them. Ah! they are writing articles about you, but whatever\\nfor?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a mad roar of laughter. Fagerolles alone grinned with an\\nill grace, for he fancied himself the butt of some spiteful joke. But\\nGagniere spoke in absolute good faith. He felt surprised at the success\\nof a painter who did not even observe the laws regulating the value of\\ntints. Success for that trickster! Never! For in that case what would\\nbecome of conscientiousness?\\n\\nThis boisterous hilarity enlivened the end of the dinner. They all left\\noff eating, though the mistress of the house still insisted upon filling\\ntheir plates.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My dear, do attend to them,â\\x80\\x99 she kept saying to Sandoz, who had\\ngrown greatly excited amidst the din. â\\x80\\x98Just stretch out your hand; the\\nbiscuits are on the side-board.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all declined anything more, and rose up. As the rest of the evening\\nwas to be spent there, round the table, drinking tea, they leaned back\\nagainst the walls and continued chatting while the servant cleared\\naway. The young couple assisted, Henriette putting the salt-cellars in a\\ndrawer, and Sandoz helping to fold the cloth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You can smoke,â\\x80\\x99 said Henriette. â\\x80\\x98You know that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t inconvenience\\nme in the least.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles, who had drawn Claude into the window recess, offered him a\\ncigar, which was declined.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98True, I forgot; you donâ\\x80\\x99t smoke. Ah! I say, I must go to see what you\\nhave brought back with you. Some very interesting things, no doubt. You\\nknow what I think of your talent. You are the cleverest of us all.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe showed himself very humble, sincere at heart, and allowing his\\nadmiration of former days to rise once more to the surface; indeed,\\nhe for ever bore the imprint of anotherâ\\x80\\x99s genius, which he admitted,\\ndespite the complex calculations of his cunning mind. But his humility\\nwas mingled with a certain embarrassment very rare with him--the\\nconcern he felt at the silence which the master of his youth preserved\\nrespecting his last picture. At last he ventured to ask, with quivering\\nlips:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Did you see my actress at the Salon? Do you like it? Tell me candidly.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude hesitated for a moment; then, like the good-natured fellow he\\nwas, said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes; there are some very good bits in it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles already repented having asked that stupid question, and he\\nended by altogether floundering; he tried to excuse himself for his\\nplagiarisms and his compromises. When with great difficulty he had\\ngot out of the mess, enraged with himself for his clumsiness, he for a\\nmoment became the joker of yore again, made even Claude laugh till he\\ncried, and amused them all. At last he held out his hand to take leave\\nof Henriette.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, going so soon?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Alas! yes, dear madame. This evening my father is entertaining the head\\nof a department at one of the ministries, an official whom heâ\\x80\\x99s trying\\nto influence in view of obtaining a decoration; and, as I am one of his\\ntitles to that distinction, I had to promise that I would look in.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhen he was gone, Henriette, who had exchanged a few words in a low\\nvoice with Sandoz, disappeared; and her light footfall was heard on the\\nfirst floor. Since her marriage it was she who tended the old, infirm\\nmother, absenting herself in this fashion several times during the\\nevening, just as the son had done formerly.\\n\\nNot one of the guests, however, had noticed her leave the room.\\nMahoudeau and Gagniere were now talking about Fagerolles; showing\\nthemselves covertly bitter, without openly attacking him. As yet\\nthey contented themselves with ironical glances and shrugs of the\\nshoulders--all the silent contempt of fellows who donâ\\x80\\x99t wish to slash a\\nchum. Then they fell back on Claude; they prostrated themselves before\\nhim, overwhelmed him with the hopes they set in him. Ah! it was high\\ntime for him to come back, for he alone, with his great gifts, his\\nvigorous touch, could become the master, the recognised chief. Since\\nthe Salon of the Rejected the â\\x80\\x98school of the open airâ\\x80\\x99 had increased in\\nnumbers; a growing influence was making itself felt; but unfortunately,\\nthe efforts were frittered away; the new recruits contented themselves\\nwith producing sketches, impressions thrown off with a few strokes of\\nthe brush; they were awaiting the necessary man of genius, the one who\\nwould incarnate the new formula in masterpieces. What a position to\\ntake! to master the multitude, to open up a century, to create a new\\nart! Claude listened to them, with his eyes turned to the floor and his\\nface very pale. Yes, that indeed was his unavowed dream, the ambition he\\ndared not confess to himself. Only, with the delight that the flattery\\ncaused him, there was mingled a strange anguish, a dread of the future,\\nas he heard them raising him to the position of dictator, as if he had\\nalready triumphed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed at last; â\\x80\\x98there are others as good as myself. I am\\nstill seeking my real line.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory, who felt annoyed, was smoking in silence. Suddenly, as the others\\nobstinately kept at it, he could not refrain from remarking:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All this, my boys, is because you are vexed at Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 success.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey energetically denied it; they burst out in protestations.\\nFagerolles, the young master! What a good joke!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, you are turning your back upon us, we know it,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no fear of your writing a line about us nowadays.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, my dear fellow,â\\x80\\x99 answered Jory, vexed, â\\x80\\x98everything I write about\\nyou is cut out. You make yourselves hated everywhere. Ah! if I had a\\npaper of my own!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHenriette came back, and Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s eyes having sought hers, she answered\\nhim with a glance and the same affectionate, quiet smile that he had\\nshown when leaving his motherâ\\x80\\x99s room in former times. Then she summoned\\nthem all. They sat down again round the table while she made the tea and\\npoured it out. But the gathering grew sad, benumbed, as it were, with\\nlassitude. Sandoz vainly tried a diversion by admitting Bertrand, the\\nbig dog, who grovelled at sight of the sugar-basin, and ended by\\ngoing to sleep near the stove, where he snored like a man. Since the\\ndiscussion on Fagerolles there had been intervals of silence, a kind of\\nbored irritation, which fell heavily upon them amidst the dense tobacco\\nsmoke. And, in fact, Gagniere felt so out of sorts that he left the\\ntable for a moment to seat himself at the piano, murdering some passages\\nfrom Wagner in a subdued key, with the stiff fingers of an amateur who\\ntries his first scale at thirty.\\n\\nTowards eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock Dubuche, arriving at last, contributed the\\nfinishing touch to the general frost. He had made his escape from a ball\\nto fulfil what he considered a remaining duty towards his old comrades;\\nand his dress-coat, his white necktie, his fat, pale face, all\\nproclaimed his vexation at having come, the importance he attached to\\nthe sacrifice, and the fear he felt of compromising his new position. He\\navoided mentioning his wife, so that he might not have to bring her to\\nSandozâ\\x80\\x99s. When he had shaken hands with Claude, without showing more\\nemotion than if he had met him the day before, he declined a cup of\\ntea and spoke slowly--puffing out his cheeks the while--of his worry in\\nsettling in a brand-new house, and of the work that had overwhelmed\\nhim since he had attended to the business of his father-in-law, who was\\nbuilding a whole street near the Parc Monceau.\\n\\nThen Claude distinctly felt that something had snapped. Had life then\\nalready carried away the evenings of former days, those evenings so\\nfraternal in their very violence, when nothing had as yet separated\\nthem, when not one of them had thought of keeping his part of glory to\\nhimself? Nowadays the battle was beginning. Each hungry one was eagerly\\nbiting. And a fissure was there, a scarcely perceptible crack that had\\nrent the old, sworn friendships, and some day would make them crumble\\ninto a thousand pieces.\\n\\nHowever, Sandoz, with his craving for perpetuity, had so far noticed\\nnothing; he still beheld them as they had been in the Rue dâ\\x80\\x99Enfer, all\\narm in arm, starting off to victory. Why change what was well? Did not\\nhappiness consist in one pleasure selected from among all, and then\\nenjoyed for ever afterwards? And when, an hour later, the others made up\\ntheir minds to go off, wearied by the dull egotism of Dubuche, who\\nhad not left off talking about his own affairs; when they had dragged\\nGagniere, in a trance, away from the piano, Sandoz, followed by his\\nwife, absolutely insisted, despite the coldness of the night, on\\naccompanying them all to the gate at the end of the garden. He shook\\nhands all round, and shouted after them:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Till Thursday, Claude; till next Thursday, all of you, eh? Mind you all\\ncome!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Till Thursday!â\\x80\\x99 repeated Henriette, who had taken the lantern and was\\nholding it aloft so as to light the steps.\\n\\nAnd, amid the laughter, Gagniere and Mahoudeau replied, jokingly: â\\x80\\x98Till\\nThursday, young master! Good-night, young master!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOnce in the Rue Nollet, Dubuche immediately hailed a cab, in which\\nhe drove away. The other four walked together as far as the outer\\nboulevards, scarcely exchanging a word, looking dazed, as it were, at\\nhaving been in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s company so long. At last Jory decamped,\\npretending that some proofs were waiting for him at the office of his\\nnewspaper. Then Gagniere mechanically stopped Claude in front of the\\nCafe Baudequin, the gas of which was still blazing away. Mahoudeau\\nrefused to go in, and went off alone, sadly ruminating, towards the Rue\\ndu Cherche-Midi.\\n\\nWithout knowing how, Claude found himself seated at their old table,\\nopposite Gagniere, who was silent. The cafe had not changed. The friends\\nstill met there of a Sunday, showing a deal of fervour, in fact, since\\nSandoz had lived in the neighbourhood; but the band was now lost amid\\na flood of new-comers; it was slowly being submerged by the increasing\\ntriteness of the young disciples of the â\\x80\\x98open air.â\\x80\\x99 At that hour\\nof night, however, the establishment was getting empty. Three young\\npainters, whom Claude did not know, came to shake hands with him as they\\nwent off; and then there merely remained a petty retired tradesman of\\nthe neighbourhood, asleep in front of a saucer.\\n\\nGagniere, quite at his ease, as if he had been at home, absolutely\\nindifferent to the yawns of the solitary waiter, who was stretching his\\narms, glanced towards Claude, but without seeing him, for his eyes were\\ndim.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98By the way,â\\x80\\x99 said the latter, â\\x80\\x98what were you explaining to Mahoudeau\\nthis evening? Yes, about the red of a flag turning yellowish amid\\nthe blue of the sky. That was it, eh? You are studying the theory of\\ncomplementary colours.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut the other did not answer. He took up his glass of beer, set it down\\nagain without tasting its contents, and with an ecstatic smile ended by\\nmuttering:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Haydn has all the gracefulness of a rhetorician--his is a gentle\\nmusic, quivering like the voice of a great-grandmother in powdered hair.\\nMozart, heâ\\x80\\x99s the precursory genius--the first who endowed an orchestra\\nwith an individual voice; and those two will live mostly because they\\ncreated Beethoven. Ah, Beethoven! power and strength amidst serene\\nsuffering, Michael Angelo at the tomb of the Medici! A heroic logician,\\na kneader of human brains; for the symphony, with choral accompaniments,\\nwas the starting-point of all the great ones of to-day!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe waiter, tired of waiting, began to turn off the gas, wearily\\ndragging his feet along as he did so. Mournfulness pervaded the deserted\\nroom, dirty with saliva and cigar ends, and reeking of spilt drink;\\nwhile from the hushed boulevard the only sound that came was the distant\\nblubbering of some drunkard.\\n\\nGagniere, still in the clouds, however, continued to ride his\\nhobby-horse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Weber passes by us amid a romantic landscape, conducting the ballads of\\nthe dead amidst weeping willows and oaks with twisted branches. Schumann\\nfollows him, beneath the pale moonlight, along the shores of silvery\\nlakes. And behold, here comes Rossini, incarnation of the musical gift,\\nso gay, so natural, without the least concern for expression, caring\\nnothing for the public, and who isnâ\\x80\\x99t my man by a long way--ah!\\ncertainly not--but then, all the same, he astonishes one by his wealth\\nof production, and the huge effects he derives from an accumulation of\\nvoices and an ever-swelling repetition of the same strain. These\\nthree led to Meyerbeer, a cunning fellow who profited by everything,\\nintroducing symphony into opera after Weber, and giving dramatic\\nexpression to the unconscious formulas of Rossini. Oh! the superb bursts\\nof sound, the feudal pomp, the martial mysticism, the quivering of\\nfantastic legends, the cry of passion ringing out through history! And\\nsuch finds!--each instrument endowed with a personality, the dramatic\\n_recitatives_ accompanied symphoniously by the orchestra--the typical\\nmusical phrase on which an entire work is built! Ah! he was a great\\nfellow--a very great fellow indeed!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am going to shut up, sir,â\\x80\\x99 said the waiter, drawing near.\\n\\nAnd, seeing that Gagniere did not as much as look round, he went to\\nawaken the petty retired tradesman, who was still dozing in front of his\\nsaucer.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am going to shut up, sir.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe belated customer rose up, shivering, fumbled in the dark corner\\nwhere he was seated for his walking-stick, and when the waiter had\\npicked it up for him from under the seats he went away.\\n\\nAnd Gagniere rambled on:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Berlioz has mingled literature with his work. He is the musical\\nillustrator of Shakespeare, Virgil, and Goethe. But what a painter!--the\\nDelacroix of music, who makes sound blaze forth amidst effulgent\\ncontrasts of colour. And withal he has romanticism in his brain, a\\nreligious mysticism that carries him away, an ecstasy that soars higher\\nthan mountain summits. A bad builder of operas, but marvellous in\\ndetached pieces, asking too much at times of the orchestra which he\\ntortures, having pushed the personality of instruments to its furthest\\nlimits; for each instrument represents a character to him. Ah! that\\nremark of his about clarionets: â\\x80\\x9cThey typify beloved women.â\\x80\\x9d Ah! it has\\nalways made a shiver run down my back. And Chopin, so dandified in\\nhis Byronism; the dreamy poet of those who suffer from neurosis! And\\nMendelssohn, that faultless chiseller! a Shakespeare in dancing pumps,\\nwhose â\\x80\\x9csongs without wordsâ\\x80\\x9d are gems for women of intellect! And after\\nthat--after that--a man should go down on his knees.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was now only one gas-lamp alight just above his head, and the\\nwaiter standing behind him stood waiting amid the gloomy, chilly void of\\nthe room. Gagniereâ\\x80\\x99s voice had come to a reverential _tremolo_. He was\\nreaching devotional fervour as he approached the inner tabernacle, the\\nholy of holies.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! Schumann, typical of despair, the voluptuousness of despair! Yes,\\nthe end of everything, the last song of saddened purity hovering above\\nthe ruins of the world! Oh! Wagner, the god in whom centuries of music\\nare incarnated! His work is the immense ark, all the arts blended\\nin one; the real humanity of the personages at last expressed, the\\norchestra itself living apart the life of the drama. And what a massacre\\nof conventionality, of inept formulas! what a revolutionary emancipation\\namid the infinite! The overture of â\\x80\\x9cTannhauser,â\\x80\\x9d ah! thatâ\\x80\\x99s the sublime\\nhallelujah of the new era. First of all comes the chant of the pilgrims,\\nthe religious strain, calm, deep and slowly throbbing; then the voices\\nof the sirens gradually drown it; the voluptuous pleasures of Venus,\\nfull of enervating delight and languor, grow more and more imperious and\\ndisorderly; and soon the sacred air gradually returns, like the aspiring\\nvoice of space, and seizes hold of all other strains and blends them\\nin one supreme harmony, to waft them away on the wings of a triumphal\\nhymn!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am going to shut up, sir,â\\x80\\x99 repeated the waiter.\\n\\nClaude, who no longer listened, he also being absorbed in his own\\npassion, emptied his glass of beer and cried: â\\x80\\x98Eh, old man, they are\\ngoing to shut up.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Gagniere trembled. A painful twitch came over his ecstatic face,\\nand he shivered as if he had dropped from the stars. He gulped down his\\nbeer, and once on the pavement outside, after pressing his companionâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhand in silence, he walked off into the gloom.\\n\\nIt was nearly two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning when Claude returned to the Rue\\nde Douai. During the week that he had been scouring Paris anew, he had\\neach time brought back with him the feverish excitement of the day. But\\nhe had never before returned so late, with his brain so hot and smoky.\\nChristine, overcome with fatigue, was asleep under the lamp, which had\\ngone out, her brow resting on the edge of the table.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nAT last Christine gave a final stroke with her feather-broom, and they\\nwere settled. The studio in the Rue de Douai, small and inconvenient,\\nhad only one little room, and a kitchen, as big as a cupboard, attached\\nto it. They were obliged to take their meals in the studio; they had\\nto live in it, with the child always tumbling about their legs. And\\nChristine had a deal of trouble in making their few sticks suffice, as\\nshe wished to do, in order to save expense. After all, she was obliged\\nto buy a second-hand bedstead; and yielded to the temptation of having\\nsome white muslin curtains, which cost her seven sous the metre. The\\nden then seemed charming to her, and she began to keep it scrupulously\\nclean, resolving to do everything herself, and to dispense with a\\nservant, as living would be a difficult matter.\\n\\nDuring the first months Claude lived in ever-increasing excitement. His\\nperegrinations through the noisy streets; his feverish discussions on\\nthe occasion of his visits to friends; all the rage and all the burning\\nideas he thus brought home from out of doors, made him hold forth aloud\\neven in his sleep. Paris had seized hold of him again; and in the full\\nblaze of that furnace, a second youth, enthusiastic ambition to see,\\ndo, and conquer, had come upon him. Never had he felt such a passion for\\nwork, such hope, as if it sufficed for him to stretch out his hand in\\norder to create masterpieces that should set him in the right rank,\\nwhich was the first. While crossing Paris he discovered subjects for\\npictures everywhere; the whole city, with its streets, squares, bridges,\\nand panoramas of life, suggested immense frescoes, which he, however,\\nalways found too small, for he was intoxicated with the thought of doing\\nsomething colossal. Thus he returned home quivering, his brain seething\\nwith projects; and of an evening threw off sketches on bits of paper, in\\nthe lamp-light, without being able to decide by what he ought to begin\\nthe series of grand productions that he dreamt about.\\n\\nOne serious obstacle was the smallness of his studio. If he had only had\\nthe old garret of the Quai de Bourbon, or even the huge dining-room of\\nBennecourt! But what could he do in that oblong strip of space, that\\nkind of passage, which the landlord of the house impudently let to\\npainters for four hundred francs a year, after roofing it in with glass?\\nThe worst was that the sloping glazed roof looked to the north, between\\ntwo high walls, and only admitted a greenish cellar-like light. He was\\ntherefore obliged to postpone his ambitious projects, and he decided\\nto begin with average-sized canvases, wisely saying to himself that the\\ndimensions of a picture are not a proper test of an artistâ\\x80\\x99s genius.\\n\\nThe moment seemed to him favourable for the success of a courageous\\nartist who, amidst the breaking up of the old schools, would at length\\nbring some originality and sincerity into his work. The formulas of\\nrecent times were already shaken. Delacroix had died without leaving any\\ndisciples. Courbet had barely a few clumsy imitators behind him; their\\nbest pieces would merely become so many museum pictures, blackened\\nby age, tokens only of the art of a certain period. It seemed easy to\\nforesee the new formula that would spring from theirs, that rush of\\nsunshine, that limpid dawn which was rising in new works under the\\nnascent influence of the â\\x80\\x98open airâ\\x80\\x99 school. It was undeniable; those\\nlight-toned paintings over which people had laughed so much at the Salon\\nof the Rejected were secretly influencing many painters, and gradually\\nbrightening every palette. Nobody, as yet, admitted it, but the first\\nblow had been dealt, and an evolution was beginning, which became more\\nperceptible at each succeeding Salon. And what a stroke it would be if,\\namidst the unconscious copies of impotent essayists, amidst the timid\\nartful attempts of tricksters, a master were suddenly to reveal himself,\\ngiving body to the new formula by dint of audacity and power, without\\ncompromise, showing it such as it should be, substantial, entire, so\\nthat it might become the truth of the end of the century!\\n\\nIn that first hour of passion and hope, Claude, usually so harassed by\\ndoubts, believed in his genius. He no longer experienced any of those\\ncrises, the anguish of which had driven him for days into the streets in\\nquest of his vanished courage. A fever stiffened him, he worked on with\\nthe blind obstinacy of an artist who dives into his entrails, to drag\\ntherefrom the fruit that tortures him. His long rest in the country had\\nendowed him with singular freshness of visual perception, and joyous\\ndelight in execution; he seemed to have been born anew to his art,\\nand endowed with a facility and balance of power he had never hitherto\\npossessed. He also felt certain of progress, and experienced great\\nsatisfaction at some successful bits of work, in which his former\\nsterile efforts at last culminated. As he had said at Bennecourt, he\\nhad got hold of his â\\x80\\x98open air,â\\x80\\x99 that carolling gaiety of tints which\\nastonished his comrades when they came to see him. They all admired,\\nconvinced that he would only have to show his work to take a very high\\nplace with it, such was its individuality of style, for the first time\\nshowing nature flooded with real light, amid all the play of reflections\\nand the constant variations of colours.\\n\\nThus, for three years, Claude struggled on, without weakening, spurred\\nto further efforts by each rebuff, abandoning nought of his ideas, but\\nmarching straight before him, with all the vigour of faith.\\n\\nDuring the first year he went forth amid the December snows to place\\nhimself for four hours a day behind the heights of Montmartre, at the\\ncorner of a patch of waste land whence as a background he painted some\\nmiserable, low, tumble-down buildings, overtopped by factory chimneys,\\nwhilst in the foreground, amidst the snow, he set a girl and a ragged\\nstreet rough devouring stolen apples. His obstinacy in painting from\\nnature greatly complicated his work, and gave rise to almost insuperable\\ndifficulties. However, he finished this picture out of doors; he merely\\ncleaned and touched it up a bit in his studio. When the canvas was\\nplaced beneath the wan daylight of the glazed roof, he himself was\\nstartled by its brutality. It showed like a scene beheld through a\\ndoorway open on the street. The snow blinded one. The two figures, of a\\nmuddy grey in tint, stood out, lamentable. He at once felt that such a\\npicture would not be accepted, but he did not try to soften it; he sent\\nit to the Salon, all the same. After swearing that he would never again\\ntry to exhibit, he now held the view that one should always present\\nsomething to the hanging committee if merely to accentuate its\\nwrong-doing. Besides, he admitted the utility of the Salon, the only\\nbattlefield on which an artist might come to the fore at one stroke. The\\nhanging committee refused his picture.\\n\\nThe second year Claude sought a contrast. He selected a bit of the\\npublic garden of Batignolles in May; in the background were some large\\nchestnut trees casting their shade around a corner of greensward and\\nseveral six-storied houses; while in front, on a seat of a crude green\\nhue, some nurses and petty cits of the neighbourhood sat in a line\\nwatching three little girls making sand pies. When permission to paint\\nthere had been obtained, he had needed some heroism to bring his work to\\na successful issue amid the bantering crowd. At last he made up his mind\\nto go there at five in the morning, in order to paint in the background;\\nreserving the figures, he contented himself with making mere sketches\\nof them from nature, and finishing them in his studio. This time his\\npicture seemed to him less crude; it had acquired some of the wan,\\nsoftened light which descended through the glass roof. He thought his\\npicture accepted, for all his friends pronounced it to be a masterpiece,\\nand went about saying that it would revolutionise the Salon. There\\nwas stupefaction and indignation when a fresh refusal of the hanging\\ncommittee was rumoured. The committeeâ\\x80\\x99s intentions could not be denied:\\nit was a question of systematically strangling an original artist. He,\\nafter his first burst of passion, vented all his anger upon his work,\\nwhich he stigmatised as false, dishonest, and execrable. It was a\\nwell-deserved lesson, which he should remember: ought he to have\\nrelapsed into that cellar-like studio light? Was he going to revert to\\nthe filthy cooking of imaginary figures? When the picture came back, he\\ntook a knife and ripped it from top to bottom.\\n\\nAnd so during the third year he obstinately toiled on a work of revolt.\\nHe wanted the blazing sun, that Paris sun which, on certain days, turns\\nthe pavement to a white heat in the dazzling reflection from the house\\nfrontages. Nowhere is it hotter; even people from burning climes mop\\ntheir faces; you would say you were in some region of Africa beneath the\\nheavily raining glow of a sky on fire. The subject Claude chose was a\\ncorner of the Place du Carrousel, at one oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon, when\\nthe sunrays fall vertically. A cab was jolting along, its driver half\\nasleep, its horse steaming, with drooping head, vague amid the throbbing\\nheat. The passers-by seemed, as it were, intoxicated, with the one\\nexception of a young woman, who, rosy and gay under her parasol, walked\\non with an easy queen-like step, as if the fiery element were her proper\\nsphere. But what especially rendered this picture terrible was a new\\ninterpretation of the effects of light, a very accurate decomposition\\nof the sunrays, which ran counter to all the habits of eyesight, by\\nemphasising blues, yellows and reds, where nobody had been accustomed to\\nsee any. In the background the Tuileries vanished in a golden shimmer;\\nthe paving-stones bled, so to say; the figures were only so many\\nindications, sombre patches eaten into by the vivid glare. This time his\\ncomrades, while still praising, looked embarrassed, all seized with\\nthe same apprehensions. Such painting could only lead to martyrdom. He,\\namidst their praises, understood well enough the rupture that was taking\\nplace, and when the hanging committee had once more closed the Salon\\nagainst him, he dolorously exclaimed, in a moment of lucidity:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right; itâ\\x80\\x99s an understood thing--Iâ\\x80\\x99ll die at the task.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, although his obstinate courage seemed to increase, he now and\\nthen gradually relapsed into his former doubts, consumed by the struggle\\nhe was waging with nature. Every canvas that came back to him seemed bad\\nto him--above all incomplete, not realising what he had aimed at. It was\\nthis idea of impotence that exasperated him even more than the refusals\\nof the hanging committee. No doubt he did not forgive the latter; his\\nworks, even in an embryo state, were a hundred times better than all\\nthe trash which was accepted. But what suffering he felt at being ever\\nunable to show himself in all his strength, in such a master-piece as he\\ncould not bring his genius to yield! There were always some superb bits\\nin his paintings. He felt satisfied with this, that, and the other. Why,\\nthen, were there sudden voids? Why were there inferior bits, which he\\ndid not perceive while he was at work, but which afterwards utterly\\nkilled the picture like ineffaceable defects? And he felt quite\\nunable to make any corrections; at certain moments a wall rose up, an\\ninsuperable obstacle, beyond which he was forbidden to venture. If he\\ntouched up the part that displeased him a score of times, so a score of\\ntimes did he aggravate the evil, till everything became quite muddled\\nand messy.\\n\\nHe grew anxious, and failed to see things clearly; his brush refused to\\nobey him, and his will was paralysed. Was it his hands or his eyes that\\nceased to belong to him amid those progressive attacks of the hereditary\\ndisorder that had already made him anxious? Those attacks became more\\nfrequent; he once more lapsed into horrible weeks, wearing himself out,\\noscillating betwixt uncertainty and hope; and his only support during\\nthose terrible hours, which he spent in a desperate hand-to-hand\\nstruggle with his rebellious work, was the consoling dream of his future\\nmasterpiece, the one with which he would at last be fully satisfied, in\\npainting which his hands would show all the energy and deftness of true\\ncreative skill. By some ever-recurring phenomenon, his longing to create\\noutstripped the quickness of his fingers; he never worked at one picture\\nwithout planning the one that was to follow. Then all that remained\\nto him was an eager desire to rid himself of the work on which he was\\nengaged, for it brought him torture; no doubt it would be good for\\nnothing; he was still making fatal concessions, having recourse to\\ntrickery, to everything that a true artist should banish from his\\nconscience. But what he meant to do after that--ah! what he meant to\\ndo--he beheld it superb and heroic, above attack and indestructible. All\\nthis was the everlasting mirage that goads on the condemned disciples\\nof art, a falsehood that comes in a spirit of tenderness and compassion,\\nand without which production would become impossible to those who die of\\ntheir failure to create life.\\n\\nIn addition to those constantly renewed struggles with himself, Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmaterial difficulties now increased. Was it not enough that he could not\\ngive birth to what he felt existing within him? Must he also battle with\\nevery-day cares? Though he refused to admit it, painting from nature in\\nthe open air became impossible when a picture was beyond a certain size.\\nHow could he settle himself in the streets amidst the crowd?--how obtain\\nfrom each person the necessary number of sittings? That sort of painting\\nmust evidently be confined to certain determined subjects, landscapes,\\nsmall corners of the city, in which the figures would be but so many\\nsilhouettes, painted in afterwards. There were also a thousand and one\\ndifficulties connected with the weather; the wind which threatened to\\ncarry off the easel, the rain which obliged one to interrupt oneâ\\x80\\x99s work.\\nOn such days Claude came home in a rage, shaking his fist at the sky\\nand accusing nature of resisting him in order that he might not take and\\nvanquish her. He also complained bitterly of being poor; for his dream\\nwas to have a movable studio, a vehicle in Paris, a boat on the Seine,\\nin both of which he would have lived like an artistic gipsy. But nothing\\ncame to his aid, everything conspired against his work.\\n\\nAnd Christine suffered with Claude. She had shared his hopes very\\nbravely, brightening the studio with her housewifely activity; but now\\nshe sat down, discouraged, when she saw him powerless. At each picture\\nwhich was refused she displayed still deeper grief, hurt in her womanly\\nself-love, taking that pride in success which all women have. The\\npainterâ\\x80\\x99s bitterness soured her also; she entered into his feelings and\\npassions, identified herself with his tastes, defended his painting,\\nwhich had become, as it were, part of herself, the one great concern of\\ntheir lives--indeed, the only important one henceforth, since it was the\\none whence she expected all her happiness. She understood well enough\\nthat art robbed her more and more of her lover each day, but the real\\nstruggle between herself and art had not yet begun. For the time she\\nyielded, and let herself be carried away with Claude, so that they\\nmight be but one--one only in the self-same effort. From that partial\\nabdication of self there sprang, however, a sadness, a dread of what\\nmight be in store for her later on. Every now and then a shudder chilled\\nher to the very heart. She felt herself growing old, while intense\\nmelancholy upset her, an unreasoning longing to weep, which she\\nsatisfied in the gloomy studio for hours together, when she was alone\\nthere.\\n\\nAt that period her heart expanded, as it were, and a mother sprang from\\nthe loving woman. That motherly feeling for her big artist child was\\nmade up of all the vague infinite pity which filled her with tenderness,\\nof the illogical fits of weakness into which she saw him fall each\\nhour, of the constant pardons which she was obliged to grant him. He was\\nbeginning to make her unhappy, his caresses were few and far between, a\\nlook of weariness constantly overspread his features. How could she love\\nhim then if not with that other affection of every moment, remaining in\\nadoration before him, and unceasingly sacrificing herself? In her inmost\\nbeing insatiable passion still lingered; she was still the sensuous\\nwoman with thick lips set in obstinately prominent jaws. Yet there was\\na gentle melancholy, in being merely a mother to him, in trying to make\\nhim happy amid that life of theirs which now was spoilt.\\n\\nLittle Jacques was the only one to suffer from that transfer of\\ntenderness. She neglected him more; the man, his father, became her\\nchild, and the poor little fellow remained as mere testimony of their\\ngreat passion of yore. As she saw him grow up, and no longer require so\\nmuch care, she began to sacrifice him, without intentional harshness,\\nbut merely because she felt like that. At meal-times she only gave\\nhim the inferior bits; the cosiest nook near the stove was not for his\\nlittle chair; if ever the fear of an accident made her tremble now\\nand then, her first cry, her first protecting movement was not for her\\nhelpless child. She ever relegated him to the background, suppressed\\nhim, as it were: â\\x80\\x98Jacques, be quiet; you tire your father. Jacques, keep\\nstill; donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that your father is at work?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe urchin suffered from being cooped up in Paris. He, who had had the\\nwhole country-side to roll about in, felt stifled in the narrow space\\nwhere he now had to keep quiet. His rosy cheeks became pale, he grew up\\npuny, serious, like a little man, with eyes which stared at things in\\nwonder. He was five by now, and his head by a singular phenomenon had\\nbecome disproportionately large, in such wise as to make his father say,\\nâ\\x80\\x98He has a great manâ\\x80\\x99s nut!â\\x80\\x99 But the childâ\\x80\\x99s intelligence seemed, on the\\ncontrary, to decrease in proportion as his skull became larger. Very\\ngentle and timid, he became absorbed in thought for hours, incapable of\\nanswering a question. And when he emerged from that state of immobility\\nhe had mad fits of shouting and jumping, like a young animal giving rein\\nto instinct. At such times warnings â\\x80\\x98to keep quietâ\\x80\\x99 rained upon him, for\\nhis mother failed to understand his sudden outbursts, and became uneasy\\nat seeing the father grow irritated as he sat before his easel. Getting\\ncross herself, she would then hastily seat the little fellow in his\\ncorner again. Quieted all at once, giving the startled shudder of one\\nwho has been too abruptly awakened, the child would after a time doze\\noff with his eyes wide open, so careless of enjoying life that his toys,\\ncorks, pictures, and empty colour-tubes dropped listlessly from his\\nhands. Christine had already tried to teach him his alphabet, but he\\nhad cried and struggled, so they had decided to wait another year or two\\nbefore sending him to school, where his masters would know how to make\\nhim learn.\\n\\nChristine at last began to grow frightened at the prospect of impending\\nmisery. In Paris, with that growing child beside them, living proved\\nexpensive, and the end of each month became terrible, despite her\\nefforts to save in every direction. They had nothing certain but\\nClaudeâ\\x80\\x99s thousand francs a year; and how could they live on fifty\\nfrancs a month, which was all that was left to them after deducting four\\nhundred francs for the rent? At first they had got out of embarrassment,\\nthanks to the sale of a few pictures, Claude having found Gagniereâ\\x80\\x99s old\\namateur, one of those detested bourgeois who possess the ardent souls\\nof artists, despite the monomaniacal habits in which they are confined.\\nThis one, M. Hue, a retired chief clerk in a public department, was\\nunfortunately not rich enough to be always buying, and he could only\\nbewail the purblindness of the public, which once more allowed a genius\\nto die of starvation; for he himself, convinced, struck by grace at the\\nfirst glance, had selected Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s crudest works, which he hung by the\\nside of his Delacroix, predicting equal fortune for them. The worst was\\nthat Papa Malgras had just retired after making his fortune. It was but\\na modest competence after all, an income of about ten thousand francs,\\nupon which he had decided to live in a little house at Bois Colombes,\\nlike the careful man he was.\\n\\nIt was highly amusing to hear him speak of the famous Naudet, full of\\ndisdain for the millions turned over by that speculator, â\\x80\\x98millions\\nthat would some day fall upon his nose,â\\x80\\x99 said Malgras. Claude, having\\ncasually met him, only succeeded in selling him a last picture, one of\\nhis sketches from the nude made at the Boutin studio, that superb study\\nof a womanâ\\x80\\x99s trunk which the erstwhile dealer had not been able to see\\nafresh without feeling a revival of his old passion for it. So misery\\nwas imminent; outlets were closing instead of new ones opening;\\ndisquieting rumours were beginning to circulate concerning the young\\npainterâ\\x80\\x99s works, so constantly rejected at the Salon; and besides,\\nClaudeâ\\x80\\x99s style of art, so revolutionary and imperfect, in which the\\nstartled eye found nought of admitted conventionality, would of itself\\nhave sufficed to drive away wealthy buyers. One evening, being unable\\nto settle his bill at his colour shop, the painter had exclaimed that he\\nwould live upon the capital of his income rather than lower himself to\\nthe degrading production of trade pictures. But Christine had violently\\nopposed such an extreme measure; she would retrench still further;\\nin short, she preferred anything to such madness, which would end by\\nthrowing them into the streets without even bread to eat.\\n\\nAfter the rejection of Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s third picture, the summer proved so\\nwonderfully fine that the painter seemed to derive new strength from\\nit. There was not a cloud; limpid light streamed day after day upon the\\ngiant activity of Paris. Claude had resumed his peregrinations through\\nthe city, determined to find a masterstroke, as he expressed it,\\nsomething huge, something decisive, he did not exactly know what.\\nSeptember came, and still he had found nothing that satisfied him;\\nhe simply went mad for a week about one or another subject, and then\\ndeclared that it was not the thing after all. His life was spent in\\nconstant excitement; he was ever on the watch, on the point of setting\\nhis hand on the realisation of his dream, which always flew away. In\\nreality, beneath his intractable realism lay the superstition of a\\nnervous woman; he believed in occult and complex influences; everything,\\nluck or ill-luck, must depend upon the view selected.\\n\\nOne afternoon--it was one of the last fine days of the season--Claude\\ntook Christine out with him, leaving little Jacques in the charge of the\\ndoorkeeper, a kind old woman, as was their wont when they wanted to go\\nout together. That day the young painter was possessed by a sudden whim\\nto ramble about and revisit in Christineâ\\x80\\x99s company the nooks beloved in\\nother days; and behind this desire of his there lurked a vague hope\\nthat she would bring him luck. And thus they went as far as the Pont\\nLouis-Philippe, and remained for a quarter of an hour on the Quai des\\nOrmes, silent, leaning against the parapet, and looking at the old Hotel\\ndu Martoy, across the Seine, where they had first loved each other.\\nThen, still without saying a word, they went their former round; they\\nstarted along the quays, under the plane trees, seeing the past rise up\\nbefore them at every step. Everything spread out again: the bridges\\nwith their arches opening upon the sheeny water; the Cite, enveloped in\\nshade, above which rose the flavescent towers of Notre-Dame; the\\ngreat curve of the right bank flooded with sunlight, and ending in the\\nindistinct silhouette of the Pavillon de Flore, together with the broad\\navenues, the monuments and edifices on both banks, and all the life of\\nthe river, the floating wash-houses, the baths, and the lighters.\\n\\nAs of old, the orb in its decline followed them, seemingly rolling along\\nthe distant housetops, and assuming a crescent shape, as it appeared\\nfrom behind the dome of the Institute. There was a dazzling sunset, they\\nhad never beheld a more magnificent one, such a majestic descent amidst\\ntiny cloudlets that changed into purple network, between the meshes of\\nwhich a shower of gold escaped. But of the past that thus rose up before\\ntheir eyes there came to them nought but invincible sadness--a sensation\\nthat things escaped them, and that it was impossible for them to retrace\\ntheir way up stream and live their life over again. All those old stones\\nremained cold. The constant current beneath the bridges, the water that\\nhad ever flowed onward and onward, seemed to have borne away something\\nof their own selves, the delight of early desire and the joyfulness of\\nhope. Now that they belonged to one another, they no longer tasted the\\nsimple happiness born of feeling the warm pressure of their arms as they\\nstrolled on slowly, enveloped by the mighty vitality of Paris.\\n\\nOn reaching the Pont des Saints-Peres, Claude, in sheer despair, stopped\\nshort. He had relinquished Christineâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and had turned his face\\ntowards the point of the Cite. She no doubt felt the severance that\\nwas taking place and became very sad. Seeing that he lingered there\\nobliviously, she wished to regain her hold upon him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My dear,â\\x80\\x99 said she, â\\x80\\x98let us go home; itâ\\x80\\x99s time. Jacques will be waiting\\nfor us, you know.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut he went half way across the bridge, and she had to follow him. Then\\nonce more he remained motionless, with his eyes still fixed on the Cite,\\non that island which ever rode at anchor, the cradle and heart of Paris,\\nwhere for centuries all the blood of her arteries had converged amid the\\nconstant growth of faubourgs invading the plain. And a glow came\\nover Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s face, his eyes sparkled, and at last he made a sweeping\\ngesture:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look! Look!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn the immediate foreground beneath them was the port of St. Nicolas,\\nwith the low shanties serving as offices for the inspectors of\\nnavigation, and the large paved river-bank sloping down, littered with\\npiles of sand, barrels, and sacks, and edged with a row of lighters,\\nstill full, in which busy lumpers swarmed beneath the gigantic arm of\\nan iron crane. Then on the other side of the river, above a cold\\nswimming-bath, resounding with the shouts of the last bathers of the\\nseason, the strips of grey linen that served as a roofing flapped in\\nthe wind. In the middle, the open stream flowed on in rippling, greenish\\nwavelets tipped here and there with white, blue, and pink. And then\\nthere came the Pont des Arts, standing back, high above the water on\\nits iron girders, like black lace-work, and animated by a ceaseless\\nprocession of foot-passengers, who looked like ants careering over the\\nnarrow line of the horizontal plane. Below, the Seine flowed away to\\nthe far distance; you saw the old arches of the Pont-Neuf, browny\\nwith stone-rust; on the left, as far as the Isle of St. Louis, came a\\nmirror-like gap; and the other arm of the river curved sharply, the lock\\ngates of the Mint shutting out the view with a bar of foam. Along the\\nPont-Neuf passed big yellow omnibuses, motley vehicles of all kinds,\\nwith the mechanical regularity of so many childrenâ\\x80\\x99s toys. The whole of\\nthe background was inframed within the perspective of the two banks; on\\nthe right were houses on the quays, partly hidden by a cluster of lofty\\ntrees, from behind which on the horizon there emerged a corner of the\\nHotel de Villa, together with the square clock tower of St. Gervais,\\nboth looking as indistinct as if they had stood far away in the suburbs.\\nAnd on the left bank there was a wing of the Institute, the flat\\nfrontage of the Mint, and yet another enfilade of trees.\\n\\nBut the centre of the immense picture, that which rose most prominently\\nfrom the stream and soared to the sky, was the Cite, showing like the\\nprow of an antique vessel, ever burnished by the setting sun. Down\\nbelow, the poplars on the strip of ground that joins the two sections\\nof the Pont-Neuf hid the statue of Henri IV. with a dense mass of green\\nfoliage. Higher up, the sun set the two lines of frontages in contrast,\\nwrapping the grey buildings of the Quai de lâ\\x80\\x99Horloge in shade, and\\nillumining with a blaze those of the Quai des Orfevres, rows of\\nirregular houses which stood out so clearly that one distinguished the\\nsmallest details, the shops, the signboards, even the curtains at the\\nwindows. Higher up, amid the jagged outlines of chimney stacks, behind a\\nslanting chess-board of smaller roofs, the pepper-caster turrets of the\\nPalais de Justice and the garrets of the Prefecture of Police displayed\\nsheets of slate, intersected by a colossal advertisement painted in blue\\nupon a wall, with gigantic letters which, visible to all Paris, seemed\\nlike some efflorescence of the feverish life of modern times sprouting\\non the cityâ\\x80\\x99s brow. Higher, higher still, betwixt the twin towers of\\nNotre-Dame, of the colour of old gold, two arrows darted upwards,\\nthe spire of the cathedral itself, and to the left that of the\\nSainte-Chapelle, both so elegantly slim that they seemed to quiver in\\nthe breeze, as if they had been the proud topmasts of the ancient vessel\\nrising into the brightness of the open sky.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you coming, dear?â\\x80\\x99 asked Christine, gently.\\n\\nClaude did not listen to her; this, the heart of Paris, had taken full\\npossession of him. The splendid evening seemed to widen the horizon.\\nThere were patches of vivid light, and of clearly defined shadow; there\\nwas a brightness in the precision of each detail, a transparency in the\\nair, which throbbed with gladness. And the river life, the turmoil of\\nthe quays, all the people, streaming along the streets, rolling over the\\nbridges, arriving from every side of that huge cauldron, Paris, steamed\\nthere in visible billows, with a quiver that was apparent in the\\nsunlight. There was a light breeze, high aloft a flight of small\\ncloudlets crossed the paling azure sky, and one could hear a slow\\nbut mighty palpitation, as if the soul of Paris here dwelt around its\\ncradle.\\n\\nBut Christine, frightened at seeing Claude so absorbed, and seized\\nherself with a kind of religious awe, took hold of his arm and dragged\\nhim away, as if she had felt that some great danger was threatening him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Let us go home. You are doing yourself harm. I want to get back.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt her touch he started like a man disturbed in sleep. Then, turning his\\nhead to take a last look, he muttered: â\\x80\\x98Ah! heavens! Ah! heavens, how\\nbeautiful!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe allowed himself to be led away. But throughout the evening, first\\nat dinner, afterwards beside the stove, and until he went to bed, he\\nremained like one dazed, so deep in his cogitations that he did not\\nutter half a dozen sentences. And Christine, failing to draw from him\\nany answer to her questions, at last became silent also. She looked\\nat him anxiously; was it the approach of some serious illness, had he\\ninhaled some bad air whilst standing midway across the bridge yonder?\\nHis eyes stared vaguely into space, his face flushed as if with\\nsome inner straining. One would have thought it the mute travail of\\ngermination, as if something were springing into life within him.\\n\\nThe next morning, immediately after breakfast, he set off, and Christine\\nspent a very sorrowful day, for although she had become more easy in\\nmind on hearing him whistle some of his old southern tunes as he got up,\\nshe was worried by another matter, which she had not mentioned to him\\nfor fear of damping his spirits again. That day they would for the first\\ntime lack everything; a whole week separated them from the date when\\ntheir little income would fall due, and she had spent her last copper\\nthat morning. She had nothing left for the evening, not even the\\nwherewithal to buy a loaf. To whom could she apply? How could she manage\\nto hide the truth any longer from him when he came home hungry? She\\nmade up her mind to pledge the black silk dress which Madame Vanzade\\nhad formerly given her, but it was with a heavy heart; she trembled with\\nfear and shame at the idea of the pawnshop, that familiar resort of the\\npoor which she had never as yet entered. And she was tortured by such\\napprehension about the future, that from the ten francs which were lent\\nher she only took enough to make a sorrel soup and a stew of potatoes.\\nOn coming out of the pawn-office, a meeting with somebody she knew had\\ngiven her the finishing stroke.\\n\\nAs it happened, Claude came home very late, gesticulating merrily, and\\nhis eyes very bright, as if he were excited by some secret joy; he was\\nvery hungry, and grumbled because the cloth was not laid. Then, having\\nsat down between Christine and little Jacques, he swallowed his soup and\\ndevoured a plateful of potatoes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is that all?â\\x80\\x99 he asked, when he had finished. â\\x80\\x98You might as well have\\nadded a scrap of meat. Did you have to buy some boots again?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe stammered, not daring to tell him the truth, but hurt at heart by\\nthis injustice. He, however, went on chaffing her about the coppers\\nshe juggled away to buy herself things with; and getting more and more\\nexcited, amid the egotism of feelings which he seemingly wished to keep\\nto himself, he suddenly flew out at Jacques.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hold your noise, you brat!--you drive one mad.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe child, forgetting all about his dinner, had been tapping the edge\\nof his plate with his spoon, his eyes full of mirthful delight at this\\nmusic.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Jacques, be quiet,â\\x80\\x99 scoldingly said his mother, in her turn. â\\x80\\x98Let your\\nfather have his dinner in peace.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen the little one, abashed, at once became very quiet, and relapsed\\ninto gloomy stillness, with his lustreless eyes fixed on his potatoes,\\nwhich, however, he did not eat.\\n\\nClaude made a show of stuffing himself with cheese, while Christine,\\nquite grieved, offered to fetch some cold meat from a ham and beef shop;\\nbut he declined, and prevented her going by words that pained her still\\nmore. Then, the table having been cleared, they all sat round the lamp\\nfor the evening, she sewing, the little one turning over a picture-book\\nin silence, and Claude drumming on the table with his fingers, his mind\\nthe while wandering back to the spot whence he had come. Suddenly he\\nrose, sat down again with a sheet of paper and a pencil, and began\\nsketching rapidly, in the vivid circle of light that fell from under the\\nlamp-shade. And such was his longing to give outward expression to the\\ntumultuous ideas beating in his skull, that soon this sketch did not\\nsuffice for his relief. On the contrary, it goaded him on, and he\\nfinished by unburthening his mind in a flood of words. He would have\\nshouted to the walls; and if he addressed himself to his wife it was\\nbecause she happened to be there.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what we saw yesterday. Itâ\\x80\\x99s magnificent. I spent three\\nhours there to-day. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got hold of what I want--something wonderful,\\nsomething thatâ\\x80\\x99ll knock everything else to pieces. Just look! I station\\nmyself under the bridge; in the immediate foreground I have the Port of\\nSt. Nicolas, with its crane, its lighters which are being unloaded, and\\nits crowd of labourers. Do you see the idea--itâ\\x80\\x99s Paris at work--all\\nthose brawny fellows displaying their bare arms and chests? Then on\\nthe other side I have the swimming-baths--Paris at play--and some skiff\\nthere, no doubt, to occupy the centre of the composition; but of that\\nI am not as yet certain. I must feel my way. As a matter of course, the\\nSeine will be in the middle, broad, immense.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhile talking, he kept on indicating outlines with his pencil,\\nthickening his strokes over and over again, and tearing the paper in\\nhis very energy. She, in order to please him, bent over the sketch,\\npretending to grow very interested in his explanations. But there was\\nsuch a labyrinth of lines, such a confusion of summary details, that she\\nfailed to distinguish anything.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are following me, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes, very beautiful indeed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then I have the background, the two arms of the rivet with their quays,\\nthe Cite, rising up triumphantly in the centre, and standing out against\\nthe sky. Ah! that background, what a marvel! People see it every day,\\npass before it without stopping; but it takes hold of one all the same;\\noneâ\\x80\\x99s admiration accumulates, and one fine afternoon it bursts forth.\\nNothing in the world can be grander; it is Paris herself, glorious in\\nthe sunlight. Ah! what a fool I was not to think of it before! How many\\ntimes I have looked at it without seeing! However, I stumbled on it\\nafter that ramble along the quays! And, do you remember, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a dash\\nof shadow on that side; while here the sunrays fall quite straight. The\\ntowers are yonder; the spire of the Sainte-Chapelle tapers upward, as\\nslim as a needle pointing to the sky. But no, itâ\\x80\\x99s more to the right.\\nWait, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe began again, never wearying, but constantly retouching the sketch,\\nand adding innumerable little characteristic details which his painterâ\\x80\\x99s\\neye had noticed; here the red signboard of a distant shop vibrated in\\nthe light; closer by was a greenish bit of the Seine, on whose surface\\nlarge patches of oil seemed to be floating; and then there was the\\ndelicate tone of a tree, the gamut of greys supplied by the house\\nfrontages, and the luminous cast of the sky. She complaisantly approved\\nof all he said and tried to look delighted.\\n\\nBut Jacques once again forgot what he had been told. After long\\nremaining silent before his book, absorbed in the contemplation of a\\nwood-cut depicting a black cat, he began to hum some words of his own\\ncomposition: â\\x80\\x98Oh, you pretty cat; oh, you ugly cat; oh, you pretty, ugly\\ncat,â\\x80\\x99 and so on, _ad infinitum_, ever in the same lugubrious manner.\\n\\nClaude, who was made fidgety by the buzzing noise, did not at first\\nunderstand what was upsetting him. But after a time the childâ\\x80\\x99s\\nharassing phrase fell clearly upon his ear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Havenâ\\x80\\x99t you done worrying us with your cat?â\\x80\\x99 he shouted furiously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hold your tongue, Jacques, when your father is talking!â\\x80\\x99 repeated\\nChristine.\\n\\nUpon my word, I do believe he is becoming an idiot. Just look at his\\nhead, if it isnâ\\x80\\x99t like an idiotâ\\x80\\x99s. Itâ\\x80\\x99s dreadful. Just say; what do you\\nmean by your pretty and ugly cat?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe little fellow, turning pale and wagging his big head, looked stupid,\\nand replied: â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t know.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, as his father and mother gazed at each other with a discouraged\\nair, he rested his cheek on the open picture-book, and remained like\\nthat, neither stirring nor speaking, but with his eyes wide open.\\n\\nIt was getting late; Christine wanted to put him to bed, but Claude had\\nalready resumed his explanations. He now told her that, the very next\\nmorning, he should go and make a sketch on the spot, just in order to\\nfix his ideas. And, as he rattled on, he began to talk of buying a small\\ncamp easel, a thing upon which he had set his heart for months. He kept\\nharping on the subject, and spoke of money matters till she at last\\nbecame embarrassed, and ended by telling him of everything--the last\\ncopper she had spent that morning, and the silk dress she had pledged\\nin order to dine that evening. Thereupon he became very remorseful\\nand affectionate; he kissed her and asked her forgiveness for having\\ncomplained about the dinner. She would excuse him, surely; he would have\\nkilled father and mother, as he kept on repeating, when that confounded\\npainting got hold of him. As for the pawn-shop, it made him laugh; he\\ndefied misery.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I tell you that we are all right,â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x98That picture means\\nsuccess.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe kept silent, thinking about her meeting of the morning, which she\\nwished to hide from him; but without apparent cause or transition, in\\nthe kind of torpor that had come over her, the words she would have kept\\nback rose invincibly to her lips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Madame Vanzade is dead,â\\x80\\x99 she said.\\n\\nHe looked surprised. Ah! really? How did she, Christine, know it?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I met the old man-servant. Oh, heâ\\x80\\x99s a gentleman by now, looking very\\nsprightly, in spite of his seventy years. I did not know him again. It\\nwas he who spoke to me. Yes, she died six weeks ago. Her millions have\\ngone to various charities, with the exception of an annuity to the\\nold servants, upon which they are living snugly like people of the\\nmiddle-classes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe looked at her, and at last murmured, in a saddened voice: â\\x80\\x98My poor\\nChristine, you are regretting things now, arenâ\\x80\\x99t you? She would have\\ngiven you a marriage portion, have found you a husband! I told you so in\\ndays gone by. She would, perhaps, have left you all her money, and you\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t now be starving with a crazy fellow like myself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe then seemed to wake from her dream. She drew her chair to his,\\ncaught hold of one of his arms and nestled against him, as if her whole\\nbeing protested against his words:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What are you saying? Oh! no; oh! no. It would have been shameful to\\nhave thought of her money. I would confess it to you if it were the\\ncase, and you know that I never tell lies; but I myself donâ\\x80\\x99t know what\\ncame over me when I heard the news. I felt upset and saddened, so sad\\nthat I imagined everything was over for me. It was no doubt remorse;\\nyes, remorse at having deserted her so brutally, poor invalid that she\\nwas, the good old soul who called me her daughter! I behaved very badly,\\nand it wonâ\\x80\\x99t bring me luck. Ah! donâ\\x80\\x99t say â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I feel it well enough;\\nhenceforth thereâ\\x80\\x99s an end to everything for me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen she wept, choked by those confused regrets, the significance of\\nwhich she failed to understand, regrets mingling with the one feeling\\nthat her life was spoilt, and that she now had nothing but unhappiness\\nbefore her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, wipe your eyes,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, becoming affectionate once more.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is it possible that you, who were never nervous, can conjure up\\nchimeras and worry yourself in this way? Dash it all, we shall get out\\nof our difficulties! First of all, you know that it was through you that\\nI found the subject for my picture. There cannot be much of a curse upon\\nyou, since you bring me luck.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe laughed, and she shook her head, seeing well enough that he wanted to\\nmake her smile. She was suffering on account of his picture already; for\\non the bridge he had completely forgotten her, as if she had ceased to\\nbelong to him! And, since the previous night, she had realised that he\\nwas farther and farther removed from her, alone in a world to which she\\ncould not ascend. But she allowed him to soothe her, and they exchanged\\none of their kisses of yore, before rising from the table to retire to\\nrest.\\n\\nLittle Jacques had heard nothing. Benumbed by his stillness, he had\\nfallen asleep, with his cheek on his picture-book; and his big head, so\\nheavy at times that it bent his neck, looked pale in the lamplight.\\nPoor little offspring of genius, which, when it begets at all, so often\\nbegets idiocy or physical imperfection! When his mother put him to bed\\nJacques did not even open his eyes.\\n\\nIt was only at this period that the idea of marrying Christine came\\nto Claude. Though yielding to the advice of Sandoz, who expressed\\nhis surprise at the prolongation of an irregular situation which no\\ncircumstances justified, he more particularly gave way to a feeling\\nof pity, to a desire to show himself kind to his mistress, and to win\\nforgiveness for his delinquencies. He had seen her so sad of late, so\\nuneasy with respect to the future, that he did not know how to revive\\nher spirits. He himself was growing soured, and relapsing into his\\nformer fits of anger, treating her, at times, like a servant, to whom\\none flings a weekâ\\x80\\x99s notice. Being his lawful wife, she would, no doubt,\\nfeel herself more in her rightful home, and would suffer less from his\\nrough behaviour. She herself, for that matter, had never again spoken\\nof marriage. She seemed to care nothing for earthly things, but entirely\\nreposed upon him; however, he understood well enough that it grieved\\nher that she was not able to visit at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s. Besides, they no longer\\nlived amid the freedom and solitude of the country; they were in Paris,\\nwith its thousand and one petty spites, everything that is calculated\\nto wound a woman in an irregular position. In reality, he had nothing\\nagainst marriage save his old prejudices, those of an artist who takes\\nlife as he lists. Since he was never to leave her, why not afford her\\nthat pleasure? And, in fact, when he spoke to her about it, she gave a\\nloud cry and threw her arms round his neck, surprised at experiencing\\nsuch great emotion. During a whole week it made her feel thoroughly\\nhappy. But her joy subsided long before the ceremony.\\n\\nMoreover, Claude did not hurry over any of the formalities, and they had\\nto wait a long while for the necessary papers. He continued getting the\\nsketches for his picture together, and she, like himself, did not seem\\nin the least impatient. What was the good? It would assuredly make no\\ndifference in their life. They had decided to be married merely at the\\nmunicipal offices, not in view of displaying any contempt for religion,\\nbut to get the affair over quickly and simply. That would suffice.\\nThe question of witnesses embarrassed them for a moment. As she was\\nabsolutely unacquainted with anybody, he selected Sandoz and Mahoudeau\\nto act for her. For a moment he had thought of replacing the latter by\\nDubuche, but he never saw the architect now, and he feared to compromise\\nhim. He, Claude, would be content with Jory and Gagniere. In that way\\nthe affair would pass off among friends, and nobody would talk of it.\\n\\nSeveral weeks had gone by; they were in December, and the weather proved\\nterribly cold. On the day before the wedding, although they barely had\\nthirty-five francs left them, they agreed that they could not send their\\nwitnesses away with a mere shake of the hand; and, rather than have\\na lot of trouble in the studio, they decided to offer them lunch at a\\nsmall restaurant on the Boulevard de Clichy, after which they would all\\ngo home.\\n\\nIn the morning, while Christine was tacking a collar to a grey linsey\\ngown which, with the coquetry of woman, she had made for the occasion,\\nit occurred to Claude, who was already wearing his frock-coat and\\nkicking his heels impatiently, to go and fetch Mahoudeau, for the\\nlatter, he asserted, was quite capable of forgetting all about the\\nappointment. Since autumn, the sculptor had been living at Montmartre,\\nin a small studio in the Rue des Tilleuls. He had moved thither in\\nconsequence of a series of affairs that had quite upset him. First\\nof all, he had been turned out of the fruitererâ\\x80\\x99s shop in the Rue du\\nCherche-Midi for not paying his rent; then had come a definite rupture\\nwith Chaine, who, despairing of being able to live by his brush, had\\nrushed into commercial enterprise, betaking himself to all the fairs\\naround Paris as the manager of a kind of â\\x80\\x98fortuneâ\\x80\\x99s wheelâ\\x80\\x99 belonging to\\na widow; while last of all had come the sudden flight of Mathilde, her\\nherbalistâ\\x80\\x99s business sold up, and she herself disappearing, it seemed,\\nwith some mysterious admirer. At present Mahoudeau lived all by himself\\nin greater misery than ever, only eating when he secured a job at\\nscraping some architectural ornaments, or preparing work for some more\\nprosperous fellow-sculptor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I am going to fetch him, do you hear?â\\x80\\x99 Claude repeated to Christine.\\nâ\\x80\\x98We still have a couple of hours before us. And, if the others come,\\nmake them wait. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll go to the municipal offices all together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOnce outside, Claude hurried along in the nipping cold which loaded\\nhis moustache with icicles. Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s studio was at the end of a\\nconglomeration of tenements--â\\x80\\x98rents,â\\x80\\x99 so to say--and he had to cross a\\nnumber of small gardens, white with rime, and showing the bleak, stiff\\nmelancholy of cemeteries. He could distinguish his friendâ\\x80\\x99s place from\\nafar on account of the colossal plaster statue of the â\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girl,â\\x80\\x99\\nthe once successful exhibit of the Salon, for which there had not been\\nsufficient space in the narrow ground-floor studio. Thus it was rotting\\nout in the open like so much rubbish shot from a cart, a lamentable\\nspectacle, weather-bitten, riddled by the rainâ\\x80\\x99s big, grimy tears. The\\nkey was in the door, so Claude went in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! have you come to fetch me?â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, in surprise. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nonly got my hat to put on. But wait a bit, I was asking myself whether\\nit wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be better to light a little fire. I am uneasy about my woman\\nthere.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSome water in a bucket was ice-bound. So cold was the studio that it\\nfroze inside as hard as it did out of doors, for, having been penniless\\nfor a whole week, Mahoudeau had gingerly eked out the little coal\\nremaining to him, only lighting the stove for an hour or two of a\\nmorning. His studio was a kind of tragic cavern, compared with which the\\nshop of former days evoked reminiscences of snug comfort, such was the\\ntomb-like chill that fell on oneâ\\x80\\x99s shoulders from the creviced ceiling\\nand the bare walls. In the various corners some statues, of less bulky\\ndimensions than the â\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girl,â\\x80\\x99 plaster figures which had been\\nmodelled with passion and exhibited, and which had then come back for\\nwant of buyers, seemed to be shivering with their noses turned to the\\nwall, forming a melancholy row of cripples, some already badly damaged,\\nshowing mere stumps of arms, and all dust-begrimed and clay-bespattered.\\nUnder the eyes of their artist creator, who had given them his heartâ\\x80\\x99s\\nblood, those wretched nudities dragged out years of agony. At first, no\\ndoubt, they were preserved with jealous care, despite the lack of room,\\nbut then they lapsed into the grotesque honor of all lifeless things,\\nuntil a day came when, taking up a mallet, he himself finished them off,\\nbreaking them into mere lumps of plaster, so as to be rid of them.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You say we have got two hours, eh?â\\x80\\x99 resumed Mahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll just\\nlight a bit of fire; it will be the wiser perhaps.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, while lighting the stove, he began bewailing his fate in an angry\\nvoice. What a dogâ\\x80\\x99s life a sculptorâ\\x80\\x99s was! The most bungling stonemason\\nwas better off. A figure which the Government bought for three thousand\\nfrancs cost well nigh two thousand, what with its model, clay, marble\\nor bronze, all sorts of expenses, indeed, and for all that it remained\\nburied in some official cellar on the pretext that there was no room\\nfor it elsewhere. The niches of the public buildings remained empty,\\npedestals were awaiting statues in the public gardens. No matter, there\\nwas never any room! And there were no possible commissions from private\\npeople; at best one received an order for a few busts, and at very rare\\nintervals one for a memorial statue, subscribed for by the public and\\nhurriedly executed at reduced terms. Sculpture was the noblest of arts,\\nthe most manly, yes, but the one which led the most surely to death by\\nstarvation!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is your machine progressing?â\\x80\\x99 asked Claude.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Without this confounded cold, it would be finished,â\\x80\\x99 answered\\nMahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show it you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe rose from his knees after listening to the snorting of the stove.\\nIn the middle of the studio, on a packing-case, strengthened by\\ncross-pieces, stood a statue swathed is linen wraps which were quite\\nrigid, hard frozen, draping the figure with the whiteness of a shroud.\\nThis statue embodied Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s old dream, unrealised until now from\\nlack of means--it was an upright figure of that bathing girl of whom\\nmore than a dozen small models had been knocking about his place for\\nyears. In a moment of impatient revolt he himself had manufactured\\ntrusses and stays out of broom-handles, dispensing with the necessary\\niron work in the hope that the wood would prove sufficiently solid.\\nFrom time to time he shook the figure to try it, but as yet it had not\\nbudged.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The devil!â\\x80\\x99 he muttered; â\\x80\\x98some warmth will do her good. These wraps\\nseem glued to her--they form quite a breastplate.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe linen was crackling between his fingers, and splinters of ice were\\nbreaking off. He was obliged to wait until the heat produced a slight\\nthaw, and then with great care he stripped the figure, baring the\\nhead first, then the bosom, and then the hips, well pleased at finding\\neverything intact, and smiling like a lover at a woman fondly adored.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, what do you think of it?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, who had only previously seen a little rough model of the statue,\\nnodded his head, in order that he might not have to answer immediately.\\nDecidedly, that good fellow Mahoudeau was turning traitor, and drifting\\ntowards gracefulness, in spite of himself, for pretty things ever sprang\\nfrom under his big fingers, former stonecutter though he was. Since\\nhis colossal â\\x80\\x98Vintaging Girl,â\\x80\\x99 he had gone on reducing and reducing the\\nproportions of his figures without appearing to be aware of it himself,\\nalways ready to stick out ferociously for the gigantic, which agreed\\nwith his temperament, but yielding to the partiality of his eyes for\\nsweetness and gracefulness. And indeed real nature broke at last through\\ninflated ambition. Exaggerated still, his â\\x80\\x98Bathing Girlâ\\x80\\x99 was already\\npossessed of great charm, with her quivering shoulders and her\\ntightly-crossed arms that supported her breast.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, you donâ\\x80\\x99t like her?â\\x80\\x99 he asked, looking annoyed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, yes, I do! I think you are right to tone things down a bit, seeing\\nthat you feel like that. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have a great success with this. Yes,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s evident it will please people very much.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMahoudeau, whom such praises would once have thrown into consternation,\\nseemed delighted. He explained that he wished to conquer public opinion\\nwithout relinquishing a tithe of his convictions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! dash it! it takes a weight off my mind to find you pleased,â\\x80\\x99 said\\nhe, â\\x80\\x98for I should have destroyed it if you had told me to do so, I\\ngive you my word! Another fortnightâ\\x80\\x99s work, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll sell my skin to no\\nmatter whom in order to pay the moulder. I say, I shall have a fine show\\nat the Salon, perhaps get a medal.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe laughed, waved his arms about, and then, breaking off:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As we are not in a hurry, sit down a bit. I want to get the wraps quite\\nthawed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe stove, which was becoming red hot, diffused great heat. The figure,\\nplaced close by, seemed to revive under the warm air that now crept up\\nher from her shins to her neck. And the two friends, who had sat down,\\ncontinued looking the statue full in the face, chatting about it and\\nnoting each detail. The sculptor especially grew excited in his delight,\\nand indulged in caressing gestures.\\n\\nAll at once, however, Claude fancied he was the victim of some\\nhallucination. To him the figure seemed to be moving; a quiver like\\nthe ripple of a wavelet crossed her stomach, and her left hip became\\nstraightened, as if the right leg were about to step out.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Have you noticed the smooth surface just about the loins?â\\x80\\x99 Mahoudeau\\nwent on, without noticing anything. â\\x80\\x98Ah, my boy, I took great pains over\\nthat!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut by degrees the whole statue was becoming animated. The loins swayed\\nand the bosom swelled, as with a deep sigh, between the parted arms. And\\nsuddenly the head drooped, the thighs bent, and the figure came forward\\nlike a living being, with all the wild anguish, the grief-inspired\\nspring of a woman who is flinging herself down.\\n\\nClaude at last understood things, when Mahoudeau uttered a terrible cry.\\nâ\\x80\\x98By heavens, sheâ\\x80\\x99s breaking to pieces!--she is coming down!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe clay, in thawing, had snapped the weak wooden trusses. There came a\\ncracking noise, as if bones indeed were splitting; and Mahoudeau, with\\nthe same passionate gesture with which he had caressed the figure from\\nafar, working himself into a fever, opened both arms, at the risk of\\nbeing killed by the fall. For a moment the bathing girl swayed to and\\nfro, and then with one crash came down on her face, broken in twain at\\nthe ankles, and leaving her feet sticking to the boards.\\n\\nClaude had jumped up to hold his friend back.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dash it! youâ\\x80\\x99ll be smashed!â\\x80\\x99 he cried.\\n\\nBut dreading to see her finish herself off on the floor, Mahoudeau\\nremained with hands outstretched. And the girl seemed to fling herself\\non his neck. He caught her in his arms, winding them tightly around her.\\nHer bosom was flattened against his shoulder and her thighs beat against\\nhis own, while her decapitated head rolled upon the floor. The shock was\\nso violent that Mahoudeau was carried off his legs and thrown over, as\\nfar back as the wall; and there, without relaxing his hold on the girlâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntrunk, he remained as if stunned lying beside her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! confound it!â\\x80\\x99 repeated Claude, furiously, believing that his friend\\nwas dead.\\n\\nWith great difficulty Mahoudeau rose to his knees, and burst into\\nviolent sobs. He had only damaged his face in the fall. Some blood\\ndribbled down one of his cheeks, mingling with his tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! curse poverty!â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s enough to make a fellow drown\\nhimself not to be able to buy a couple of rods! And there she is, there\\nshe is!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis sobs grew louder; they became an agonising wail; the painful\\nshrieking of a lover before the mutilated corpse of his affections. With\\nunsteady hands he touched the limbs lying in confusion around him; the\\nhead, the torso, the arms that had snapped in twain; above aught else\\nthe bosom, now caved in. That bosom, flattened, as if it had been\\noperated upon for some terrible disease, suffocated him, and he\\nunceasingly returned to it, probing the sore, trying to find the gash by\\nwhich life had fled, while his tears, mingled with blood, flowed freely,\\nand stained the statueâ\\x80\\x99s gaping wounds with red.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do help me!â\\x80\\x99 he gasped. â\\x80\\x98One canâ\\x80\\x99t leave her like this.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was overcome also, and his own eyes grew moist from a feeling\\nof artistic brotherliness. He hastened to his comradeâ\\x80\\x99s aide, but the\\nsculptor, after claiming his assistance, persisted in picking up the\\nremains by himself, as if dreading the rough handling of anybody else.\\nHe slowly crawled about on his knees, took up the fragments one by\\none, and put them together on a board. The figure soon lay there in its\\nentirety, as if it had been one of those girls who, committing suicide\\nfrom love, throw themselves from some monument and are shattered\\nby their fall, and put together again, looking both grotesque and\\nlamentable, to be carried to the Morgue. Mahoudeau, seated on the floor\\nbefore his statue, did not take his eyes from it, but became absorbed in\\nheart-rending contemplation. However, his sobs subsided, and at last\\nhe said with a long-drawn sigh: â\\x80\\x98I shall have to model her lying down!\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s no other way! Ah, my poor old woman, I had such trouble to set\\nher on her legs, and I thought her so grand like that!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut all at once Claude grew uneasy. What about his wedding? Mahoudeau\\nmust change his clothes. As he had no other frock-coat than the one he\\nwas wearing, he was obliged to make a jacket do. Then, the figure having\\nbeen covered with linen wraps once more, like a corpse over which a\\nsheet has been pulled, they both started off at a run. The stove was\\nroaring away, the thaw filled the whole studio with water, and slush\\nstreamed from the old dust-begrimed plaster casts.\\n\\nWhen they reached the Rue de Douai there was no one there except little\\nJacques, in charge of the doorkeeper. Christine, tired of waiting, had\\njust started off with the three others, thinking that there had been\\nsome mistake--that Claude might have told her that he would go straight\\nto the mayorâ\\x80\\x99s offices with Mahoudeau. The pair fell into a sharp trot,\\nbut only overtook Christine and their comrades in the Rue Drouot in\\nfront of the municipal edifice. They all went upstairs together, and\\nas they were late they met with a very cool reception from the usher on\\nduty. The wedding was got over in a few minutes, in a perfectly empty\\nroom. The mayor mumbled on, and the bride and bridegroom curtly uttered\\nthe binding â\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 while their witnesses were marvelling at the bad\\ntaste of the appointments of the apartment. Once outside, Claude took\\nChristineâ\\x80\\x99s arm again, and that was all.\\n\\nIt was pleasant walking in the clear frosty weather. Thus the party\\nquietly went back on foot, climbing the Rue des Martyrs to reach the\\nrestaurant on the Boulevard de Clichy. A small private room had been\\nengaged; the lunch was a very friendly affair, and not a word was\\nsaid about the simple formality that had just been gone through; other\\nsubjects were spoken of all the while, as at one of their customary\\ngatherings.\\n\\nIt was thus that Christine, who in reality was very affected despite\\nher pretended indifference, heard her husband and his friends excite\\nthemselves for three mortal hours about Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s unfortunate statue.\\nSince the others had been made acquainted with the story, they kept\\nharping on every particular of it. Sandoz thought the whole thing\\nvery wonderful; Jory and Gagniere discussed the strength of stays and\\ntrusses; the former mainly concerned about the monetary loss involved,\\nand the other demonstrating with a chair that the statue might have\\nbeen kept up. As for Mahoudeau, still very shaky and growing dazed; he\\ncomplained of a stiffness which he had not felt before; his limbs began\\nto hurt him, he had strained his muscles and bruised his skin as if he\\nhad been caught in the embrace of a stone siren. Christine washed the\\nscratch on his cheek, which had begun to bleed again, and it seemed to\\nher as if the mutilated bathing girl had sat down to table with them,\\nas if she alone was of any importance that day; for she alone seemed to\\ninterest Claude, whose narrative, repeated a score of times, was full of\\nendless particulars about the emotion he had felt on seeing that bosom\\nand those hips of clay shattered at his feet.\\n\\nHowever, at dessert there came a diversion, for Gagniere all at once\\nremarked to Jory:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98By the way, I saw you with Mathilde the day before yesterday. Yes, yes,\\nin the Rue Dauphine.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory, who had turned very red, tried to deny it; â\\x80\\x98Oh, a mere accidental\\nmeeting--honour bright!â\\x80\\x99 he stammered. â\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know where she hangs\\nout, or I would tell you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! is it you who are hiding her?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Mahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98Well, nobody\\nwants to see her again!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe truth was that Jory, throwing to the winds all his habits of\\nprudence and parsimony, was now secretly providing for Mathilde. She had\\ngained an ascendency over him by his vices.\\n\\nThey still lingered at table, and night was falling when they escorted\\nMahoudeau to his own door. Claude and Christine, on reaching home, took\\nJacques from the doorkeeper, and found the studio quite chilly, wrapped\\nin such dense gloom that they had to grope about for several minutes\\nbefore they were able to light the lamp. They also had to light the\\nstove again, and it struck seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock before they were able to draw\\nbreath at their ease. They were not hungry, so they merely finished the\\nremains of some boiled beef, mainly by way of encouraging the child to\\neat his soup; and when they had put him to bed, they settled themselves\\nwith the lamp betwixt them, as was their habit every evening.\\n\\nHowever, Christine had not put out any work, she felt too much moved to\\nsew. She sat there with her hands resting idly on the table, looking at\\nClaude, who on his side had at once become absorbed in a sketch, a\\nbit of his picture, some workmen of the Port Saint Nicolas, unloading\\nplaster. Invincible dreaminess came over the young woman, all sorts of\\nrecollections and regrets became apparent in the depths of her dim\\neyes; and by degrees growing sadness, great mute grief took absolute\\npossession of her, amid the indifference, the boundless solitude into\\nwhich she seemed to be drifting, although she was so near to Claude. He\\nwas, indeed, on the other side of the table, yet how far away she felt\\nhim to be! He was yonder before that point of the Cite, he was even\\nfarther still, in the infinite inaccessible regions of art; so far,\\nindeed, that she would now never more be able to join him! She several\\ntimes tried to start a conversation, but without eliciting any answer.\\nThe hours went by, she grew weary and numb with doing nothing, and she\\nended by taking out her purse and counting her money.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do you know how much we have to begin our married life with?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude did not even raise his head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Weâ\\x80\\x99ve nine sous. Ah! talk of poverty--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and finally growled: â\\x80\\x98We shall be rich some\\nday; donâ\\x80\\x99t fret.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen the silence fell again, and she did not even attempt to break it,\\nbut gazed at her nine coppers laid in a row upon the table. At last, as\\nit struck midnight, she shivered, ill with waiting and chilled by the\\ncold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s go to bed, dear,â\\x80\\x99 she murmured; â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m dead tired.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe, however, was working frantically, and did not even hear her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The fireâ\\x80\\x99s gone out,â\\x80\\x99 she began again, â\\x80\\x98we shall make ourselves ill;\\nletâ\\x80\\x99s go to bed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHer imploring voice reached him at last, and made him start with sudden\\nexasperation.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! go if you like! You can see very well that I want to finish\\nsomething!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe remained there for another minute, amazed by his sudden anger, her\\nface expressive of deep sorrow. Then, feeling that he would rather be\\nwithout her, that the very presence of a woman doing nothing upset him,\\nshe rose from the table and went off, leaving the door wide open. Half\\nan hour, three-quarters went by, nothing stirred, not a sound came from\\nher room; but she was not asleep, her eyes were staring into the gloom;\\nand at last she timidly ventured upon a final appeal, from the depths of\\nthe dark alcove.\\n\\nAn oath was the only reply she received. And nothing stirred after that.\\nShe perhaps dozed off. The cold in the studio grew keener, and the wick\\nof the lamp began to carbonise and burn red, while Claude, still bending\\nover his sketch, did not seem conscious of the passing minutes.\\n\\nAt two oâ\\x80\\x99clock, however, he rose up, furious to find the lamp going out\\nfor lack of oil. He only had time to take it into the other room, so\\nthat he might not have to undress in the dark. But his displeasure\\nincreased on seeing that Christineâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were wide open. He felt\\ninclined to complain of it. However, after some random remarks, he\\nsuddenly exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The most surprising thing is that her trunk wasnâ\\x80\\x99t hurt!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What do you mean?â\\x80\\x99 asked Christine, in amazement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s girl,â\\x80\\x99 he answered.\\n\\nAt this she shook nervously, turned and buried her face in the pillow;\\nand he was quite surprised on hearing her burst into sobs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! you are crying?â\\x80\\x99 he exclaimed.\\n\\nShe was choking, sobbing with heart-rending violence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with you?--Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said nothing to you. Come,\\ndarling, whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut, while he was speaking, the cause of her great grief dawned\\nupon him. No doubt, on a day like that, he ought to have shown more\\naffection; but his neglect was unintentional enough; he had not even\\ngiven the matter a thought. She surely knew him, said he; he became a\\ndownright brute when he was at work. Then he bent over and embraced her.\\nBut it was as if something irreparable had taken place, as if something\\nhad for ever snapped, leaving a void between them. The formality of\\nmarriage seemed to have killed love.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\nAS Claude could not paint his huge picture in the small studio of\\nthe Rue de Douai, he made up his mind to rent some shed that would be\\nspacious enough, elsewhere; and strolling one day on the heights of\\nMontmartre, he found what he wanted half way down the slope of the Rue\\nTourlaque, a street that descends abruptly behind the cemetery, and\\nwhence one overlooks Clichy as far as the marshes of Gennevilliers. It\\nhad been a dyerâ\\x80\\x99s drying shed, and was nearly fifty feet long and more\\nthan thirty broad, with walls of board and plaster admitting the wind\\nfrom every point of the compass. The place was let to him for three\\nhundred francs. Summer was at hand; he would soon work off his picture\\nand then quit.\\n\\nThis settled, feverish with hope, Claude decided to go to all the\\nnecessary expenses; as fortune was certain to come in the end, why\\ntrammel its advent by unnecessary scruples? Taking advantage of his\\nright, he broke in upon the principal of his income, and soon grew\\naccustomed to spend money without counting. At first he kept the matter\\nfrom Christine, for she had already twice stopped him from doing so;\\nand when he was at last obliged to tell her, she also, after a week of\\nreproaches and apprehension, fell in with it, happy at the comfort in\\nwhich she lived, and yielding to the pleasure of always having a little\\nmoney in her purse. Thus there came a few years of easy unconcern.\\n\\nClaude soon became altogether absorbed in his picture. He had furnished\\nthe huge studio in a very summary style: a few chairs, the old couch\\nfrom the Quai de Bourbon, and a deal table bought second-hand for five\\nfrancs sufficed him. In the practice of his art he was entirely devoid\\nof that vanity which delights in luxurious surroundings. The only real\\nexpense to which he went was that of buying some steps on castors, with\\na platform and a movable footboard. Next he busied himself about his\\ncanvas, which he wished to be six and twenty feet in length and sixteen\\nin height. He insisted upon preparing it himself; ordered a framework\\nand bought the necessary seamless canvas, which he and a couple of\\nfriends had all the work in the world to stretch properly by the aid\\nof pincers. Then he just coated the canvas with ceruse, laid on with a\\npalette-knife, refusing to size it previously, in order that it might\\nremain absorbent, by which method he declared that the painting would be\\nbright and solid. An easel was not to be thought of. It would not have\\nbeen possible to move a canvas of such dimensions on it. So he invented\\na system of ropes and beams, which held it slightly slanting against the\\nwall in a cheerful light. And backwards and forwards in front of the\\nbig white surface rolled the steps, looking like an edifice, like the\\nscaffolding by means of which a cathedral is to be reared.\\n\\nBut when everything was ready, Claude once more experienced misgivings.\\nAn idea that he had perhaps not chosen the proper light in which to\\npaint his picture fidgeted him. Perhaps an early morning effect would\\nhave been better? Perhaps, too, he ought to have chosen a dull day, and\\nso he went back to the Pont des Saint-Peres, and lived there for another\\nthree months.\\n\\nThe Cite rose up before him, between the two arms of the river, at all\\nhours and in all weather. After a late fall of snow he beheld it wrapped\\nin ermine, standing above mud-coloured water, against a light slatey\\nsky. On the first sunshiny days he saw it cleanse itself of everything\\nthat was wintry and put on an aspect of youth, when verdure sprouted\\nfrom the lofty trees which rose from the ground below the bridge. He\\nsaw it, too, on a somewhat misty day recede to a distance and almost\\nevaporate, delicate and quivering, like a fairy palace. Then, again,\\nthere were pelting rains, which submerged it, hid it as with a huge\\ncurtain drawn from the sky to the earth; storms, with lightning flashes\\nwhich lent it a tawny hue, the opaque light of some cut-throat place\\nhalf destroyed by the fall of the huge copper-coloured clouds; and there\\nwere winds that swept over it tempestuously, sharpening its angles and\\nmaking it look hard, bare, and beaten against the pale blue sky. Then,\\nagain, when the sunbeams broke into dust amidst the vapours of the\\nSeine, it appeared steeped in diffused brightness, without a shadow\\nabout it, lighted up equally on every side, and looking as charmingly\\ndelicate as a cut gem set in fine gold. He insisted on beholding it when\\nthe sun was rising and transpiercing the morning mists, when the Quai\\nde lâ\\x80\\x99Horloge flushes and the Quai des Orfevres remains wrapt in gloom;\\nwhen, up in the pink sky, it is already full of life, with the bright\\nawakening of its towers and spires, while night, similar to a falling\\ncloak, slides slowly from its lower buildings. He beheld it also at\\nnoon, when the sunrays fall on it vertically, when a crude glare bites\\ninto it, and it becomes discoloured and mute like a dead city, retaining\\nnought but the life of heat, the quiver that darts over its distant\\nhousetops. He beheld it, moreover, beneath the setting sun, surrendering\\nitself to the night which was slowly rising from the river, with the\\nsalient edges of its buildings still fringed with a glow as of embers,\\nand with final conflagrations rekindling in its windows, from whose\\npanes leapt tongue-like flashes. But in presence of those twenty\\ndifferent aspects of the Cite, no matter what the hour or the weather\\nmight be, he ever came back to the Cite that he had seen the first time,\\nat about four oâ\\x80\\x99clock one fine September afternoon, a Cite all serenity\\nunder a gentle breeze, a Cite which typified the heart of Paris beating\\nin the limpid atmosphere, and seemingly enlarged by the vast stretch of\\nsky which a flight of cloudlets crossed.\\n\\nClaude spent his time under the Pont des Saints-Peres, which he had\\nmade his shelter, his home, his roof. The constant din of the vehicles\\noverhead, similar to the distant rumbling of thunder, no longer\\ndisturbed him. Settling himself against the first abutment, beneath the\\nhuge iron arches, he took sketches and painted studies. The _employes_\\nof the river navigation service, whose offices were hard by, got to\\nknow him, and, indeed, the wife of an inspector, who lived in a sort\\nof tarred cabin with her husband, two children, and a cat, kept his\\ncanvases for him, to save him the trouble of carrying them to and fro\\neach day. It became his joy to remain in that secluded nook beneath\\nParis, which rumbled in the air above him, whose ardent life he ever\\nfelt rolling overhead. He at first became passionately interested in\\nPort St. Nicolas, with its ceaseless bustle suggesting that of a distant\\ngenuine seaport. The steam crane, _The Sophia_, worked regularly,\\nhauling up blocks of stone; tumbrels arrived to fetch loads of sand; men\\nand horses pulled, panting for breath on the big paving-stones, which\\nsloped down as far as the water, to a granite margin, alongside which\\ntwo rows of lighters and barges were moored. For weeks Claude worked\\nhard at a study of some lightermen unloading a cargo of plaster,\\ncarrying white sacks on their shoulders, leaving a white pathway behind\\nthem, and bepowdered with white themselves, whilst hard by the coal\\nremoved from another barge had stained the waterside with a huge inky\\nsmear. Then he sketched the silhouette of a swimming-bath on the left\\nbank, together with a floating wash-house somewhat in the rear, showing\\nthe windows open and the washerwomen kneeling in a row, on a level with\\nthe stream, and beating their dirty linen. In the middle of the river,\\nhe studied a boat which a waterman sculled over the stern; then,\\nfarther behind, a steamer of the towing service straining its chain, and\\ndragging a series of rafts loaded with barrels and boards up stream. The\\nprincipal backgrounds had been sketched a long while ago, still he did\\nseveral bits over again--the two arms of the Seine, and a sky all by\\nitself, into which rose only towers and spires gilded by the sun. And\\nunder the hospitable bridge, in that nook as secluded as some far-off\\ncleft in a rock, he was rarely disturbed by anybody. Anglers passed\\nby with contemptuous unconcern. His only companion was virtually the\\noverseerâ\\x80\\x99s cat, who cleaned herself in the sunlight, ever placid beneath\\nthe tumult of the world overhead.\\n\\nAt last Claude had all his materials ready. In a few days he threw off\\nan outline sketch of the whole, and the great work was begun. However,\\nthe first battle between himself and his huge canvas raged in the\\nRue Tourlaque throughout the summer; for he obstinately insisted\\nupon personally attending to all the technical calculations of his\\ncomposition, and he failed to manage them, getting into constant muddles\\nabout the slightest deviation from mathematical accuracy, of which he\\nhad no experience. It made him indignant with himself. So he let it\\ngo, deciding to make what corrections might be necessary afterwards. He\\ncovered his canvas with a rush--in such a fever as to live all day on\\nhis steps, brandishing huge brushes, and expending as much muscular\\nforce as if he were anxious to move mountains. And when evening came\\nhe reeled about like a drunken man, and fell asleep as soon as he had\\nswallowed his last mouthful of food. His wife even had to put him to\\nbed like a child. From those heroic efforts, however, sprang a masterly\\nfirst draught in which genius blazed forth amidst the somewhat chaotic\\nmasses of colour. Bongrand, who came to look at it, caught the painter\\nin his big arms, and stifled him with embraces, his eyes full of tears.\\nSandoz, in his enthusiasm, gave a dinner; the others, Jory, Mahoudeau\\nand Gagniere, again went about announcing a masterpiece. As for\\nFagerolles, he remained motionless before the painting for a moment,\\nthen burst into congratulations, pronouncing it too beautiful.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, subsequently, as if the irony of that successful trickster\\nhad brought him bad luck, Claude only spoilt his original draught.\\nIt was the old story over again. He spent himself in one effort, one\\nmagnificent dash; he failed to bring out all the rest; he did not know\\nhow to finish. He fell into his former impotence; for two years he lived\\nbefore that picture only, having no feeling for anything else. At times\\nhe was in a seventh heaven of exuberant joy; at others flung to earth,\\nso wretched, so distracted by doubt, that dying men gasping in their\\nbeds in a hospital were happier than himself. Twice already had he\\nfailed to be ready for the Salon, for invariably, at the last moment,\\nwhen he hoped to have finished in a few sittings, he found some void,\\nfelt his composition crack and crumble beneath his fingers. When the\\nthird Salon drew nigh, there came a terrible crisis; he remained for a\\nfortnight without going to his studio in the Rue Tourlaque, and when\\nhe did so, it was as to a house desolated by death. He turned the huge\\ncanvas to the wall and rolled his steps into a corner; he would have\\nsmashed and burned everything if his faltering hands had found strength\\nenough. Nothing more existed; amid a blast of anger he swept the floor\\nclean, and spoke of setting to work at little things, since he was\\nincapable of perfecting paintings of any size.\\n\\nIn spite of himself, his first idea of a picture on a smaller scale\\ntook him back to the Cite. Why should not he paint a simple view, on\\na moderate sized canvas? But a kind of shame, mingled with strange\\njealousy, prevented him from settling himself in his old spot under the\\nPont des Saints-Peres. It seemed to him as if that spot were sacred now;\\nthat he ought not to offer any outrage to his great work, dead as it\\nwas. So he stationed himself at the end of the bank, above the bridge.\\nThis time, at any rate, he would work directly from nature; and he felt\\nhappy at not having to resort to any trickery, as was unavoidable with\\nworks of a large size. The small picture, very carefully painted, more\\nhighly finished than usual, met, however, with the same fate as the\\nothers before the hanging committee, who were indignant with this style\\nof painting, executed with a tipsy brush, as was said at the time in\\nthe studios. The slap in the face which Claude thus received was all the\\nmore severe, as a report had spread of concessions, of advances made by\\nhim to the School of Arts, in order that his work might be received.\\nAnd when the picture came back to him, he, deeply wounded, weeping with\\nrage, tore it into narrow shreds, which he burned in his stove. It was\\nnot sufficient that he should kill that one with a knife-thrust, it must\\nbe annihilated.\\n\\nAnother year went by for Claude in desultory toil. He worked from force\\nof habit, but finished nothing; he himself saying, with a dolorous\\nlaugh, that he had lost himself, and was trying to find himself again.\\nIn reality, tenacious consciousness of his genius left him a hope which\\nnothing could destroy, even during his longest crises of despondency. He\\nsuffered like some one damned, for ever rolling the rock which slipped\\nback and crushed him; but the future remained, with the certainty of one\\nday seizing that rock in his powerful arms and flinging it upward to the\\nstars. His friends at last beheld his eyes light up with passion once\\nmore. It was known that he again secluded himself in the Rue Tourlaque.\\nHe who formerly had always been carried beyond the work on which he was\\nengaged, by some dream of a picture to come, now stood at bay before\\nthat subject of the Cite. It had become his fixed idea--the bar that\\nclosed up his life. And soon he began to speak freely of it again in a\\nnew blaze of enthusiasm, exclaiming, with childish delight, that he had\\nfound his way and that he felt certain of victory.\\n\\nOne day Claude, who, so far, had not opened his door to his friends,\\ncondescended to admit Sandoz. The latter tumbled upon a study with a\\ndeal of dash in it, thrown off without a model, and again admirable in\\ncolour. The subject had remained the same--the Port St. Nicolas on\\nthe left, the swimming-baths on the right, the Seine and Cite in the\\nbackground. But Sandoz was amazed at perceiving, instead of the boat\\nsculled by a waterman, another large skiff taking up the whole centre\\nof the composition--a skiff occupied by three women. One, in a bathing\\ncostume, was rowing; another sat over the edge with her legs dangling in\\nthe water, her costume partially unfastened, showing her bare shoulder;\\nwhile the third stood erect and nude at the prow, so bright in tone that\\nshe seemed effulgent, like the sun.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, what an idea!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98What are those women doing\\nthere?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, they are bathing,â\\x80\\x99 Claude quietly answered. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t you see that\\nthey have come out of the swimming-baths? It supplies me with a motive\\nfor the nude; itâ\\x80\\x99s a real find, eh? Does it shock you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis old friend, who knew him well by now, dreaded lest he should give\\nhim cause for discouragement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I? Oh, no! Only I am afraid that the public will again fail\\nto understand. That nude woman in the very midst of Paris--itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nimprobable.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude looked naively surprised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! you think so? Well, so much the worse. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the odds, as long as\\nthe woman is well painted? Besides, I need something like that to get my\\ncourage up.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn the following occasions, Sandoz gently reverted to the strangeness\\nof the composition, pleading, as was his nature, the cause of outraged\\nlogic. How could a modern painter who prided himself on painting merely\\nwhat was real--how could he so bastardise his work as to introduce\\nfanciful things into it? It would have been so easy to choose another\\nsubject, in which the nude would have been necessary. But Claude became\\nobstinate, and resorted to lame and violent explanations, for he would\\nnot avow his real motive: an idea which had come to him and which he\\nwould have been at a loss to express clearly. It was, however, a longing\\nfor some secret symbolism. A recrudescence of romanticism made him see\\nan incarnation of Paris in that nude figure; he pictured the city bare\\nand impassioned, resplendent with the beauty of woman.\\n\\nBefore the pressing objections of his friend he pretended to be shaken\\nin his resolutions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll dress my old woman later on, since she worries\\nyou,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98But meanwhile I shall do her like that. You understand,\\nshe amuses me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe never reverted to the subject again, remaining silently obstinate,\\nmerely shrugging his shoulders and smiling with embarrassment whenever\\nany allusion betrayed the general astonishment which was felt at the\\nsight of that Venus emerging triumphantly from the froth of the Seine\\namidst all the omnibuses on the quays and the lightermen working at the\\nPort of St. Nicolas.\\n\\nSpring had come round again, and Claude had once more resolved to work\\nat his large picture, when in a spirit of prudence he and Christine\\nmodified their daily life. She, at times, could not help feeling uneasy\\nat seeing all their money so quickly spent. Since the supply had seemed\\ninexhaustible, they had ceased counting. But, at the end of four years,\\nthey had woke up one morning quite frightened, when, on asking for\\naccounts, they found that barely three thousand francs were left out\\nof the twenty thousand. They immediately reverted to severe economy,\\nstinting themselves as to bread, planning the cutting down of the most\\nelementary expenses; and it was thus that, in the first impulse of\\nself-sacrifice, they left the Rue de Douai. What was the use of paying\\ntwo rents? There was room enough in the old drying-shed in the Rue\\nTourlaque--still stained with the dyes of former days--to afford\\naccommodation for three people. Settling there was, nevertheless, a\\ndifficult affair; for however big the place was, it provided them, after\\nall, with but one room. It was like a gipsyâ\\x80\\x99s shed, where everything had\\nto be done in common. As the landlord was unwilling, the painter himself\\nhad to divide it at one end by a partition of boards, behind which\\nhe devised a kitchen and a bedroom. They were then delighted with the\\nplace, despite the chinks through which the wind blew, and although\\non rainy days they had to set basins beneath the broader cracks in the\\nroof. The whole looked mournfully bare; their few poor sticks seemed to\\ndance alongside the naked walls. They themselves pretended to be proud\\nat being lodged so spaciously; they told their friends that Jacques\\nwould at least have a little room to run about. Poor Jacques, in spite\\nof his nine years, did not seem to be growing; his head alone became\\nlarger and larger. They could not send him to school for more than a\\nweek at a stretch, for he came back absolutely dazed, ill from having\\ntried to learn, in such wise that they nearly always allowed him to live\\non all fours around them, crawling from one corner to another.\\n\\nChristine, who for quite a long while had not shared Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s daily\\nwork, now once more found herself beside him throughout his long hours\\nof toil. She helped him to scrape and pumice the old canvas of the big\\npicture, and gave him advice about attaching it more securely to the\\nwall. But they found that another disaster had befallen them--the steps\\nhad become warped by the water constantly trickling through the roof,\\nand, for fear of an accident, Claude had to strengthen them with an oak\\ncross-piece, she handing him the necessary nails one by one. Then once\\nmore, and for the second time, everything was ready. She watched him\\nagain outlining the work, standing behind him the while, till she\\nfelt faint with fatigue, and finally dropping to the floor, where she\\nremained squatting, and still looking at him.\\n\\nAh! how she would have liked to snatch him from that painting which had\\nseized hold of him! It was for that purpose that she made herself his\\nservant, only too happy to lower herself to a labourerâ\\x80\\x99s toil. Since she\\nshared his work again, since the three of them, he, she, and the canvas,\\nwere side by side, her hope revived. If he had escaped her when she, all\\nalone, cried her eyes out in the Rue de Douai, if he lingered till late\\nin the Rue Tourlaque, fascinated as by a mistress, perhaps now that she\\nwas present she might regain her hold over him. Ah, painting, painting!\\nin what jealous hatred she held it! Hers was no longer the revolt of a\\ngirl of the bourgeoisie, who painted neatly in water-colours, against\\nindependent, brutal, magnificent art. No, little by little she had come\\nto understand it, drawn towards it at first by her love for the painter,\\nand gained over afterwards by the feast of light, by the original charm\\nof the bright tints which Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s works displayed. And now she had\\naccepted everything, even lilac-tinted soil and blue trees. Indeed, a\\nkind of respect made her quiver before those works which had at first\\nseemed so horrid to her. She recognised their power well enough, and\\ntreated them like rivals about whom one could no longer joke. But her\\nvindictiveness grew in proportion to her admiration; she revolted at\\nhaving to stand by and witness, as it were, a diminution of herself, the\\nblow of another love beneath her own roof.\\n\\nAt first there was a silent struggle of every minute. She thrust herself\\nforward, interposed whatever she could, a hand, a shoulder, between the\\npainter and his picture. She was always there, encompassing him with her\\nbreath, reminding him that he was hers. Then her old idea revived--she\\nalso would paint; she would seek and join him in the depths of his art\\nfever. Every day for a whole month she put on a blouse, and worked like\\na pupil by the side of a master, diligently copying one of his sketches,\\nand she only gave in when she found the effort turn against her\\nobject; for, deceived, as it were, by their joint work, he finished by\\nforgetting that she was a woman, and lived with her on a footing of mere\\ncomradeship as between man and man. Accordingly she resorted to what was\\nher only strength.\\n\\nTo perfect some of the small figures of his latter pictures, Claude had\\nmany a time already taken the hint of a head, the pose of an arm, the\\nattitude of a body from Christine. He threw a cloak over her shoulders,\\nand caught her in the posture he wanted, shouting to her not to stir.\\nThese were little services which she showed herself only too pleased to\\nrender him, but she had not hitherto cared to go further, for she was\\nhurt by the idea of being a model now that she was his wife. However,\\nsince Claude had broadly outlined the large upright female figure which\\nwas to occupy the centre of his picture, Christine had looked at the\\nvague silhouette in a dreamy way, worried by an ever-pursuing thought\\nbefore which all scruples vanished. And so, when he spoke of taking a\\nmodel, she offered herself, reminding him that she had posed for the\\nfigure in the â\\x80\\x98Open Airâ\\x80\\x99 subject, long ago. â\\x80\\x98A model,â\\x80\\x99 she added, â\\x80\\x98would\\ncost you seven francs a sitting. We are not so rich, we may as well save\\nthe money.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe question of economy decided him at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m agreeable, and itâ\\x80\\x99s even very good of you to show such courage, for\\nyou know that it is not a bit of pastime to sit for me. Never mind, you\\nhad better confess to it, you big silly, you are afraid of another woman\\ncoming here; you are jealous.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJealous! Yes, indeed she was jealous, so she suffered agony. But she\\nsnapped her fingers at other women; all the models in Paris might have\\nsat to him for what she cared. She had but one rival, that painting,\\nthat art which robbed her of him.\\n\\nClaude, who was delighted, at first made a study, a simple academic\\nstudy, in the attitude required for his picture. They waited until\\nJacques had gone to school, and the sitting lasted for hours. During\\nthe earlier days Christine suffered a great deal from being obliged to\\nremain in the same position; then she grew used to it, not daring to\\ncomplain, lest she might vex him, and even restraining her tears when\\nhe roughly pushed her about. And he soon acquired the habit of doing so,\\ntreating her like a mere model; more exacting with her, however, than if\\nhe had paid her, never afraid of unduly taxing her strength, since she\\nwas his wife. He employed her for every purpose, at every minute, for an\\narm, a foot, the most trifling detail that he stood in need of. And thus\\nin a way he lowered her to the level of a â\\x80\\x98living lay figure,â\\x80\\x99 which he\\nstuck in front of him and copied as he might have copied a pitcher or a\\nstew-pan for a bit of still life.\\n\\nThis time Claude proceeded leisurely, and before roughing in the large\\nfigure he tired Christine for months by making her pose in twenty\\ndifferent ways. At last, one day, he began the roughing in. It was an\\nautumnal morning, the north wind was already sharp, and it was by no\\nmeans warm even in the big studio, although the stove was roaring. As\\nlittle Jacques was poorly again and unable to go to school, they had\\ndecided to lock him up in the room at the back, telling him to be very\\ngood. And then the mother settled herself near the stove, motionless, in\\nthe attitude required.\\n\\nDuring the first hour, the painter, perched upon his steps, kept\\nglancing at her, but did not speak a word. Unutterable sadness stole\\nover her, and she felt afraid of fainting, no longer knowing whether she\\nwas suffering from the cold or from a despair that had come from afar,\\nand the bitterness of which she felt to be rising within her. Her\\nfatigue became so great that she staggered and hobbled about on her\\nnumbed legs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, already?â\\x80\\x99 cried Claude. â\\x80\\x98Why, you havenâ\\x80\\x99t been at it more than a\\nquarter of an hour. You donâ\\x80\\x99t want to earn your seven francs, then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was joking in a gruff voice, delighted with his work. And she had\\nscarcely recovered the use of her limbs, beneath the dressing-gown she\\nhad wrapped round her, when he went on shouting: â\\x80\\x98Come on, come on, no\\nidling! Itâ\\x80\\x99s a grand day to-day is! I must either show some genius or\\nelse kick the bucket.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, in a weary way, she at last resumed the pose.\\n\\nThe misfortune was that before long, both by his glances and the\\nlanguage he used, she fully realised that she herself was as nothing to\\nhim. If ever he praised a limb, a tint, a contour, it was solely from\\nthe artistic point of view. Great enthusiasm and passion he often\\nshowed, but it was not passion for herself as in the old days. She felt\\nconfused and deeply mortified. Ah! this was the end; in her he no longer\\nloved aught but his art, the example of nature and life! And then,\\nwith her eyes gazing into space, she would remain rigid, like a statue,\\nkeeping back the tears which made her heart swell, lacking even the\\nwretched consolation of being able to cry. And day by day the same sorry\\nlife began afresh for her. To stand there as his model had become her\\nprofession. She could not refuse, however bitter her grief. Their once\\nhappy life was all over, there now seemed to be three people in the\\nplace; it was as if Claude had introduced a mistress into it--that woman\\nhe was painting. The huge picture rose up between them, parted them as\\nwith a wall, beyond which he lived with the other. That duplication of\\nherself well nigh drove Christine mad with jealousy, and yet she was\\nconscious of the pettiness of her sufferings, and did not dare to\\nconfess them lest he should laugh at her. However, she did not deceive\\nherself; she fully realised that he preferred her counterfeit to\\nherself, that her image was the worshipped one, the sole thought, the\\naffection of his every hour. He almost killed her with long sittings in\\nthat cold draughty studio, in order to enhance the beauty of the other;\\nupon whom depended all his joys and sorrows according as to whether he\\nbeheld her live or languish beneath his brush. Was not this love?\\nAnd what suffering to have to lend herself so that the other might be\\ncreated, so that she might be haunted by a nightmare of that rival, so\\nthat the latter might for ever rise between them, more powerful than\\nreality! To think of it! So much dust, the veriest trifle, a patch\\nof colour on a canvas, a mere semblance destroying all their\\nhappiness!--he, silent, indifferent, brutal at times, and she, tortured\\nby his desertion, in despair at being unable to drive away that creature\\nwho ever encroached more and more upon their daily life!\\n\\nAnd it was then that Christine, finding herself altogether beaten in her\\nefforts to regain Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s love, felt all the sovereignty of art weigh\\ndown upon her. That painting, which she had already accepted without\\nrestriction, she raised still higher in her estimation, placed inside an\\nawesome tabernacle before which she remained overcome, as before those\\npowerful divinities of wrath which one honours from the very hatred\\nand fear that they inspire. Hers was a holy awe, a conviction that\\nstruggling was henceforth useless, that she would be crushed like a\\nbit of straw if she persisted in her obstinacy. Each of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncanvases became magnified in her eyes, the smallest assumed triumphal\\ndimensions, even the worst painted of them overwhelmed her with victory,\\nand she no longer judged them, but grovelled, trembling, thinking them\\nall formidable, and invariably replying to Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s questions:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, yes; very good! Oh, superb! Oh, very, very extraordinary that one!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNevertheless, she harboured no anger against him; she still worshipped\\nhim with tearful tenderness, as she saw him thus consume himself with\\nefforts. After a few weeks of successful work, everything got spoilt\\nagain; he could not finish his large female figure. At times he almost\\nkilled his model with fatigue, keeping hard at work for days and days\\ntogether, then leaving the picture untouched for a whole month. The\\nfigure was begun anew, relinquished, painted all over again at least a\\ndozen times. One year, two years went by without the picture reaching\\ncompletion. Though sometimes it was almost finished, it was scratched\\nout the next morning and painted entirely over again.\\n\\nAh! what an effort of creation it was, an effort of blood and tears,\\nfilling Claude with agony in his attempt to beget flesh and instil life!\\nEver battling with reality, and ever beaten, it was a struggle with the\\nAngel. He was wearing himself out with this impossible task of making a\\ncanvas hold all nature; he became exhausted at last with the pains\\nwhich racked his muscles without ever being able to bring his genius\\nto fruition. What others were satisfied with, a more or less faithful\\nrendering, the various necessary bits of trickery, filled him with\\nremorse, made him as indignant as if in resorting to such practices one\\nwere guilty of ignoble cowardice; and thus he began his work over and\\nover again, spoiling what was good through his craving to do better.\\nHe would always be dissatisfied with his women--so his friends jokingly\\ndeclared--until they flung their arms round his neck. What was lacking\\nin his power that he could not endow them with life? Very little, no\\ndoubt. Sometimes he went beyond the right point, sometimes he stopped\\nshort of it. One day the words, â\\x80\\x98an incomplete genius,â\\x80\\x99 which he\\noverheard, both flattered and frightened him. Yes, it must be that; he\\njumped too far or not far enough; he suffered from a want of nervous\\nbalance; he was afflicted with some hereditary derangement which,\\nbecause there were a few grains the more or the less of some substance\\nin his brain, was making him a lunatic instead of a great man. Whenever\\na fit of despair drove him from his studio, whenever he fled from his\\nwork, he now carried about with him that idea of fatal impotence, and\\nhe heard it beating against his skull like the obstinate tolling of a\\nfuneral bell.\\n\\nHis life became wretched. Never had doubt of himself pursued him in that\\nway before. He disappeared for whole days together; he even stopped out\\na whole night, coming back the next morning stupefied, without being\\nable to say where he had gone. It was thought that he had been tramping\\nthrough the outskirts of Paris rather than find himself face to face\\nwith his spoilt work. His sole relief was to flee the moment that work\\nfilled him with shame and hatred, and to remain away until he felt\\nsufficient courage to face it once more. And not even his wife dared to\\nquestion him on his return--indeed, she was only too happy to see him\\nback again after her anxious waiting. At such times he madly scoured\\nParis, especially the outlying quarters, from a longing to debase\\nhimself and hob-nob with labourers. He expressed at each recurring\\ncrisis his old regret at not being some masonâ\\x80\\x99s hodman. Did not\\nhappiness consist in having solid limbs, and in performing the work one\\nwas built for well and quickly? He had wrecked his life; he ought to\\nhave got himself engaged in the building line in the old times when he\\nhad lunched at the â\\x80\\x98Dog of Montargis,â\\x80\\x99 Gomardâ\\x80\\x99s tavern, where he had\\nknown a Limousin, a big, strapping, merry fellow, whose brawny arms he\\nenvied. Then, on coming back to the Rue Tourlaque, with his legs faint\\nand his head empty, he gave his picture much the same distressful,\\nfrightened glance as one casts at a corpse in a mortuary, until fresh\\nhope of resuscitating it, of endowing it with life, brought a flush to\\nhis face once more.\\n\\nOne day Christine was posing, and the figure of the woman was again\\nwell nigh finished. For the last hour, however, Claude had been growing\\ngloomy, losing the childish delight that he had displayed at the\\nbeginning of the sitting. So his wife scarcely dared to breathe, feeling\\nby her own discomfort that everything must be going wrong once more, and\\nafraid that she might accelerate the catastrophe if she moved as much\\nas a finger. And, surely enough, he suddenly gave a cry of anguish, and\\nlaunched forth an oath in a thunderous voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, curse it! curse it!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had flung his handful of brushes from the top of the steps. Then,\\nblinded with rage, with one blow of his fist he transpierced the canvas.\\n\\nChristine held out her trembling hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My dear, my dear!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut when she had flung a dressing-gown over her shoulders, and\\napproached the picture, she experienced keen delight, a burst of\\nsatisfied hatred. Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s fist had struck â\\x80\\x98the other oneâ\\x80\\x99 full in the\\nbosom, and there was a gaping hole! At last, then, that other one was\\nkilled!\\n\\nMotionless, horror-struck by that murder, Claude stared at the\\nperforated bosom. Poignant grief came upon him at the sight of the wound\\nwhence the blood of his work seemed to flow. Was it possible? Was it\\nhe who had thus murdered what he loved best of all on earth? His anger\\nchanged into stupor; his fingers wandered over the canvas, drawing the\\nragged edges of the rent together, as if he had wished to close the\\nbleeding gash. He was choking; he stammered, distracted with boundless\\ngrief:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98She is killed, she is killed!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Christine, in her maternal love for that big child of an artist,\\nfelt moved to her very entrails. She forgave him as usual. She saw well\\nenough that he now had but one thought--to mend the rent, to repair\\nthe evil at once; and she helped him; it was she who held the shreds\\ntogether, whilst he from behind glued a strip of canvas against them.\\nWhen she dressed herself, â\\x80\\x98the other oneâ\\x80\\x99 was there again, immortal,\\nsimply retaining near her heart a slight scar, which seemed to make her\\ndoubly dear to the painter.\\n\\nAs this unhinging of Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s faculties increased, he drifted into a\\nsort of superstition, into a devout belief in certain processes and\\nmethods. He banished oil from his colours, and spoke of it as of a\\npersonal enemy. On the other hand, he held that turpentine produced a\\nsolid unpolished surface, and he had some secrets of his own which\\nhe hid from everybody; solutions of amber, liquefied copal, and other\\nresinous compounds that made colours dry quickly, and prevented\\nthem from cracking. But he experienced some terrible worries, as\\nthe absorbent nature of the canvas at once sucked in the little oil\\ncontained in the paint. Then the question of brushes had always worried\\nhim greatly; he insisted on having them with special handles; and\\nobjecting to sable, he used nothing but oven-dried badger hair.\\nMore important, however, than everything else was the question of\\npalette-knives, which, like Courbet, he used for his backgrounds. He\\nhad quite a collection of them, some long and flexible, others broad and\\nsquat, and one which was triangular like a glazierâ\\x80\\x99s, and which had been\\nexpressly made for him. It was the real Delacroix knife. Besides, he\\nnever made use of the scraper or razor, which he considered beneath an\\nartistâ\\x80\\x99s dignity. But, on the other hand, he indulged in all sorts of\\nmysterious practices in applying his colours, concocted recipes and\\nchanged them every month, and suddenly fancied that he had bit on the\\nright system of painting, when, after repudiating oil and its flow, he\\nbegan to lay on successive touches until he arrived at the exact tone\\nhe required. One of his fads for a long while was to paint from right to\\nleft; for, without confessing as much, he felt sure that it brought\\nhim luck. But the terrible affair which unhinged him once more was an\\nall-invading theory respecting the complementary colours. Gagniere had\\nbeen the first to speak to him on the subject, being himself equally\\ninclined to technical speculation. After which Claude, impelled by\\nthe exuberance of his passion, took to exaggerating the scientific\\nprinciples whereby, from the three primitive colours, yellow, red, and\\nblue, one derives the three secondary ones, orange, green, and violet,\\nand, further, a whole series of complementary and similar hues, whose\\ncomposites are obtained mathematically from one another. Thus science\\nentered into painting, there was a method for logical observation\\nalready. One only had to take the predominating hue of a picture, and\\nnote the complementary or similar colours, to establish experimentally\\nwhat variations would occur; for instance, red would turn yellowish if\\nit were near blue, and a whole landscape would change in tint by the\\nrefractions and the very decomposition of light, according to the clouds\\npassing over it. Claude then accurately came to this conclusion:\\nThat objects have no real fixed colour; that they assume various hues\\naccording to ambient circumstances; but the misfortune was that when\\nhe took to direct observation, with his brain throbbing with scientific\\nformulas, his prejudiced vision lent too much force to delicate shades,\\nand made him render what was theoretically correct in too vivid a\\nmanner: thus his style, once so bright, so full of the palpitation\\nof sunlight, ended in a reversal of everything to which the eye\\nwas accustomed, giving, for instance, flesh of a violet tinge under\\ntricoloured skies. Insanity seemed to be at the end of it all.\\n\\nPoverty finished off Claude. It had gradually increased, while the\\nfamily spent money without counting; and, when the last copper of the\\ntwenty thousand francs had gone, it swooped down upon them--horrible and\\nirreparable. Christine, who wanted to look for work, was incapable of\\ndoing anything, even ordinary needlework. She bewailed her lot, twirling\\nher fingers and inveighing against the idiotic young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s education\\nthat she had received, since it had given her no profession, and her\\nonly resource would be to enter into domestic service, should life still\\ngo against them. Claude, on his side, had become a subject of chaff with\\nthe Parisians, and no longer sold a picture. An independent exhibition\\nat which he and some friends had shown some pictures, had finished him\\noff as regards amateurs--so merry had the public become at the sight of\\nhis canvases, streaked with all the colours of the rainbow. The dealers\\nfled from him. M. Hue alone now and then made a pilgrimage to the Rue\\nTourlaque, and remained in ecstasy before the exaggerated bits, those\\nwhich blazed in unexpected pyrotechnical fashion, in despair at being\\nunable to cover them with gold. And though the painter wanted to make\\nhim a present of them, implored him to accept them, the old fellow\\ndisplayed extraordinary delicacy of feeling. He pinched himself to amass\\na small sum of money from time to time, and then religiously took away\\nthe seemingly delirious picture, to hang it beside his masterpieces.\\nSuch windfalls came too seldom, and Claude was obliged to descend to\\nâ\\x80\\x98trade art,â\\x80\\x99 repugnant as it was to him. Such, indeed, was his despair\\nat having fallen into that poison house, where he had sworn never to set\\nfoot, that he would have preferred starving to death, but for the two\\npoor beings who were dependent on him and who suffered like himself. He\\nbecame familiar with â\\x80\\x98viae dolorosaeâ\\x80\\x99 painted at reduced prices, with\\nmale and female saints at so much per gross, even with â\\x80\\x98pouncedâ\\x80\\x99 shop\\nblinds--in short, all the ignoble jobs that degrade painting and make it\\nso much idiotic delineation, lacking even the charm of naivete. He even\\nsuffered the humiliation of having portraits at five-and-twenty francs\\na-piece refused, because he failed to produce a likeness; and he reached\\nthe lowest degree of distress--he worked according to size for the petty\\ndealers who sell daubs on the bridges, and export them to semi-civilised\\ncountries. They bought his pictures at two and three francs a-piece,\\naccording to the regulation dimensions. This was like physical decay, it\\nmade him waste away; he rose from such tasks feeling ill, incapable of\\nserious work, looking at his large picture in distress, and leaving it\\nsometimes untouched for a week, as if he had felt his hands befouled and\\nunworthy of working at it.\\n\\nThey scarcely had bread to eat, and the huge shanty, which Christine had\\nshown herself so proud of, on settling in it, became uninhabitable in\\nthe winter. She, once such an active housewife, now dragged herself\\nabout the place, without courage even to sweep the floor, and thus\\neverything lapsed into abandonment. In the disaster little Jacques was\\nsadly weakened by unwholesome and insufficient food, for their meals\\noften consisted of a mere crust, eaten standing. With their lives thus\\nill-regulated, uncared for, they were drifting to the filth of the poor\\nwho lose even all self-pride.\\n\\nAt the close of another year, Claude, on one of those days of defeat,\\nwhen he fled from his miscarried picture, met an old acquaintance. This\\ntime he had sworn he would never go home again, and he had been tramping\\nacross Paris since noon, as if at his heels he had heard the wan spectre\\nof the big, nude figure of his picture--ravaged by constant retouching,\\nand always left incomplete--pursuing him with a passionate craving for\\nbirth. The mist was melting into a yellowish drizzle, befouling the\\nmuddy streets. It was about five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and he was crossing the Rue\\nRoyale like one walking in his sleep, at the risk of being run over,\\nhis clothes in rags and mud-bespattered up to his neck, when a brougham\\nsuddenly drew up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Claude, eh? Claude!--is that how you pass your friends?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was Irma Becot who spoke, Irma in a charming grey silk dress, covered\\nwith Chantilly lace. She had hastily let down the window, and she sat\\nsmiling, beaming in the frame-work of the carriage door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Where are you going?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe, staring at her open-mouthed, replied that he was going nowhere. At\\nwhich she merrily expressed surprise in a loud voice, looking at him\\nwith her saucy eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Get in, then; itâ\\x80\\x99s such a long while since we met,â\\x80\\x99 said she. â\\x80\\x98Get in,\\nor youâ\\x80\\x99ll be knocked down.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd, in fact, the other drivers were getting impatient, and urging their\\nhorses on, amidst a terrible din, so he did as he was bidden, feeling\\nquite dazed; and she drove him away, dripping, with the unmistakable\\nsigns of his poverty upon him, in the brougham lined with blue satin,\\nwhere he sat partly on the lace of her skirt, while the cabdrivers\\njeered at the elopement before falling into line again.\\n\\nWhen Claude came back to the Rue Tourlaque he was in a dazed condition,\\nand for a couple of days remained musing whether after all he might not\\nhave taken the wrong course in life. He seemed so strange that Christine\\nquestioned him, whereupon he at first stuttered and stammered, and\\nfinally confessed everything. There was a scene; she wept for a long\\nwhile, then pardoned him once more, full of infinite indulgence for him.\\nAnd, indeed, amidst all her bitter grief there sprang up a hope that he\\nmight yet return to her, for if he could deceive her thus he could not\\ncare as much as she had imagined for that hateful painted creature who\\nstared down from the big canvas.\\n\\nThe days went by, and towards the middle of the winter Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s courage\\nrevived once more. One day, while putting some old frames in order, he\\ncame upon a roll of canvas which had fallen behind the other pictures.\\nOn opening the roll he found on it the nude figure, the reclining woman\\nof his old painting, â\\x80\\x98In the Open Air,â\\x80\\x99 which he had cut out when the\\npicture had come back to him from the Salon of the Rejected. And, as he\\ngazed at it, he uttered a cry of admiration:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98By the gods, how beautiful it is!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe at once secured it to the wall with four nails, and remained for\\nhours in contemplation before it. His hands shook, the blood rushed to\\nhis face. Was it possible that he had painted such a masterly thing?\\nHe had possessed genius in those days then. So his skull, his eyes, his\\nfingers had been changed. He became so feverishly excited and felt such\\na need of unburthening himself to somebody, that at last he called his\\nwife.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just come and have a look. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t her attitude good, eh? How delicately\\nher muscles are articulated! Just look at that bit there, full of\\nsunlight. And at the shoulder here. Ah, heavens! itâ\\x80\\x99s full of life; I\\ncan feel it throb as I touch it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine, standing by, kept looking and answering in monosyllables.\\nThis resurrection of herself, after so many years, had at first\\nflattered and surprised her. But on seeing him become so excited, she\\ngradually felt uncomfortable and irritated, without knowing why.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Tell me,â\\x80\\x99 he continued, â\\x80\\x98donâ\\x80\\x99t you think her beautiful enough for one\\nto go on oneâ\\x80\\x99s knees to her?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes. But she has become rather blackish--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude protested vehemently. Become blackish, what an idea! That woman\\nwould never grow black; she possessed immortal youth! Veritable passion\\nhad seized hold of him; he spoke of the figure as of a living being; he\\nhad sudden longings to look at her that made him leave everything else,\\nas if he were hurrying to an appointment.\\n\\nThen, one morning, he was taken with a fit of work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, confound it all, as I did that, I can surely do it again,â\\x80\\x99 he\\nsaid. â\\x80\\x98Ah, this time, unless Iâ\\x80\\x99m a downright brute, weâ\\x80\\x99ll see about it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd Christine had to give him a sitting there and then. For eight hours\\na day, indeed, during a whole month he kept her before him, without\\ncompassion for her increasing exhaustion or for the fatigue he felt\\nhimself. He obstinately insisted upon producing a masterpiece; he was\\ndetermined that the upright figure of his big picture should equal that\\nreclining one which he saw on the wall, beaming with life. He constantly\\nreferred to it, compared it with the one he was painting, distracted by\\nthe fear of being unable to equal it. He cast one glance at it, another\\nat Christine, and a third at his canvas, and burst into oaths whenever\\nhe felt dissatisfied. He ended by abusing his wife.\\n\\nShe was no longer young. Age had spoilt her figure, and that it was\\nwhich spoilt his work. She listened, and staggered in her very grief.\\nThose sittings, from which she had already suffered so much, were\\nbecoming unbearable torture now. What was this new freak of crushing\\nher with her own girlhood, of fanning her jealousy by filling her with\\nregret for vanished beauty? She was becoming her own rival, she could\\nno longer look at that old picture of herself without being stung at the\\nheart by hateful envy. Ah, how heavily had that picture, that study\\nshe had sat for long ago, weighed upon her existence! The whole of her\\nmisfortunes sprang from it. It had changed the current of her existence.\\nAnd it had come to life again, it rose from the dead, endowed with\\ngreater vitality than herself, to finish killing her, for there was no\\nlonger aught but one woman for Claude--she who was shown reclining on\\nthe old canvas, and who now arose and became the upright figure of his\\nnew picture.\\n\\nThen Christine felt herself growing older and older at each successive\\nsitting. And she experienced the infinite despair which comes upon\\npassionate women when love, like beauty, abandons them. Was it because\\nof this that Claude no longer cared for her, that he sought refuge in\\nan unnatural passion for his work? She soon lost all clear perception\\nof things; she fell into a state of utter neglect, going about in a\\ndressing jacket and dirty petticoats, devoid of all coquettish feeling,\\ndiscouraged by the idea that it was useless for her to continue\\nstruggling, since she had become old.\\n\\nThere were occasionally abominable scenes between her and Claude, who\\nthis time, however, obstinately stuck to his work and finished his\\npicture, swearing that, come what might, he would send it to the Salon.\\nHe lived on his steps, cleaning up his backgrounds until dark. At last,\\nthoroughly exhausted, he declared that he would touch the canvas no\\nmore; and Sandoz, on coming to see him one day, at four oâ\\x80\\x99clock, did not\\nfind him at home. Christine declared that he had just gone out to take a\\nbreath of air on the height of Montmartre.\\n\\nThe breach between Claude and his old friends had gradually widened.\\nWith time the lattersâ\\x80\\x99 visits had become brief and far between, for they\\nfelt uncomfortable when they found themselves face to face with that\\ndisturbing style of painting; and they were more and more upset by the\\nunhinging of a mind which had been the admiration of their youth. Now\\nall had fled; none excepting Sandoz ever came. Gagniere had even left\\nParis, to settle down in one of the two houses he owned at Melun, where\\nhe lived frugally upon the proceeds of the other one, after suddenly\\nmarrying, to every oneâ\\x80\\x99s surprise, an old maid, his music mistress, who\\nplayed Wagner to him of an evening. As for Mahoudeau, he alleged work\\nas an excuse for not coming, and indeed he was beginning to earn some\\nmoney, thanks to a bronze manufacturer, who employed him to touch up\\nhis models. Matters were different with Jory, whom no one saw, since\\nMathilde despotically kept him sequestrated. She had conquered him,\\nand he had fallen into a kind of domesticity comparable to that of a\\nfaithful dog, yielding up the keys of his cashbox, and only carrying\\nenough money about him to buy a cigar at a time. It was even said that\\nMathilde, like the devotee she had once been, had thrown him into the\\narms of the Church, in order to consolidate her conquest, and that she\\nwas constantly talking to him about death, of which he was horribly\\nafraid. Fagerolles alone affected a lively, cordial feeling towards\\nhis old friend Claude whenever he happened to meet him. He then always\\npromised to go and see him, but never did so. He was so busy since his\\ngreat success, in such request, advertised, celebrated, on the road to\\nevery imaginable honour and form of fortune! And Claude regretted\\nnobody save Dubuche, to whom he still felt attached, from a feeling\\nof affection for the old reminiscences of boyhood, notwithstanding the\\ndisagreements which difference of disposition had provoked later on. But\\nDubuche, it appeared, was not very happy either. No doubt he was gorged\\nwith millions, but he led a wretched life, constantly at logger-heads\\nwith his father-in-law (who complained of having been deceived with\\nregard to his capabilities as an architect), and obliged to pass\\nhis life amidst the medicine bottles of his ailing wife and his two\\nchildren, who, having been prematurely born, had to be reared virtually\\nin cotton wool.\\n\\nOf all the old friends, therefore, there only remained Sandoz, who still\\nfound his way to the Rue Tourlaque. He came thither for little Jacques,\\nhis godson, and for the sorrowing woman also, that Christine whose\\npassionate features amidst all this distress moved him deeply, like a\\nvision of one of the ardently amorous creatures whom he would have\\nliked to embody in his books. But, above all, his feeling of artistic\\nbrotherliness had increased since he had seen Claude losing ground,\\nfoundering amidst the heroic folly of art. At first he had remained\\nutterly astonished at it, for he had believed in his friend more than in\\nhimself. Since their college days, he had always placed himself second,\\nwhile setting Claude very high on fameâ\\x80\\x99s ladder--on the same rung,\\nindeed, as the masters who revolutionise a period. Then he had been\\ngrievously affected by that bankruptcy of genius; he had become full\\nof bitter, heartfelt pity at the sight of the horrible torture of\\nimpotency. Did one ever know who was the madman in art? Every failure\\ntouched him to the quick, and the more a picture or a book verged upon\\naberration, sank to the grotesque and lamentable, the more did Sandoz\\nquiver with compassion, the more did he long to lull to sleep, in the\\nsoothing extravagance of their dreams, those who were thus blasted by\\ntheir own work.\\n\\nOn the day when Sandoz called, and failed to find Claude at home, he did\\nnot go away; but, seeing Christineâ\\x80\\x99s eyelids red with crying, he said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you think that heâ\\x80\\x99ll be in soon, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wait for him.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! he surely wonâ\\x80\\x99t be long.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98In that case Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wait, unless I am in your way.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNever had her demeanour, the crushed look of a neglected woman, her\\nlistless movements, her slow speech, her indifference for everything but\\nthe passion that was consuming her, moved him so deeply. For the last\\nweek, perhaps, she had not put a chair in its place, or dusted a piece\\nof furniture; she left the place to go to wreck and ruin, scarcely\\nhaving the strength to drag herself about. And it was enough to break\\noneâ\\x80\\x99s heart to behold that misery ending in filth beneath the glaring\\nlight from the big window; to gaze on that ill-pargetted shanty, so bare\\nand disorderly, where one shivered with melancholy although it was a\\nbright February afternoon.\\n\\nChristine had slowly sat down beside an iron bedstead, which Sandoz had\\nnot noticed when he came in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98is Jacques ill?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was covering up the child, who constantly flung off the bedclothes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, he hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been up these three days. We brought his bed in here so\\nthat he might be with us. He was never very strong. But he is getting\\nworse and worse, itâ\\x80\\x99s distracting.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had a fixed stare in her eyes and spoke in a monotonous tone, and\\nSandoz felt frightened when he drew up to the bedside. The childâ\\x80\\x99s pale\\nhead seemed to have grown bigger still, so heavy that he could no longer\\nsupport it. He lay perfectly still, and one might have thought he was\\ndead, but for the heavy breathing coming from between his discoloured\\nlips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My poor little Jacques, itâ\\x80\\x99s I, your godfather. Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you say how dâ\\x80\\x99ye\\ndo?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe child made a fruitless, painful effort to lift his head; his eyelids\\nparted, showing his white eyeballs, then closed again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Have you sent for a doctor?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine shrugged her shoulders.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! doctors, what do they know?â\\x80\\x99 she answered. â\\x80\\x98We sent for one; he\\nsaid that there was nothing to be done. Let us hope that it will pass\\nover again. He is close upon twelve years old now, and maybe he is\\ngrowing too fast.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz, quite chilled, said nothing for fear of increasing her anxiety,\\nsince she did not seem to realise the gravity of the disease. He walked\\nabout in silence and stopped in front of the picture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ho, ho! itâ\\x80\\x99s getting on; itâ\\x80\\x99s on the right road this time.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s finished.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! finished?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd when she told him that the canvas was to be sent to the Salon that\\nnext week, he looked embarrassed, and sat down on the couch, like a man\\nwho wishes to judge the work leisurely. The background, the quays, the\\nSeine, whence arose the triumphal point of the Cite, still remained in a\\nsketchy state--masterly, however, but as if the painter had been afraid\\nof spoiling the Paris of his dream by giving it greater finish. There\\nwas also an excellent group on the left, the lightermen unloading the\\nsacks of plaster being carefully and powerfully treated. But the boat\\nfull of women in the centre transpierced the picture, as it were, with\\na blaze of flesh-tints which were quite out of place; and the brilliancy\\nand hallucinatory proportions of the large nude figure which Claude had\\npainted in a fever seemed strangely, disconcertingly false amidst the\\nreality of all the rest.\\n\\nSandoz, silent, fell despair steal over him as he sat in front of that\\nmagnificent failure. But he saw Christineâ\\x80\\x99s eyes fixed upon him, and had\\nsufficient strength of mind to say:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Astounding!--the woman, astounding!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt that moment Claude came in, and on seeing his old chum he uttered\\na joyous exclamation and shook his hand vigorously. Then he approached\\nChristine, and kissed little Jacques, who had once more thrown off the\\nbedclothes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98How is he?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just the same.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98To be sure, to be sure; he is growing too fast. A few daysâ\\x80\\x99 rest will\\nset him all right. I told you not to be uneasy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd Claude thereupon sat down beside Sandoz on the couch. They both took\\ntheir ease, leaning back, with their eyes surveying the picture; while\\nChristine, seated by the bed, looked at nothing, and seemingly thought\\nof nothing, in the everlasting desolation of her heart. Night was slowly\\ncoming on, the vivid light from the window paled already, losing its\\nsheen amidst the slowly-falling crepuscular dimness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98So itâ\\x80\\x99s settled; your wife told me that you were going to send it in.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are right; you had better have done with it once for all. Oh, there\\nare some magnificent bits in it. The quay in perspective to the left,\\nthe man who shoulders that sack below. But--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe hesitated, then finally took the bull by the horns.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, itâ\\x80\\x99s odd that you have persisted in leaving those women nude. It\\nisnâ\\x80\\x99t logical, I assure you; and, besides, you promised me you would\\ndress them--donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember? You have set your heart upon them very\\nmuch then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude answered curtly, with the obstinacy of one mastered by a fixed\\nidea and unwilling to give any explanations. Then he crossed his arms\\nbehind his head, and began talking of other things, without, however,\\ntaking his eyes off his picture, over which the twilight began to cast a\\nslight shadow.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do you know where I have just come from?â\\x80\\x99 he asked. â\\x80\\x98I have been to\\nCourajodâ\\x80\\x99s. You know, the great landscape painter, whose â\\x80\\x9cPond of Gagnyâ\\x80\\x9d\\n is at the Luxembourg. You remember, I thought he was dead, and we were\\ntold that he lived hereabouts, on the other side of the hill, in the Rue\\nde lâ\\x80\\x99Abreuvoir. Well, old boy, he worried me, did Courajod. While taking\\na breath of air now and then up there, I discovered his shanty, and I\\ncould no longer pass in front of it without wanting to go inside. Just\\nthink, a master, a man who invented our modern landscape school, and who\\nlives there, unknown, done for, like a mole in its hole! You can have no\\nidea of the street or the caboose: a village street, full of fowls, and\\nbordered by grassy banks; and a caboose like a childâ\\x80\\x99s toy, with tiny\\nwindows, a tiny door, a tiny garden. Oh! the garden--a mere patch of\\nsoil, sloping down abruptly, with a bed where four pear trees stand,\\nand the rest taken up by a fowl-house, made out of green boards, old\\nplaster, and wire network, held together with bits of string.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis words came slowly; he blinked while he spoke as if the thought of\\nhis picture had returned to him and was gradually taking possession\\nof him, to such a degree as to hamper him in his speech about other\\nmatters.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, as luck would have it, I found Courajod on his doorstep to-day.\\nAn old man of more than eighty, wrinkled and shrunk to the size of a\\nboy. I should like you to see him, with his clogs, his peasantâ\\x80\\x99s jersey\\nand his coloured handkerchief wound over his head as if he were an old\\nmarket-woman. I pluckily went up to him, saying, â\\x80\\x9cMonsieur Courajod, I\\nknow you very well; you have a picture in the Luxembourg Gallery which\\nis a masterpiece. Allow a painter to shake hands with you as he would\\nwith his master.â\\x80\\x9d And then you should have seen him take fright, draw\\nback and stutter, as if I were going to strike him. A regular flight!\\nHowever, I followed him, and gradually he recovered his composure, and\\nshowed me his hens, his ducks, his rabbits and dogs--an extraordinary\\ncollection of birds and beasts; there was even a raven among them. He\\nlives in the midst of them all; he speaks to no one but his animals.\\nAs for the view, itâ\\x80\\x99s simply magnificent; you see the whole of the\\nSt. Denis plain for miles upon miles; rivers and towns, smoking\\nfactory-chimneys, and puffing railway-engines; in short, the place is\\na real hermitage on a hill, with its back turned to Paris and its eyes\\nfixed on the boundless country. As a matter of course, I came back to\\nhis picture. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Monsieur Courajod,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cwhat talent you showed!\\nIf you only knew how much we all admire you. You are one of our\\nillustrious men; youâ\\x80\\x99ll remain the ancestor of us all.â\\x80\\x9d But his lips\\nbegan to tremble again; he looked at me with an air of terror-stricken\\nstupidity; I am sure he would not have waved me back with a more\\nimploring gesture if I had unearthed under his very eyes the corpse of\\nsome forgotten comrade of his youth. He kept chewing disconnected words\\nbetween his toothless gums; it was the mumbling of an old man who had\\nsunk into second childhood, and whom itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to understand.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t know--so long ago--too old--donâ\\x80\\x99t care a rap.â\\x80\\x9d To make a long\\nstory short, he showed me the door; I heard him hurriedly turn the\\nkey in lock, barricading himself and his birds and animals against the\\nadmiration of the outside world. Ah, my good fellow, the idea of it!\\nThat great man ending his life like a retired grocer; that voluntary\\nrelapse into â\\x80\\x9cnothingnessâ\\x80\\x9d even before death. Ah, the glory, the glory\\nfor which we others are ready to die!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaudeâ\\x80\\x99s voice, which had sunk lower and lower, died away at last in\\na melancholy sigh. Darkness was still coming on; after gradually\\ncollecting in the corners, it rose like a slow, inexorable tide, first\\nsubmerging the legs of the chairs and the table, all the confusion of\\nthings that littered the tiled floor. The lower part of the picture was\\nalready growing dim, and Claude, with his eyes still desperately fixed\\non it, seemed to be watching the ascent of the darkness as if he had at\\nlast judged his work in the expiring light. And no sound was heard save\\nthe stertorous breathing of the sick child, near whom there still loomed\\nthe dark silhouette of the motionless mother.\\n\\nThen Sandoz spoke in his turn, his hands also crossed behind his head,\\nand his back resting against one of the cushions of the couch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Does one ever know? Would it not be better, perhaps, to live and die\\nunknown? What a sell it would be if artistic glory existed no more than\\nthe Paradise which is talked about in catechisms and which even children\\nnowadays make fun of! We, who no longer believe in the Divinity, still\\nbelieve in our own immortality. What a farce it all is!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, affected to melancholy himself by the mournfulness of the\\ntwilight, and stirred by all the human suffering he beheld around him,\\nhe began to speak of his own torments.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Look here, old man, I, whom you envy, perhaps--yes, I, who am beginning\\nto get on in the world, as middle-class people say--I, who publish books\\nand earn a little money--well, I am being killed by it all. I have often\\nalready told you this, but you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe me, because, as you only\\nturn out work with a deal of trouble and cannot bring yourself to public\\nnotice, happiness in your eyes could naturally consist in producing a\\ngreat deal, in being seen, and praised or slated. Well, get admitted to\\nthe next Salon, get into the thick of the battle, paint other pictures,\\nand then tell me whether that suffices, and whether you are happy at\\nlast. Listen; work has taken up the whole of my existence. Little by\\nlittle, it has robbed me of my mother, of my wife, of everything I love.\\nIt is like a germ thrown into the cranium, which feeds on the brain,\\nfinds its way into the trunk and limbs, and gnaws up the whole of the\\nbody. The moment I jump out of bed of a morning, work clutches hold\\nof me, rivets me to my desk without leaving me time to get a breath of\\nfresh air; then it pursues me at luncheon--I audibly chew my sentences\\nwith my bread. Next it accompanies me when I go out, comes back with me\\nand dines off the same plate as myself; lies down with me on my pillow,\\nso utterly pitiless that I am never able to set the book in hand on one\\nside; indeed, its growth continues even in the depth of my sleep. And\\nnothing outside of it exists for me. True, I go upstairs to embrace my\\nmother, but in so absent-minded a way, that ten minutes after leaving\\nher I ask myself whether I have really been to wish her good-morning. My\\npoor wife has no husband; I am not with her even when our hands touch.\\nSometimes I have an acute feeling that I am making their lives very\\nsad, and I feel very remorseful, for happiness is solely composed of\\nkindness, frankness and gaiety in oneâ\\x80\\x99s home; but how can I escape from\\nthe claws of the monster? I at once relapse into the somnambulism of my\\nworking hours, into the indifference and moroseness of my fixed idea.\\nIf the pages I have written during the morning have been worked off all\\nright, so much the better; if one of them has remained in distress, so\\nmuch the worse. The household will laugh or cry according to the whim of\\nthat all-devouring monster--Work. No, no! I have nothing that I can call\\nmy own. In my days of poverty I dreamt of rest in the country, of travel\\nin distant lands; and now that I might make those dreams reality, the\\nwork that has been begun keeps me shut up. There is no chance of a walk\\nin the morningâ\\x80\\x99s sun, no chance of running round to a friendâ\\x80\\x99s house, or\\nof a mad bout of idleness! My strength of will has gone with the rest;\\nall this has become a habit; I have locked the door of the world behind\\nme, and thrown the key out of the window. There is no longer anything in\\nmy den but work and myself--and work will devour me, and then there will\\nbe nothing left, nothing at all!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe paused, and silence reigned once more in the deepening gloom. Then he\\nbegan again with an effort:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And if one were only satisfied, if one only got some enjoyment out of\\nsuch a niggerâ\\x80\\x99s life! Ah! I should like to know how those fellows manage\\nwho smoke cigarettes and complacently stroke their beards while they are\\nat work. Yes, it appears to me that there are some who find production\\nan easy pleasure, to be set aside or taken up without the least\\nexcitement. They are delighted, they admire themselves, they\\ncannot write a couple of lines but they find those lines of a rare,\\ndistinguished, matchless quality. Well, as for myself, I bring forth\\nin anguish, and my offspring seems a horror to me. How can a man\\nbe sufficiently wanting in self-doubt as to believe in himself? It\\nabsolutely amazes me to see men, who furiously deny talent to everybody\\nelse, lose all critical acumen, all common-sense, when it becomes a\\nquestion of their own bastard creations. Why, a book is always very\\nugly. To like it one mustnâ\\x80\\x99t have had a hand in the cooking of it. I say\\nnothing of the jugsful of insults that are showered upon one. Instead of\\nannoying, they rather encourage me. I see men who are upset by attacks,\\nwho feel a humiliating craving to win sympathy. It is a simple question\\nof temperament; some women would die if they failed to please. But, to\\nmy thinking, insult is a very good medicine to take; unpopularity is a\\nvery manly school to be brought up in. Nothing keeps one in such good\\nhealth and strength as the hooting of a crowd of imbeciles. It suffices\\nthat a man can say that he has given his lifeâ\\x80\\x99s blood to his work; that\\nhe expects neither immediate justice nor serious attention; that he\\nworks without hope of any kind, and simply because the love of work\\nbeats beneath his skin like his heart, irrespective of any will of his\\nown. If he can do all this, he may die in the effort with the consoling\\nillusion that he will be appreciated one day or other. Ah! if the others\\nonly knew how jauntily I bear the weight of their anger. Only there\\nis my own choler, which overwhelms me; I fret that I cannot live for a\\nmoment happy. What hours of misery I spend, great heavens! from the\\nvery day I begin a novel. During the first chapters there isnâ\\x80\\x99t so much\\ntrouble. I have plenty of room before me in which to display genius. But\\nafterwards I become distracted, and am never satisfied with the daily\\ntask; I condemn the book before it is finished, judging it inferior\\nto its elders; and I torture myself about certain pages, about certain\\nsentences, certain words, so that at last the very commas assume an\\nugly look, from which I suffer. And when it is finished--ah! when it is\\nfinished, what a relief! Not the enjoyment of the gentleman who exalts\\nhimself in the worship of his offspring, but the curse of the labourer\\nwho throws down the burden that has been breaking his back. Then,\\nlater on, with another book, it all begins afresh; it will always begin\\nafresh, and I shall die under it, furious with myself, exasperated\\nat not having had more talent, enraged at not leaving a â\\x80\\x9cworkâ\\x80\\x9d more\\ncomplete, of greater dimensions--books upon books, a pile of mountain\\nheight! And at my death I shall feel horrible doubts about the task I\\nmay have accomplished, asking myself whether I ought not to have gone to\\nthe left when I went to the right, and my last word, my last gasp, will\\nbe to recommence the whole over again--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was thoroughly moved; the words stuck in his throat; he was obliged\\nto draw breath for a moment before delivering himself of this passionate\\ncry in which all his impenitent lyricism took wing:\\n\\nAh, life! a second span of life, who shall give it to me, that work may\\nrob me of it again--that I may die of it once more?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt had now become quite dark; the motherâ\\x80\\x99s rigid silhouette was no\\nlonger visible; the hoarse breathing of the child sounded amidst the\\nobscurity like a terrible and distant signal of distress, uprising from\\nthe streets. In the whole studio, which had become lugubriously black,\\nthe big canvas only showed a glimpse of pallidity, a last vestige of the\\nwaning daylight. The nude figure, similar to an agonising vision, seemed\\nto be floating about, without definite shape, the legs having already\\nvanished, one arm being already submerged, and the only part at all\\ndistinct being the trunk, which shone like a silvery moon.\\n\\nAfter a protracted pause, Sandoz inquired:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Shall I go with you when you take your picture?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGetting no answer from Claude, he fancied he could hear him crying. Was\\nit with the same infinite sadness, the despair by which he himself\\nhad been stirred just now? He waited for a moment, then repeated his\\nquestion, and at last the painter, after choking down a sob, stammered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thanks, the picture will remain here; I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t send it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What? Why, you had made up your mind?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes, I had made up my mind; but I had not seen it as I saw it\\njust now in the waning daylight. I have failed with it, failed with it\\nagain--it struck my eyes like a blow, it went to my very heart.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis tears now flowed slow and scalding in the gloom that hid him from\\nsight. He had been restraining himself, and now the silent anguish which\\nhad consumed him burst forth despite all his efforts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98My poor friend,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, quite upset; â\\x80\\x98it is hard to tell you so,\\nbut all the same you are right, perhaps, in delaying matters to finish\\ncertain parts rather more. Still I am angry with myself, for I shall\\nimagine that it was I who discouraged you by my everlasting stupid\\ndiscontent with things.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude simply answered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You! what an idea! I was not even listening to you. No; I was looking,\\nand I saw everything go helter-skelter in that confounded canvas. The\\nlight was dying away, and all at once, in the greyish dusk, the scales\\nsuddenly dropped from my eyes. The background alone is pretty; the\\nnude woman is altogether too loud; whatâ\\x80\\x99s more, sheâ\\x80\\x99s out of the\\nperpendicular, and her legs are badly drawn. When I noticed that, ah!\\nit was enough to kill me there and then; I felt life departing from me.\\nThen the gloom kept rising and rising, bringing a whirling sensation, a\\nfoundering of everything, the earth rolling into chaos, the end of the\\nworld. And soon I only saw the trunk waning like a sickly moon. And\\nlook, look! there now remains nothing of her, not a glimpse; she is\\ndead, quite black!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, the picture had at last entirely disappeared. But the painter\\nhad risen and could be heard swearing in the dense obscurity.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98D--n it all, it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll set to work at it again--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Christine, who had also risen from her chair, against which he\\nstumbled, interrupted him, saying: â\\x80\\x98Take care, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll light the lamp.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe lighted it and came back looking very pale, casting a glance of\\nhatred and fear at the picture. It was not to go then? The abomination\\nwas to begin once more!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll set to work at it again,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Claude, â\\x80\\x98and it shall kill me,\\nit shall kill my wife, my child, the whole lot; but, by heaven, it shall\\nbe a masterpiece!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine sat down again; they approached Jacques, who had thrown the\\nclothes off once more with his feverish little hands. He was still\\nbreathing heavily, lying quite inert, his head buried in the pillow like\\na weight, with which the bed seemed to creak. When Sandoz was on\\nthe point of going, he expressed his uneasiness. The mother appeared\\nstupefied; while the father was already returning to his picture, the\\nmasterpiece which awaited creation, and the thought of which filled him\\nwith such passionate illusions that he gave less heed to the painful\\nreality of the sufferings of his child, the true living flesh of his\\nflesh.\\n\\nOn the following morning, Claude had just finished dressing, when he\\nheard Christine calling in a frightened voice. She also had just woke\\nwith a start from the heavy sleep which had benumbed her while she sat\\nwatching the sick child.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Claude! Claude! Oh, look! He is dead.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter rushed forward, with heavy eyes, stumbling, and apparently\\nfailing to understand, for he repeated with an air of profound\\namazement, â\\x80\\x98What do you mean by saying he is dead?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor a moment they remained staring wildly at the bed. The poor little\\nfellow, with his disproportionate head--the head of the progeny of\\ngenius, exaggerated as to verge upon cretinism--did not appear to have\\nstirred since the previous night; but no breath came from his mouth,\\nwhich had widened and become discoloured, and his glassy eyes were open.\\nHis father laid his hands upon him and found him icy cold.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is true, he is dead.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd their stupor was such that for yet another moment they remained with\\ntheir eyes dry, simply thunderstruck, as it were, by the abruptness of\\nthat death which they considered incredible.\\n\\nThen, her knees bending under her, Christine dropped down in front of\\nthe bed, bursting into violent sobs which shook her from head to foot,\\nand wringing her hands, whilst her forehead remained pressed against\\nthe mattress. In that first moment of horror her despair was aggravated\\nabove all by poignant remorse--the remorse of not having sufficiently\\ncared for the poor child. Former days started up before her in a rapid\\nvision, each bringing with it regretfulness for unkind words, deferred\\ncaresses, rough treatment even. And now it was all over; she would never\\nbe able to compensate the lad for the affection she had withheld from\\nhim. He whom she thought so disobedient had obeyed but too well at last.\\nShe had so often told him when at play to be still, and not to disturb\\nhis father at his work, that he was quiet at last, and for ever. The\\nidea suffocated her; each sob drew from her a dull moan.\\n\\nClaude had begun walking up and down the studio, unable to remain still.\\nWith his features convulsed, he shed a few big tears, which he brushed\\naway with the back of his hand. And whenever he passed in front of the\\nlittle corpse he could not help glancing at it. The glassy eyes, wide\\nopen, seemed to exercise a spell over him. At first he resisted, but a\\nconfused idea assumed shape within him, and would not be shaken off. He\\nyielded to it at last, took a small canvas, and began to paint a study\\nof the dead child. For the first few minutes his tears dimmed his\\nsight, wrapping everything in a mist; but he kept wiping them away, and\\npersevered with his work, even though his brush shook. Then the passion\\nfor art dried his tears and steadied his hand, and in a little while it\\nwas no longer his icy son that lay there, but merely a model, a subject,\\nthe strange interest of which stirred him. That huge head, that waxy\\nflesh, those eyes which looked like holes staring into space--all\\nexcited and thrilled him. He stepped back, seemed to take pleasure in\\nhis work, and vaguely smiled at it.\\n\\nWhen Christine rose from her knees, she found him thus occupied. Then,\\nbursting into tears again, she merely said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! you can paint him now, heâ\\x80\\x99ll never stir again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor five hours Claude kept at it, and on the second day, when Sandoz\\ncame back with him from the cemetery, after the funeral, he shuddered\\nwith pity and admiration at the sight of the small canvas. It was one of\\nthe fine bits of former days, a masterpiece of limpidity and power,\\nto which was added a note of boundless melancholy, the end of\\neverything--all life ebbing away with the death of that child.\\n\\nBut Sandoz, who had burst out into exclamations fall of praise, was\\nquite taken aback on hearing Claude say to him:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are sure you like it? In that case, as the other machine isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nready, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll send this to the Salon.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\nONE morning, as Claude, who had taken â\\x80\\x98The Dead Childâ\\x80\\x99 to the Palais de\\nlâ\\x80\\x99Industrie the previous day, was roaming round about the Parc Monceau,\\nhe suddenly came upon Fagerolles.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What!â\\x80\\x99 said the latter, cordially, â\\x80\\x98is it you, old fellow? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbecoming of you? What are you doing? We see so little of each other\\nnow.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, Claude having mentioned what he had sent to the Salon--that little\\ncanvas which his mind was full of--Fagerolles added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! youâ\\x80\\x99ve sent something; then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get it â\\x80\\x9chungâ\\x80\\x9d for you. You know\\nthat Iâ\\x80\\x99m a candidate for the hanging committee this year.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIndeed, amid the tumult and everlasting discontent of the artists, after\\nattempts at reform, repeated a score of times and then abandoned, the\\nauthorities had just invested the exhibitors with the privilege of\\nelecting the members of the hanging committee; and this had quite upset\\nthe world of painters and sculptors, a perfect electoral fever had\\nset in, with all sorts of ambitious cabals and intrigues--all the low\\njobbery, indeed, by which politics are dishonoured.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to take you with me,â\\x80\\x99 continued Fagerolles; you must come\\nand see how Iâ\\x80\\x99m settled in my little house, in which you havenâ\\x80\\x99t yet set\\nfoot, in spite of all your promises. Itâ\\x80\\x99s there, hard by, at the corner\\nof the Avenue de Villiers.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, whose arm he had gaily taken, was obliged to follow him. He was\\nseized with a fit of cowardice; the idea that his old chum might get\\nhis picture â\\x80\\x98hungâ\\x80\\x99 for him filled him with mingled shame and desire.\\nOn reaching the avenue, he stopped in front of the house to look at its\\nfrontage, a bit of coquettish, _precioso_ architectural tracery--the\\nexact copy of a Renaissance house at Bourges, with lattice windows, a\\nstaircase tower, and a roof decked with leaden ornaments. It looked\\nlike the abode of a harlot; and Claude was struck with surprise when,\\non turning round, he recognised Irma Becotâ\\x80\\x99s regal mansion just over\\nthe way. Huge, substantial, almost severe of aspect, it had all the\\nimportance of a palace compared to its neighbour, the dwelling of the\\nartist, who was obliged to limit himself to a fanciful nick-nack.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! that Irma, eh?â\\x80\\x99 said Fagerolles with just a shade of respect in his\\ntone. â\\x80\\x98She has got a cathedral and no mistake! But come in.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe interior of Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 house was strangely and magnificently\\nluxurious. Old tapestry, old weapons, a heap of old furniture, Chinese\\nand Japanese curios were displayed even in the very hall. On the left\\nthere was a dining-room, panelled with lacquer work and having its\\nceiling draped with a design of a red dragon. Then there was a staircase\\nof carved wood above which banners drooped, whilst tropical plants rose\\nup like plumes. Overhead, the studio was a marvel, though rather small\\nand without a picture visible. The walls, indeed, were entirely covered\\nwith Oriental hangings, while at one end rose up a huge chimney-piece\\nwith chimerical monsters supporting the tablet, and at the other\\nextremity appeared a vast couch under a tent--the latter quite\\na monument, with lances upholding the sumptuous drapery, above a\\ncollection of carpets, furs and cushions heaped together almost on a\\nlevel with the flooring.\\n\\nClaude looked at it all, and there came to his lips a question which\\nhe held back--Was all this paid for? Fagerolles, who had been decorated\\nwith the Legion of Honour the previous year, now asked, it was said,\\nten thousand francs for painting a mere portrait. Naudet, who, after\\nlaunching him, duly turned his success to profit in a methodical\\nfashion, never let one of his pictures go for less than twenty, thirty,\\nforty thousand francs. Orders would have fallen on the painterâ\\x80\\x99s\\nshoulders as thick as hail, if he had not affected the disdain, the\\nweariness of the man whose slightest sketches are fought for. And yet\\nall this display of luxury smacked of indebtedness, there was only so\\nmuch paid on account to the upholsterers; all the money--the money won\\nby lucky strokes as on â\\x80\\x98Change--slipped through the artistâ\\x80\\x99s fingers,\\nand was spent without trace of it remaining. Moreover, Fagerolles,\\nstill in the full flush of his sudden good fortune, did not calculate or\\nworry, being confident that he would always sell his works at higher\\nand higher prices, and feeling glorious at the high position he was\\nacquiring in contemporary art.\\n\\nEventually, Claude espied a little canvas on an ebony easel, draped with\\nred plush. Excepting a rosewood tube case and box of crayons, forgotten\\non an article of furniture, nothing reminding one of the artistic\\nprofession could be seen lying about.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Very finely treated,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, wishing to be amiable, as he stood\\nin front of the little canvas. â\\x80\\x98And is your picture for the Salon sent?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! yes, thank heavens! What a number of people I had here! A perfect\\nprocession which kept me on my legs from morning till evening during a\\nweek. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to exhibit it, as it lowers one to do so, and Naudet\\nalso opposed it. But what would you have done? I was so begged and\\nprayed; all the young fellows want to set me on the committee, so that I\\nmay defend them. Oh! my picture is simple enough--I call it â\\x80\\x9cA\\nPicnic.â\\x80\\x9d There are a couple of gentlemen and three ladies under some\\ntrees--guests at some chateau, who have brought a collation with them\\nand are eating it in a glade. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see, itâ\\x80\\x99s rather original.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe spoke in a hesitating manner, and when his eyes met those of Claude,\\nwho was looking at him fixedly, he lost countenance altogether, and\\njoked about the little canvas on the easel.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a daub Naudet asked me for. Oh! Iâ\\x80\\x99m not ignorant of what I\\nlack--a little of what you have too much of, old man. You know that\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m still your friend; why, I defended you only yesterday with some\\npainters.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe tapped Claude on the shoulders, for he had divined his old\\nmasterâ\\x80\\x99s secret contempt, and wished to win him back by his old-time\\ncaresses--all the wheedling practices of a hussy. Very sincerely and\\nwith a sort of anxious deference he again promised Claude that he would\\ndo everything in his power to further the hanging of his picture, â\\x80\\x98The\\nDead Child.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, some people arrived; more than fifteen persons came in and\\nwent off in less than an hour--fathers bringing young pupils, exhibitors\\nanxious to say a good word on their own behalf, friends who wanted\\nto barter influence, even women who placed their talents under the\\nprotection of their charms. And one should have seen the painter play\\nhis part as a candidate, shaking hands most lavishly, saying to one\\nvisitor: â\\x80\\x98Your picture this year is so pretty, it pleases me so much!â\\x80\\x99\\nthen feigning astonishment with another: â\\x80\\x98What! you havenâ\\x80\\x99t had a medal\\nyet?â\\x80\\x99 and repeating to all of them: â\\x80\\x98Ah! If I belonged to the committee,\\nIâ\\x80\\x99d make them walk straight.â\\x80\\x99 He sent every one away delighted, closed\\nthe door behind each visitor with an air of extreme amiability, through\\nwhich, however, there pierced the secret sneer of an ex-lounger on the\\npavement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You see, eh?â\\x80\\x99 he said to Claude, at a moment when they happened to be\\nleft alone. â\\x80\\x98What a lot of time I lose with those idiots!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen he approached the large window, and abruptly opened one of the\\ncasements; and on one of the balconies of the house over the way a\\nwoman clad in a lace dressing-gown could be distinguished waving her\\nhandkerchief. Fagerolles on his side waved his hand three times in\\nsuccession. Then both windows were closed again.\\n\\nClaude had recognised Irma; and amid the silence which fell Fagerolles\\nquietly explained matters:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s convenient, you see, one can correspond. We have a complete system\\nof telegraphy. She wants to speak to me, so I must go--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSince he and Irma had resided in the avenue, they met, it was said,\\non their old footing. It was even asserted that he, so â\\x80\\x98cute,â\\x80\\x99 so\\nwell-acquainted with Parisian humbug, let himself be fleeced by her,\\nbled at every moment of some good round sum, which she sent her maid\\nto ask for--now to pay a tradesman, now to satisfy a whim, often for\\nnothing at all, or rather for the sole pleasure of emptying his\\npockets; and this partly explained his embarrassed circumstances, his\\nindebtedness, which ever increased despite the continuous rise in the\\nquotations of his canvases.\\n\\nClaude had put on his hat again. Fagerolles was shuffling about\\nimpatiently, looking nervously at the house over the way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t send you off, but you see sheâ\\x80\\x99s waiting for me,â\\x80\\x99 he said,\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, itâ\\x80\\x99s understood, your affairâ\\x80\\x99s settled--that is, unless Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nnot elected. Come to the Palais de lâ\\x80\\x99Industrie on the evening the\\nvoting-papers are counted. Oh! there will be a regular crush, quite a\\nrumpus! Still, you will always learn if you can rely on me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt first, Claude inwardly swore that he would not trouble about it.\\nFagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 protection weighed heavily upon him; and yet, in his heart\\nof hearts, he really had but one fear, that the shifty fellow would not\\nkeep his promise, but would ultimately be taken with a fit of cowardice\\nat the idea of protecting a defeated man. However, on the day of the\\nvote Claude could not keep still, but went and roamed about the Champs\\nElysees under the pretence of taking a long walk. He might as well go\\nthere as elsewhere, for while waiting for the Salon he had altogether\\nceased work. He himself could not vote, as to do so it was necessary to\\nhave been â\\x80\\x98hungâ\\x80\\x99 on at least one occasion. However, he repeatedly passed\\nbefore the Palais de lâ\\x80\\x99Industrie,* the foot pavement in front of which\\ninterested him with its bustling aspect, its procession of artist\\nelectors, whom men in dirty blouses caught hold of, shouting to them\\nthe titles of their lists of candidates--lists some thirty in number\\nemanating from every possible coterie, and representing every possible\\nopinion. There was the list of the studios of the School of Arts, the\\nliberal list, the list of the uncompromising radical painters, the\\nconciliatory list, the young paintersâ\\x80\\x99 list, even the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 list,\\nand so forth. The scene suggested all the turmoil at the door of an\\nelectoral polling booth on the morrow of a riot.\\n\\n  * This palace, for many years the home of the â\\x80\\x98Salon,â\\x80\\x99 was built\\n    for the first Paris International Exhibition, that of 1855,\\n    and demolished in connection with that of 1900.--ED.\\n\\nAt four oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon, when the voting was over, Claude could\\nnot resist a fit of curiosity to go and have a look. The staircase was\\nnow free, and whoever chose could enter. Upstairs, he came upon the huge\\ngallery, overlooking the Champs Elysees, which was set aside for the\\nhanging committee. A table, forty feet long, filled the centre of this\\ngallery, and entire trees were burning in the monumental fireplace at\\none end of it. Some four or five hundred electors, who had remained to\\nsee the votes counted, stood there, mingled with friends and inquisitive\\nstrangers, talking, laughing, and setting quite a storm loose under the\\nlofty ceiling. Around the table, parties of people who had volunteered\\nto count the votes were already settled and at work; there were some\\nfifteen of these parties in all, each comprising a chairman and two\\nscrutineers. Three or four more remained to be organised, and nobody\\nelse offered assistance; in fact, every one turned away in fear of the\\ncrushing labour which would rivet the more zealous people to the spot\\nfar into the night.\\n\\nIt precisely happened that Fagerolles, who had been in the thick of\\nit since the morning, was gesticulating and shouting, trying to make\\nhimself heard above the hubbub.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, gentlemen, we need one more man here! Come, some willing person,\\nover here!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd at that moment, perceiving Claude, he darted forward and forcibly\\ndragged him off.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! as for you, you will just oblige me by sitting down there and\\nhelping us! Itâ\\x80\\x99s for the good cause, dash it all!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude abruptly found himself chairman of one of the counting\\ncommittees, and began to perform his functions with all the gravity of\\na timid man, secretly experiencing a good deal of emotion, as if the\\nhanging of his canvas would depend upon the conscientiousness he showed\\nin his work. He called out the names inscribed upon the voting-papers,\\nwhich were passed to him in little packets, while the scrutineers, on\\nsheets of paper prepared for the purpose, noted each successive vote\\nthat each candidate obtained. And all this went on amidst a most\\nfrightful uproar, twenty and thirty names being called out at the same\\ntime by different voices, above the continuous rumbling of the crowd.\\nAs Claude could never do anything without throwing passion into it, he\\nwaxed excited, became despondent whenever a voting-paper did not bear\\nFagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 name, and grew happy as soon as he had to shout out that\\nname once more. Moreover, he often tasted that delight, for his friend\\nhad made himself popular, showing himself everywhere, frequenting the\\ncafes where influential groups of artists assembled, even venturing\\nto expound his opinions there, and binding himself to young artists,\\nwithout neglecting to bow very low to the members of the Institute. Thus\\nthere was a general current of sympathy in his favour. Fagerolles was,\\nso to say, everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s spoilt child.\\n\\nNight came on at about six oâ\\x80\\x99clock that rainy March day. The assistants\\nbrought lamps; and some mistrustful artists, who, gloomy and silent,\\nwere watching the counting askance, drew nearer. Others began to play\\njokes, imitated the cries of animals, or attempted a _tyrolienne_. But\\nit was only at eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, when a collation of cold meat and wine\\nwas served, that the gaiety reached its climax. The bottles were hastily\\nemptied, the men stuffed themselves with whatever they were lucky enough\\nto get hold of, and there was a free-and-easy kind of Kermesse in that\\nhuge hall which the logs in the fireplace lit up with a forge-like glow.\\nThen they all smoked, and the smoke set a kind of mist around the\\nyellow light from the lamps, whilst on the floor trailed all the spoilt\\nvoting-papers thrown away during the polling; indeed, quite a layer of\\ndirty paper, together with corks, breadcrumbs, and a few broken plates.\\nThe heels of those seated at the table disappeared amidst this litter.\\nReserve was cast aside; a little sculptor with a pale face climbed upon\\na chair to harangue the assembly, and a painter, with stiff moustaches\\nunder a hook nose, bestrode a chair and galloped, bowing, round the\\ntable, in mimicry of the Emperor.\\n\\nLittle by little, however, a good many grew tired and went off. At\\neleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock there were not more than a couple of hundred persons\\npresent. Past midnight, however, some more people arrived, loungers in\\ndress-coats and white ties, who had come from some theatre or soiree\\nand wished to learn the result of the voting before all Paris knew it.\\nReporters also appeared; and they could be seen darting one by one out\\nof the room as soon as a partial result was communicated to them.\\n\\nClaude, hoarse by now, still went on calling names. The smoke and the\\nheat became intolerable, a smell like that of a cow-house rose from\\nthe muddy litter on the floor. One oâ\\x80\\x99clock, two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning\\nstruck, and he was still unfolding voting-papers, the conscientiousness\\nwhich he displayed delaying him to such a point that the other parties\\nhad long since finished their work, while his was still a maze of\\nfigures. At last all the additions were centralised and the definite\\nresult proclaimed. Fagerolles was elected, coming fifteenth among forty,\\nor five places ahead of Bongrand, who had been a candidate on the same\\nlist, but whose name must have been frequently struck out. And daylight\\nwas breaking when Claude reached home in the Rue Tourlaque, feeling both\\nworn out and delighted.\\n\\nThen, for a couple of weeks he lived in a state of anxiety. A dozen\\ntimes he had the idea of going to Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 for information, but a\\nfeeling of shame restrained him. Besides, as the committee proceeded\\nin alphabetical order, nothing perhaps was yet decided. However, one\\nevening, on the Boulevard de Clichy, he felt his heart thump as he saw\\ntwo broad shoulders, with whose lolloping motion he was well acquainted,\\ncoming towards him.\\n\\nThey were the shoulders of Bongrand, who seemed embarrassed. He was the\\nfirst to speak, and said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You know matters arenâ\\x80\\x99t progressing very well over yonder with those\\nbrutes. But everything isnâ\\x80\\x99t lost. Fagerolles and I are on the watch.\\nStill, you must rely on Fagerolles; as for me, my dear fellow, I am\\nawfully afraid of compromising your chances.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTo tell the truth, there was constant hostility between Bongrand and the\\nPresident of the hanging committee, Mazel, a famous master of the School\\nof Arts, and the last rampart of the elegant, buttery, conventional\\nstyle of art. Although they called each other â\\x80\\x98dear colleagueâ\\x80\\x99 and made\\na great show of shaking hands, their hostility had burst forth the very\\nfirst day; one of them could never ask for the admission of a picture\\nwithout the other one voting for its rejection. Fagerolles, who had been\\nelected secretary, had, on the contrary, made himself Mazelâ\\x80\\x99s amuser,\\nhis vice, and Mazel forgave his old pupilâ\\x80\\x99s defection, so skilfully\\ndid the renegade flatter him. Moreover, the young master, a regular\\nturncoat, as his comrades said, showed even more severity than the\\nmembers of the Institute towards audacious beginners. He only became\\nlenient and sociable when he wanted to get a picture accepted, on those\\noccasions showing himself extremely fertile in devices, intriguing and\\ncarrying the vote with all the supple deftness of a conjurer.\\n\\nThe committee work was really a hard task, and even Bongrandâ\\x80\\x99s strong\\nlegs grew tired of it. It was cut out every day by the assistants.\\nAn endless row of large pictures rested on the ground against the\\nhandrails, all along the first-floor galleries, right round the Palace;\\nand every afternoon, at one oâ\\x80\\x99clock precisely, the forty committee-men,\\nheaded by their president, who was equipped with a bell, started off\\non a promenade, until all the letters in the alphabet, serving as\\nexhibitorsâ\\x80\\x99 initials, had been exhausted. They gave their decisions\\nstanding, and the work was got through as fast as possible, the worst\\ncanvases being rejected without going to the vote. At times, however,\\ndiscussions delayed the party, there came a ten minutesâ\\x80\\x99 quarrel,\\nand some picture which caused a dispute was reserved for the evening\\nrevision. Two men, holding a cord some thirty feet long, kept it\\nstretched at a distance of four paces from the line of pictures, so as\\nto restrain the committee-men, who kept on pushing each other in the\\nheat of their dispute, and whose stomachs, despite everything, were\\never pressing against the cord. Behind the committee marched seventy\\nmuseum-keepers in white blouses, executing evolutions under the\\norders of a brigadier. At each decision communicated to them by the\\nsecretaries, they sorted the pictures, the accepted paintings being\\nseparated from the rejected ones, which were carried off like corpses\\nafter a battle. And the round lasted during two long hours, without a\\nmomentâ\\x80\\x99s respite, and without there being a single chair to sit upon.\\nThe committee-men had to remain on their legs, tramping on in a tired\\nway amid icy draughts, which compelled even the least chilly among them\\nto bury their noses in the depths of their fur-lined overcoats.\\n\\nThen the three oâ\\x80\\x99clock snack proved very welcome: there was half an\\nhourâ\\x80\\x99s rest at a buffet, where claret, chocolate, and sandwiches could\\nbe obtained. It was there that the market of mutual concessions was\\nheld, that the bartering of influence and votes was carried on. In order\\nthat nobody might be forgotten amid the hailstorm of applications which\\nfell upon the committee-men, most of them carried little note-books,\\nwhich they consulted; and they promised to vote for certain exhibitors\\nwhom a colleague protected on condition that this colleague voted for\\nthe ones in whom they were interested. Others, however, taking no part\\nin these intrigues, either from austerity or indifference, finished the\\ninterval in smoking a cigarette and gazing vacantly about them.\\n\\nThen the work began again, but more agreeably, in a gallery where\\nthere were chairs, and even tables with pens and paper and ink. All the\\npictures whose height did not reach four feet ten inches were judged\\nthere--â\\x80\\x98passed on the easel,â\\x80\\x99 as the expression goes--being ranged, ten\\nor twelve together, on a kind of trestle covered with green baize. A\\ngood many committee-men then grew absent-minded, several wrote their\\nletters, and the president had to get angry to obtain presentable\\nmajorities. Sometimes a gust of passion swept by; they all jostled each\\nother; the votes, usually given by raising the hand, took place amid\\nsuch feverish excitement that hats and walking-sticks were waved in the\\nair above the tumultuous surging of heads.\\n\\nAnd it was there, â\\x80\\x98on the easel,â\\x80\\x99 that â\\x80\\x98The Dead Childâ\\x80\\x99 at last made its\\nappearance. During the previous week Fagerolles, whose pocket-book was\\nfull of memoranda, had resorted to all kinds of complicated bartering\\nin order to obtain votes in Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s favour; but it was a difficult\\nbusiness, it did not tally with his other engagements, and he only met\\nwith refusals as soon as he mentioned his friendâ\\x80\\x99s name. He complained,\\nmoreover, that he could get no help from Bongrand, who did not carry a\\npocket-book, and who was so clumsy, too, that he spoilt the best causes\\nby his outbursts of unseasonable frankness. A score of times already\\nwould Fagerolles have forsaken Claude, had it not been for his obstinate\\ndesire to try his power over his colleagues by asking for the admittance\\nof a work by Lantier, which was a reputed impossibility. However, people\\nshould see if he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t yet strong enough to force the committee into\\ncompliance with his wishes. Moreover, perhaps from the depths of his\\nconscience there came a cry for justice, an unconfessed feeling of\\nrespect for the man whose ideas he had stolen.\\n\\nAs it happened, Mazel was in a frightfully bad humour that day. At the\\noutset of the sitting the brigadier had come to him, saying: â\\x80\\x98There\\nwas a mistake yesterday, Monsieur Mazel. A _hors-concours_* picture was\\nrejected. You know, No. 2520, a nude woman under a tree.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n  * A painting by one of those artists who, from the fact that they\\n    had obtained medals at previous Salons, had the right to go on\\n    exhibiting at long as they lived, the committee being debarred\\n    from rejecting their work however bad it might be.--ED.\\n\\nIn fact, on the day before, this painting had been consigned to the\\ngrave amid unanimous contempt, nobody having noticed that it was the\\nwork of an old classical painter highly respected by the Institute; and\\nthe brigadierâ\\x80\\x99s fright, and the amusing circumstance of a picture having\\nthus been condemned by mistake, enlivened the younger members of the\\ncommittee and made them sneer in a provoking manner.\\n\\nMazel, who detested such mishaps, which he rightly felt were disastrous\\nfor the authority of the School of Arts, made an angry gesture, and\\ndrily said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, fish it out again, and put it among the admitted pictures. It\\nisnâ\\x80\\x99t so surprising, there was an intolerable noise yesterday. How can\\none judge anything like that at a gallop, when one canâ\\x80\\x99t even obtain\\nsilence?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe rang his bell furiously, and added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, gentlemen, everything is ready--a little good will, if you\\nplease.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nUnluckily, a fresh misfortune occurred as soon as the first paintings\\nwere set on the trestle. One canvas among others attracted Mazelâ\\x80\\x99s\\nattention, so bad did he consider it, so sharp in tone as to make oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nvery teeth grate. As his sight was failing him, he leant forward to look\\nat the signature, muttering the while: â\\x80\\x98Whoâ\\x80\\x99s the pig--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut he quickly drew himself up, quite shocked at having read the name\\nof one of his friends, an artist who, like himself, was a rampart of\\nhealthy principles. Hoping that he had not been overheard, he thereupon\\ncalled out:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Superb! No. 1, eh, gentlemen?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNo. 1 was granted--the formula of admission which entitled the picture\\nto be hung on the line. Only, some of the committee-men laughed and\\nnudged each other, at which Mazel felt very hurt, and became very\\nfierce.\\n\\nMoreover, they all made such blunders at times. A great many of them\\neased their feelings at the first glance, and then recalled their words\\nas soon as they had deciphered the signature. This ended by making them\\ncautious, and so with furtive glances they made sure of the artistâ\\x80\\x99s\\nname before expressing any opinion. Besides, whenever a colleagueâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwork, some fellow committee-manâ\\x80\\x99s suspicious-looking canvas, was brought\\nforward, they took the precaution to warn each other by making signs\\nbehind the painterâ\\x80\\x99s back, as if to say, â\\x80\\x98Take care, no mistake, mind;\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s his picture.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFagerolles, despite his colleaguesâ\\x80\\x99 fidgety nerves, carried the day on\\na first occasion. It was a question of admitting a frightful portrait\\npainted by one of his pupils, whose family, a very wealthy one, received\\nhim on a footing of intimacy. To achieve this he had taken Mazel on\\none side in order to try to move him with a sentimental story about\\nan unfortunate father with three daughters, who were starving. But the\\npresident let himself be entreated for a long while, saying that a man\\nshouldnâ\\x80\\x99t waste his time painting when he was dying for lack of food,\\nand that he ought to have a little more consideration for his three\\ndaughters! However, in the result, Mazel raised his hand, alone, with\\nFagerolles. Some of the others then angrily protested, and even\\ntwo members of the Institute seemed disgusted, whereupon Fagerolles\\nwhispered to them in a low key:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s for Mazel! He begged me to vote. The painterâ\\x80\\x99s a relative of his,\\nI think; at all events, he greatly wants the picture to be accepted.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this the two academicians promptly raised their hands, and a large\\nmajority declared itself in favour of the portrait.\\n\\nBut all at once laughter, witticisms, and indignant cries rang out: â\\x80\\x98The\\nDead Childâ\\x80\\x99 had just been placed on the trestle. Were they to have the\\nMorgue sent to them now? said some. And while the old men drew back\\nin alarm, the younger ones scoffed at the childâ\\x80\\x99s big head, which was\\nplainly that of a monkey who had died from trying to swallow a gourd.\\n\\nFagerolles at once understood that the game was lost. At first he\\ntried to spirit the vote away by a joke, in accordance with his skilful\\ntactics:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, gentlemen, an old combatant--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut furious exclamations cut him short. Oh, no! not that one. They\\nknew him, that old combatant! A madman who had been persevering in his\\nobstinacy for fifteen years past--a proud, stuck-up fellow who posed for\\nbeing a genius, and who had talked about demolishing the Salon, without\\neven sending a picture that it was possible to accept. All their hatred\\nof independent originality, of the competition of the â\\x80\\x98shop over the\\nway,â\\x80\\x99 which frightened them, of that invincible power which triumphs\\neven when it is seemingly defeated, resounded in their voices. No, no;\\naway with it!\\n\\nThen Fagerolles himself made the mistake of getting irritated, yielding\\nto the anger he felt at finding what little real influence he possessed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are unjust; at least, be impartial,â\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\nThereupon the tumult reached a climax. He was surrounded and jostled,\\narms waved about him in threatening fashion, and angry words were shot\\nout at him like bullets.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You dishonour the committee, monsieur!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98If you defend that thing, itâ\\x80\\x99s simply to get your name in the\\nnewspapers!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You arenâ\\x80\\x99t competent to speak on the subject!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Fagerolles, beside himself, losing even the pliancy of his\\nbantering disposition, retorted:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m as competent as you are.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Shut up!â\\x80\\x99 resumed a comrade, a very irascible little painter with a\\nfair complexion. â\\x80\\x98You surely donâ\\x80\\x99t want to make us swallow such a turnip\\nas that?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nYes, yes, a turnip! They all repeated the word in tones of\\nconviction--that word which they usually cast at the very worst smudges,\\nat the pale, cold, glairy painting of daubers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right,â\\x80\\x99 at last said Fagerolles, clenching his teeth. â\\x80\\x98I demand the\\nvote.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSince the discussion had become envenomed, Mazel had been ringing his\\nbell, extremely flushed at finding his authority ignored.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Gentlemen--come, gentlemen; itâ\\x80\\x99s extraordinary that one canâ\\x80\\x99t settle\\nmatters without shouting--I beg of you, gentlemen--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt last he obtained a little silence. In reality, he was not a\\nbad-hearted man. Why should not they admit that little picture, although\\nhe himself thought it execrable? They admitted so many others!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, gentlemen, the vote is asked for.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe himself was, perhaps, about to raise his hand, when Bongrand, who\\nhad hitherto remained silent, with the blood rising to his cheeks in the\\nanger he was trying to restrain, abruptly went off like a pop-gun,\\nmost unseasonably giving vent to the protestations of his rebellious\\nconscience.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But, curse it all! there are not four among us capable of turning out\\nsuch a piece of work!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSome grunts sped around; but the sledge-hammer blow had come upon them\\nwith such force that nobody answered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Gentlemen, the vote is asked for,â\\x80\\x99 curtly repeated Mazel, who had\\nturned pale.\\n\\nHis tone sufficed to explain everything: it expressed all his latent\\nhatred of Bongrand, the fierce rivalry that lay hidden under their\\nseemingly good-natured handshakes.\\n\\nThings rarely came to such a pass as this. They almost always arranged\\nmatters. But in the depths of their ravaged pride there were wounds\\nwhich always bled; they secretly waged duels which tortured them with\\nagony, despite the smile upon their lips.\\n\\nBongrand and Fagerolles alone raised their hands, and â\\x80\\x98The Dead Child,â\\x80\\x99\\nbeing rejected, could only perhaps be rescued at the general revision.\\n\\nThis general revision was the terrible part of the task. Although, after\\ntwenty daysâ\\x80\\x99 continuous toil, the committee allowed itself forty-eight\\nhoursâ\\x80\\x99 rest, so as to enable the keepers to prepare the final work,\\nit could not help shuddering on the afternoon when it came upon the\\nassemblage of three thousand rejected paintings, from among which it\\nhad to rescue as many canvases as were necessary for the then regulation\\ntotal of two thousand five hundred admitted works to be complete. Ah!\\nthose three thousand pictures, placed one after the other alongside the\\nwalls of all the galleries, including the outer one, deposited also even\\non the floors, and lying there like stagnant pools, between which the\\nattendants devised little paths--they were like an inundation, a deluge,\\nwhich rose up, streamed over the whole Palais de lâ\\x80\\x99Industrie, and\\nsubmerged it beneath the murky flow of all the mediocrity and madness\\nto be found in the river of Art. And but a single afternoon sitting was\\nheld, from one till seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock--six hours of wild galloping through\\na maze! At first they held out against fatigue and strove to keep their\\nvision clear; but the forced march soon made their legs give way, their\\neyesight was irritated by all the dancing colours, and yet it was still\\nnecessary to march on, to look and judge, even until they broke down\\nwith fatigue. By four oâ\\x80\\x99clock the march was like a rout--the scattering\\nof a defeated army. Some committee-men, out of breath, dragged\\nthemselves along very far in the rear; others, isolated, lost amid the\\nframes, followed the narrow paths, renouncing all prospect of emerging\\nfrom them, turning round and round without any hope of ever getting to\\nthe end! How could they be just and impartial, good heavens? What\\ncould they select from amid that heap of horrors? Without clearly\\ndistinguishing a landscape from a portrait, they made up the number\\nthey required in pot-luck fashion. Two hundred, two hundred and\\nforty--another eight, they still wanted eight more. That one? No, that\\nother. As you like! Seven, eight, it was over! At last they had got to\\nthe end, and they hobbled away, saved--free!\\n\\nIn one gallery a fresh scene drew them once more round â\\x80\\x98The Dead Child,â\\x80\\x99\\nlying on the floor among other waifs. But this time they jested. A joker\\npretended to stumble and set his foot in the middle of the canvas, while\\nothers trotted along the surrounding little paths, as if trying to find\\nout which was the pictureâ\\x80\\x99s top and which its bottom, and declaring that\\nit looked much better topsy-turvy.\\n\\nFagerolles himself also began to joke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, a little courage, gentlemen; go the round, examine it, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be\\nrepaid for your trouble. Really now, gentlemen, be kind, rescue it; pray\\ndo that good action!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey all grew merry in listening to him, but with cruel laughter they\\nrefused more harshly than ever. â\\x80\\x98No, no, never!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Will you take it for your â\\x80\\x9ccharityâ\\x80\\x9d?â\\x80\\x99 cried a comrade.\\n\\nThis was a custom; the committee-men had a right to a â\\x80\\x98charityâ\\x80\\x99; each\\nof them could select a canvas among the lot, no matter how execrable it\\nmight be, and it was thereupon admitted without examination. As a rule,\\nthe bounty of this admission was bestowed upon poor artists. The forty\\npaintings thus rescued at the eleventh hour, were those of the beggars\\nat the door--those whom one allowed to glide with empty stomachs to the\\nfar end of the table.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98For my â\\x80\\x9ccharity,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99 repeated Fagerolles, feeling very much embarrassed;\\nâ\\x80\\x98the fact is, I meant to take another painting for my â\\x80\\x9ccharity.â\\x80\\x9d Yes,\\nsome flowers by a lady--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was interrupted by loud jeers. Was she pretty? In front of the\\nwomenâ\\x80\\x99s paintings the gentlemen were particularly prone to sneer, never\\ndisplaying the least gallantry. And Fagerolles remained perplexed, for\\nthe â\\x80\\x98ladyâ\\x80\\x99 in question was a person whom Irma took an interest in. He\\ntrembled at the idea of the terrible scene which would ensue should he\\nfail to keep his promise. An expedient occurred to him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, and you, Bongrand? You might very well take this funny little\\ndead child for your charity.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand, wounded to the heart, indignant at all the bartering, waved\\nhis long arms:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! _I_? _I_ insult a real painter in that fashion? Let him be\\nprouder, dash it, and never send anything to the Salon!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, as the others still went on sneering, Fagerolles, desirous that\\nvictory should remain to him, made up his mind, with a proud air, like\\na man who is conscious of his strength and does not fear being\\ncompromised.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98All right, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take it for my â\\x80\\x9ccharity,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\nThe others shouted bravo, and gave him a bantering ovation, with a\\nseries of profound bows and numerous handshakes. All honour to the brave\\nfellow who had the courage of his opinions! And an attendant carried\\naway in his arms the poor derided, jolted, soiled canvas; and thus\\nit was that a picture by the painter of â\\x80\\x98In the Open Airâ\\x80\\x99 was at last\\naccepted by the hanging committee of the Salon.\\n\\nOn the very next morning a note from Fagerolles apprised Claude, in\\na couple of lines, that he had succeeded in getting â\\x80\\x98The Dead Childâ\\x80\\x99\\nadmitted, but that it had not been managed without trouble. Claude,\\ndespite the gladness of the tidings, felt a pang at his heart; the note\\nwas so brief, and was written in such a protecting, pitying style, that\\nall the humiliating features of the business were apparent to him. For\\na moment he felt sorry over this victory, so much so that he would have\\nliked to take his work back and hide it. Then his delicacy of feeling,\\nhis artistic pride again gave way, so much did protracted waiting for\\nsuccess make his wretched heart bleed. Ah! to be seen, to make his\\nway despite everything! He had reached the point when conscience\\ncapitulates; he once more began to long for the opening of the Salon\\nwith all the feverish impatience of a beginner, again living in a state\\nof illusion which showed him a crowd, a press of moving heads acclaiming\\nhis canvas.\\n\\nBy degrees Paris had made it the fashion to patronise â\\x80\\x98varnishing\\ndayâ\\x80\\x99--that day formerly set aside for painters only to come and finish\\nthe toilets of their pictures. Now, however, it was like a feast of\\nearly fruit, one of those solemnities which set the city agog and\\nattract a tremendous crowd. For a week past the newspaper press, the\\nstreets, and the public had belonged to the artists. They held Paris in\\ntheir grasp; the only matters talked of were themselves, their exhibits,\\ntheir sayings or doings--in fact, everything connected with them. It\\nwas one of those infatuations which at last draw bands of country\\nfolk, common soldiers, and even nursemaids to the galleries on days\\nof gratuitous admission, in such wise that fifty thousand visitors are\\nrecorded on some fine Sundays, an entire army, all the rear battalions\\nof the ignorant lower orders, following society, and marching, with\\ndilated eyes, through that vast picture shop.\\n\\nThat famous â\\x80\\x98varnishing dayâ\\x80\\x99 at first frightened Claude, who was\\nintimidated by the thought of all the fine people whom the newspapers\\nspoke about, and he resolved to wait for the more democratic day of\\nthe real inauguration. He even refused to accompany Sandoz. But he was\\nconsumed by such a fever, that after all he started off abruptly at\\neight oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, barely taking time to eat a bit of bread\\nand cheese beforehand. Christine, who lacked the courage to go with him,\\nkissed him again and again, feeling anxious and moved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Mind, my dear, donâ\\x80\\x99t worry, whatever happens,â\\x80\\x99 said she.\\n\\nClaude felt somewhat oppressed as he entered the Gallery of Honour. His\\nheart was beating fast from the swiftness with which he had climbed the\\ngrand staircase. There was a limpid May sky out of doors, and through\\nthe linen awnings, stretched under the glazed roof, there filtered a\\nbright white light, while the open doorways, communicating with the\\ngarden gallery, admitted moist gusts of quivering freshness. For a\\nmoment Claude drew breath in that atmosphere which was already tainted\\nwith a vague smell of varnish and the odour of the musk with which the\\nwomen present perfumed themselves. At a glance he took stock of the\\npictures on the walls: a huge massacre scene in front of him, streaming\\nwith carmine; a colossal, pallid, religious picture on his left;\\na Government order, the commonplace delineation of some official\\nfestivity, on the right; and then a variety of portraits, landscapes,\\nand indoor scenes, all glaring sharply amid the fresh gilding of their\\nframes. However, the fear which he retained of the folks usually present\\nat this solemnity led him to direct his glances upon the gradually\\nincreasing crowd. On a circular settee in the centre of the gallery,\\nfrom which sprang a sheaf of tropical foliage, there sat three ladies,\\nthree monstrously fat creatures, attired in an abominable fashion, who\\nhad settled there to indulge in a whole dayâ\\x80\\x99s backbiting. Behind him\\nhe heard somebody crushing harsh syllables in a hoarse voice. It was an\\nEnglishman in a check-pattern jacket, explaining the massacre scene to\\na yellow woman buried in the depths of a travelling ulster. There were\\nsome vacant spaces; groups of people formed, scattered, and formed again\\nfurther on; all heads were raised; the men carried walking-sticks and\\nhad overcoats on their arms, the women strolled about slowly, showing\\ndistant profiles as they stopped before the pictures; and Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nartistic eye was caught by the flowers in their hats and bonnets, which\\nseemed very loud in tint amid the dark waves of the menâ\\x80\\x99s silk hats.\\nHe perceived three priests, two common soldiers who had found their\\nway there no one knew whence, some endless processions of gentlemen\\ndecorated with the ribbon of the Legion of Honour, and troops of girls\\nand their mothers, who constantly impeded the circulation. However, a\\ngood many of these people knew each other; there were smiles and bows\\nfrom afar, at times a rapid handshake in passing. And conversation was\\ncarried on in a discreet tone of voice, above which rose the continuous\\ntramping of feet.\\n\\nThen Claude began to look for his own picture. He tried to find his way\\nby means of the initial letters inscribed above the entrances of the\\ngalleries, but made a mistake, and went through those on the left hand.\\nThere was a succession of open entrances, a perspective of old tapestry\\ndoor-hangings, with glimpses of the distant pictures. He went as far\\nas the great western gallery, and came back by the parallel suite of\\nsmaller galleries without finding that allotted to the letter L. And\\nwhen he reached the Gallery of Honour again, the crowd had greatly\\nincreased. In fact, it was now scarcely possible for one to move about\\nthere. Being unable to advance, he looked around, and recognised a\\nnumber of painters, that nation of painters which was at home there\\nthat day, and was therefore doing the honours of its abode. Claude\\nparticularly remarked an old friend of the Boutin Studio--a young fellow\\nconsumed with the desire to advertise himself, who had been working for\\na medal, and who was now pouncing upon all the visitors possessed of any\\ninfluence and forcibly taking them to see his pictures. Then there was a\\ncelebrated and wealthy painter who received his visitors in front of his\\nwork with a smile of triumph on his lips, showing himself compromisingly\\ngallant with the ladies, who formed quite a court around him. And there\\nwere all the others: the rivals who execrated one another, although they\\nshouted words of praise in full voices; the savage fellows who covertly\\nwatched their comradesâ\\x80\\x99 success from the corner of a doorway; the timid\\nones whom one could not for an empire induce to pass through the\\ngallery where their pictures were hung; the jokers who hid the bitter\\nmortification of their defeat under an amusing witticism; the sincere\\nones who were absorbed in contemplation, trying to understand the\\nvarious works, and already in fancy distributing the medals. And\\nthe paintersâ\\x80\\x99 families were also there. One charming young woman was\\naccompanied by a coquettishly bedecked child; a sour-looking, skinny\\nmatron of middle-class birth was flanked by two ugly urchins in black;\\na fat mother had foundered on a bench amid quite a tribe of dirty brats;\\nand a lady of mature charms, still very good-looking, stood beside her\\ngrown-up daughter, quietly watching a hussy pass--this hussy being the\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s mistress. And then there were also the models--women who pulled\\none another by the sleeve, who showed one another their own forms in the\\nvarious pictorial nudities, talking very loudly the while and dressed\\nwithout taste, spoiling their superb figures by such wretched gowns\\nthat they seemed to be hump-backed beside the well-dressed dolls--those\\nParisiennes who owed their figures entirely to their dressmakers.\\n\\nWhen Claude got free of the crowd, he enfiladed the line of doorways\\non the right hand. His letter was on that side; but he searched the\\ngalleries marked with an L without finding anything. Perhaps his canvas\\nhad gone astray and served to fill up a vacancy elsewhere. So when he\\nhad reached the large eastern gallery, he set off along a number of\\nother little ones, a secluded suite visited by very few people, where\\nthe pictures seemed to frown with boredom. And there again he found\\nnothing. Bewildered, distracted, he roamed about, went on to the garden\\ngallery, searching among the superabundant exhibits which overflowed\\nthere, pallid and shivering in the crude light; and eventually, after\\nother distant excursions, he tumbled into the Gallery of Honour for the\\nthird time.\\n\\nThere was now quite a crush there. All those who in any way create a\\nstir in Paris were assembled together--the celebrities, the wealthy, the\\nadored, talent, money and grace, the masters of romance, of the drama\\nand of journalism, clubmen, racing men and speculators, women of every\\ncategory, hussies, actresses and society belles. And Claude, angered by\\nhis vain search, grew amazed at the vulgarity of the faces thus massed\\ntogether, at the incongruity of the toilets--but a few of which were\\nelegant, while so many were common looking--at the lack of majesty which\\nthat vaunted â\\x80\\x98societyâ\\x80\\x99 displayed, to such a point, indeed, that the fear\\nwhich had made him tremble was changed into contempt. Were these the\\npeople, then, who were going to jeer at his picture, provided it were\\nfound again? Two little reporters with fair complexions were completing\\na list of persons whose names they intended to mention. A critic\\npretended to take some notes on the margin of his catalogue; another\\nwas holding forth in professorâ\\x80\\x99s style in the centre of a party of\\nbeginners; a third, all by himself, with his hands behind his back,\\nseemed rooted to one spot, crushing each work beneath his august\\nimpassibility. And what especially struck Claude was the jostling\\nflock-like behaviour of the people, their banded curiosity in which\\nthere was nothing youthful or passionate, the bitterness of their\\nvoices, the weariness to be read on their faces, their general\\nappearance of suffering. Envy was already at work; there was the\\ngentleman who makes himself witty with the ladies; the one who, without\\na word, looks, gives a terrible shrug of the shoulders, and then goes\\noff; and there were the two who remain for a quarter of an hour leaning\\nover the handrail, with their noses close to a little canvas, whispering\\nvery low and exchanging the knowing glances of conspirators.\\n\\nBut Fagerolles had just appeared, and amid the continuous ebb and flow\\nof the groups there seemed to be no one left but him. With his hand\\noutstretched, he seemed to show himself everywhere at the same time,\\nlavishly exerting himself to play the double part of a young â\\x80\\x98masterâ\\x80\\x99\\nand an influential member of the hanging committee. Overwhelmed with\\npraise, thanks, and complaints, he had an answer ready for everybody\\nwithout losing aught of his affability. Since early morning he had been\\nresisting the assault of the petty painters of his set who found their\\npictures badly hung. It was the usual scamper of the first moment,\\neverybody looking for everybody else, rushing to see one another and\\nbursting into recriminations--noisy, interminable fury. Either the\\npicture was too high up, or the light did not fall upon it properly,\\nor the paintings near it destroyed its effect; in fact, some talked of\\nunhooking their works and carrying them off. One tall thin fellow\\nwas especially tenacious, going from gallery to gallery in pursuit of\\nFagerolles, who vainly explained that he was innocent in the matter and\\ncould do nothing. Numerical order was followed, the pictures for each\\nwall were deposited on the floor below and then hung up without anybody\\nbeing favoured. He carried his obligingness so far as to promise his\\nintervention when the galleries were rearranged after the medals had\\nbeen awarded; but even then he did not manage to calm the tall thin\\nfellow, who still continued pursuing him.\\n\\nClaude for a moment elbowed his way through the crowd to go and ask\\nFagerolles where his picture had been hung. But on seeing his friend\\nso surrounded, pride restrained him. Was there not something absurd and\\npainful about this constant need of anotherâ\\x80\\x99s help? Besides, he suddenly\\nreflected that he must have skipped a whole suite of galleries on the\\nright-hand side; and, indeed, there were fresh leagues of painting\\nthere. He ended by reaching a gallery where a stifling crowd was massed\\nin front of a large picture which filled the central panel of honour.\\nAt first he could not see it, there was such a surging sea of shoulders,\\nsuch a thick wall of heads, such a rampart of hats. People rushed\\nforward with gaping admiration. At length, however, by dint of rising on\\ntiptoe, he perceived the marvel, and recognised the subject, by what had\\nbeen told him.\\n\\nIt was Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 picture. And in that â\\x80\\x98Picnicâ\\x80\\x99 he found his own\\nforgotten work, â\\x80\\x98In the Open Air,â\\x80\\x99 the same light key of colour, the\\nsame artistic formula, but softened, trickishly rendered, spoilt by\\nskin-deep elegance, everything being â\\x80\\x98arrangedâ\\x80\\x99 with infinite skill to\\nsatisfy the low ideal of the public. Fagerolles had not made the mistake\\nof stripping his three women; but, clad in the audacious toilets of\\nwomen of society, they showed no little of their persons. As for the two\\ngallant gentlemen in summer jackets beside them, they realised the ideal\\nof everything most _distingue_; while afar off a footman was pulling a\\nhamper off the box of a landau drawn up behind the trees. The whole\\nof it, the figures, the drapery, the bits of still life of the repast,\\nstood out gaily in full sunlight against the darkened foliage of the\\nbackground; and the supreme skill of the painter lay in his pretended\\naudacity, in a mendacious semblance of forcible treatment which just\\nsufficed to send the multitude into ecstasies. It was like a storm in a\\ncream-jug!\\n\\nClaude, being unable to approach, listened to the remarks around him.\\nAt last there was a man who depicted real truth! He did not press\\nhis points like those fools of the new school; he knew how to convey\\neverything without showing anything. Ah! the art of knowing where to\\ndraw the line, the art of letting things be guessed, the respect due to\\nthe public, the approval of good society! And withal such delicacy, such\\ncharm and art! He did not unseasonably deliver himself of passionate\\nthings of exuberant design; no, when he had taken three notes from\\nnature, he gave those three notes, nothing more. A newspaper man who\\narrived went into raptures over the â\\x80\\x98Picnic,â\\x80\\x99 and coined the expression\\nâ\\x80\\x98a very Parisian style of painting.â\\x80\\x99 It was repeated, and people no\\nlonger passed without declaring that the picture was â\\x80\\x98very Parisianâ\\x80\\x99\\nindeed.\\n\\nAll those bent shoulders, all those admiring remarks rising from a sea\\nof spines, ended by exasperating Claude; and seized with a longing to\\nsee the faces of the folk who created success, he manoeuvred in such a\\nway as to lean his back against the handrail hard by. From that point,\\nhe had the public in front of him in the grey light filtering through\\nthe linen awning which kept the centre of the gallery in shade; whilst\\nthe brighter light, gliding from the edges of the blinds, illumined the\\npaintings on the walls with a white flow, in which the gilding of the\\nframes acquired a warm sunshiny tint. Claude at once recognised the\\npeople who had formerly derided him--if these were not the same, they\\nwere at least their relatives--serious, however, and enraptured, their\\nappearance greatly improved by their respectful attention. The evil\\nlook, the weariness, which he had at first remarked on their faces, as\\nenvious bile drew their skin together and dyed it yellow, disappeared\\nhere while they enjoyed the treat of an amiable lie. Two fat ladies,\\nopen-mouthed, were yawning with satisfaction. Some old gentlemen opened\\ntheir eyes wide with a knowing air. A husband explained the subject to\\nhis young wife, who jogged her chin with a pretty motion of the neck.\\nThere was every kind of marvelling, beatifical, astonished, profound,\\ngay, austere, amidst unconscious smiles and languid postures of the\\nhead. The men threw back their black silk hats, the flowers in the\\nwomenâ\\x80\\x99s bonnets glided to the napes of their necks. And all the faces,\\nafter remaining motionless for a moment, were then drawn aside and\\nreplaced by others exactly like them.\\n\\nThen Claude, stupefied by that triumph, virtually forgot everything\\nelse. The gallery was becoming too small, fresh bands of people\\nconstantly accumulated inside it. There were no more vacant spaces, as\\nthere had been early in the morning; no more cool whiffs rose from\\nthe garden amid the ambient smell of varnish; the atmosphere was now\\nbecoming hot and bitter with the perfumes scattered by the womenâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndresses. Before long the predominant odour suggested that of a wet dog.\\nIt must have been raining outside; one of those sudden spring showers\\nhad no doubt fallen, for the last arrivals brought moisture with\\nthem--their clothes hung about them heavily and seemed to steam as soon\\nas they encountered the heat of the gallery. And, indeed, patches of\\ndarkness had for a moment been passing above the awning of the roof.\\nClaude, who raised his eyes, guessed that large clouds were galloping\\nonward lashed by the north wind, that driving rain was beating upon\\nthe glass panes. Moire-like shadows darted along the walls, all\\nthe paintings became dim, the spectators themselves were blended in\\nobscurity until the cloud was carried away, whereupon the painter\\nsaw the heads again emerge from the twilight, ever agape with idiotic\\nrapture.\\n\\nBut there was another cup of bitterness in reserve for Claude. On the\\nleft-hand panel, facing Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99, he perceived Bongrandâ\\x80\\x99s picture.\\nAnd in front of that painting there was no crush whatever; the visitors\\nwalked by with an air of indifference. Yet it was Bongrandâ\\x80\\x99s supreme\\neffort, the thrust he had been trying to give for years, a last work\\nconceived in his obstinate craving to prove the virility of his decline.\\nThe hatred he harboured against the â\\x80\\x98Village Wedding,â\\x80\\x99 that first\\nmasterpiece which had weighed upon all his toilsome after-life, had\\nimpelled him to select a contrasting but corresponding subject: the\\nâ\\x80\\x98Village Funeralâ\\x80\\x99--the funeral of a young girl, with relatives and\\nfriends straggling among fields of rye and oats. Bongrand had wrestled\\nwith himself, saying that people should see if he were done for, if the\\nexperience of his sixty years were not worth all the lucky dash of his\\nyouth; and now experience was defeated, the picture was destined to be\\na mournful failure, like the silent fall of an old man, which does\\nnot even stay passers-by in their onward course. There were still some\\nmasterly bits, the choirboy holding the cross, the group of daughters\\nof the Virgin carrying the bier, whose white dresses and ruddy flesh\\nfurnished a pretty contrast with the black Sunday toggery of the rustic\\nmourners, among all the green stuff; only the priest in his alb, the\\ngirl carrying the Virginâ\\x80\\x99s banner, the family following the body, were\\ndrily handled; the whole picture, in fact, was displeasing in its very\\nscience and the obstinate stiffness of its treatment. One found in it a\\nfatal, unconscious return to the troubled romanticism which had been the\\nstarting-point of the painterâ\\x80\\x99s career. And the worst of the business\\nwas that there was justification for the indifference with which the\\npublic treated that art of another period, that cooked and somewhat dull\\nstyle of painting, which no longer stopped one on oneâ\\x80\\x99s way, since great\\nblazes of light had come into vogue.\\n\\nIt precisely happened that Bongrand entered the gallery with the\\nhesitating step of a timid beginner, and Claude felt a pang at his heart\\nas he saw him give a glance at his neglected picture and then another\\nat Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99, which was bringing on a riot. At that moment the old\\npainter must have been acutely conscious of his fall. If he had so\\nfar been devoured by the fear of slow decline, it was because he still\\ndoubted; and now he obtained sudden certainty; he was surviving his\\nreputation, his talent was dead, he would never more give birth to\\nliving, palpitating works. He became very pale, and was about to turn\\nand flee, when Chambouvard, the sculptor, entering the gallery by the\\nother door, followed by his customary train of disciples, called to him\\nwithout caring a fig for the people present:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! you humbug, I catch you at it--admiring yourself!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe, Chambouvard, exhibited that year an execrable â\\x80\\x98Reaping Woman,â\\x80\\x99 one\\nof those stupidly spoilt figures which seemed like hoaxes on his part,\\nso unworthy they were of his powerful hands; but he was none the less\\nradiant, feeling certain that he had turned out yet another masterpiece,\\nand promenading his god-like infallibility through the crowd which he\\ndid not hear laughing at him.\\n\\nBongrand did not answer, but looked at him with eyes scorched by fever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And my machine downstairs?â\\x80\\x99 continued the sculptor. â\\x80\\x98Have you seen\\nit? The little fellows of nowadays may try it on, but we are the only\\nmasters--we, old France!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd thereupon he went off, followed by his court and bowing to the\\nastonished public.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The brute!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Bongrand, suffocating with grief, as indignant as\\nat the outburst of some low-bred fellow beside a deathbed.\\n\\nHe perceived Claude, and approached him. Was it not cowardly to flee\\nfrom this gallery? And he determined to show his courage, his lofty\\nsoul, into which envy had never entered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Our friend Fagerolles has a success and no mistake,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98I\\nshould be a hypocrite if I went into ecstasies over his picture, which\\nI scarcely like; but he himself is really a very nice fellow indeed.\\nBesides, you know how he exerted himself on your behalf.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was trying to find a word of admiration for the â\\x80\\x98Village\\nFuneral.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The little cemetery in the background is so pretty!â\\x80\\x99 he said at last.\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is it possible that the public--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Bongrand interrupted him in a rough voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No compliments of condolence, my friend, eh? I see clear enough.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this moment somebody nodded to them in a familiar way, and Claude\\nrecognised Naudet--a Naudet who had grown and expanded, gilded by the\\nsuccess of his colossal strokes of business. Ambition was turning his\\nhead; he talked about sinking all the other picture dealers; he had\\nbuilt himself a palace, in which he posed as the king of the market,\\ncentralising masterpieces, and there opening large art shops of the\\nmodern style. One heard a jingle of millions on the very threshold\\nof his hall; he held exhibitions there, even ran up other galleries\\nelsewhere; and each time that May came round, he awaited the visits\\nof the American amateurs whom he charged fifty thousand francs for a\\npicture which he himself had purchased for ten thousand. Moreover, he\\nlived in princely style, with a wife and children, a mistress, a country\\nestate in Picardy, and extensive shooting grounds. His first large\\nprofits had come from the rise in value of works left by illustrious\\nartists, now defunct, whose talent had been denied while they lived,\\nsuch as Courbet, Millet, and Rousseau; and this had ended by making\\nhim disdain any picture signed by a still struggling artist. However,\\nominous rumours were already in circulation. As the number of well-known\\npictures was limited, and the number of amateurs could barely be\\nincreased, a time seemed to be coming when business would prove very\\ndifficult. There was talk of a syndicate, of an understanding with\\ncertain bankers to keep up the present high prices; the expedient of\\nsimulated sales was resorted to at the Hotel Drouot--pictures being\\nbought in at a big figure by the dealer himself--and bankruptcy seemed\\nto be at the end of all that Stock Exchange jobbery, a perfect tumble\\nhead-over-heels after all the excessive, mendacious _agiotage_.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-day, dear master,â\\x80\\x99 said Naudet, who had drawn near. â\\x80\\x98So you have\\ncome, like everybody else, to see my Fagerolles, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe no longer treated Bongrand in the wheedling, respectful manner of\\nyore. And he spoke of Fagerolles as of a painter belonging to him, of a\\nworkman to whom he paid wages, and whom he often scolded. It was he who\\nhad settled the young artist in the Avenue de Villiers, compelling him\\nto have a little mansion of his own, furnishing it as he would have\\nfurnished a place for a hussy, running him into debt with supplies of\\ncarpets and nick-nacks, so that he might afterwards hold him at his\\nmercy; and now he began to accuse him of lacking orderliness and\\nseriousness, of compromising himself like a feather-brain. Take that\\npicture, for instance, a serious painter would never have sent it to the\\nSalon; it made a stir, no doubt, and people even talked of its obtaining\\nthe medal of honour; but nothing could have a worse effect on high\\nprices. When a man wanted to get hold of the Yankees, he ought to know\\nhow to remain at home, like an idol in the depths of his tabernacle.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You may believe me or not, my dear fellow,â\\x80\\x99 he said to Bongrand, â\\x80\\x98but\\nI would have given twenty thousand francs out of my pocket to prevent\\nthose stupid newspapers from making all this row about my Fagerolles\\nthis year.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand, who, despite his sufferings, was listening bravely, smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98In point of fact,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98they are perhaps carrying indiscretion too\\nfar. I read an article yesterday in which I learnt that Fagerolles ate\\ntwo boiled eggs every morning.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe laughed over the coarse puffery which, after a first article on the\\nâ\\x80\\x98young masterâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x99 picture, as yet seen by nobody, had for a week past\\nkept all Paris occupied about him. The whole fraternity of reporters\\nhad been campaigning, stripping Fagerolles to the skin, telling their\\nreaders all about his father, the artistic zinc manufacturer, his\\neducation, the house in which he resided, how he lived, even revealing\\nthe colour of his socks, and mentioning a habit he had of pinching his\\nnose. And he was the passion of the hour, the â\\x80\\x98young masterâ\\x80\\x99 according\\nto the tastes of the day, one who had been lucky enough to miss the\\nPrix de Rome, and break off with the School of Arts, whose principles,\\nhowever, he retained. After all, the success of that style of painting\\nwhich aims merely at approximating reality, not at rendering it in all\\nits truth, was the fortune of a season which the wind brings and blows\\naway again, a mere whim on the part of the great lunatic city; the stir\\nit caused was like that occasioned by some accident, which upsets\\nthe crowd in the morning and is forgotten by night amidst general\\nindifference.\\n\\nHowever, Naudet noticed the â\\x80\\x98Village Funeral.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hullo! thatâ\\x80\\x99s your picture, eh?â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98So you wanted to give a\\ncompanion to the â\\x80\\x9cWeddingâ\\x80\\x9d? Well, I should have tried to dissuade you!\\nAh! the â\\x80\\x9cWeddingâ\\x80\\x9d! the â\\x80\\x9cWeddingâ\\x80\\x9d!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand still listened to him without ceasing to smile. Barely a twinge\\nof pain passed over his trembling lips. He forgot his masterpieces,\\nthe certainty of leaving an immortal name, he was only cognisant of the\\nvogue which that youngster, unworthy of cleaning his palette, had so\\nsuddenly and easily acquired, that vogue which seemed to be pushing him,\\nBongrand, into oblivion--he who had struggled for ten years before he\\nhad succeeded in making himself known. Ah! when the new generations\\nbury a man, if they only knew what tears of blood they make him shed in\\ndeath!\\n\\nHowever, as he had remained silent, he was seized with the fear that he\\nmight have let his suffering be divined. Was he falling to the baseness\\nof envy? Anger with himself made him raise his head--a man should die\\nerect. And instead of giving the violent answer which was rising to his\\nlips, he said in a familiar way:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You are right, Naudet, I should have done better if I had gone to bed\\non the day when the idea of that picture occurred to me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! there he is; excuse me!â\\x80\\x99 cried the dealer, making off.\\n\\nIt was Fagerolles showing himself at the entrance of the gallery. He\\ndiscreetly stood there without entering, carrying his good fortune with\\nthe ease of a man who knows what he is about. Besides, he was looking\\nfor somebody; he made a sign to a young man, and gave him an answer,\\na favourable one, no doubt, for the other brimmed over with gratitude.\\nThen two other persons sprang forward to congratulate him; a woman\\ndetained him, showing him, with a martyrâ\\x80\\x99s gesture, a bit of still life\\nhung in a dark corner. And finally he disappeared, after casting but one\\nglance at the people in raptures before his picture.\\n\\nClaude, who had looked and listened, was overwhelmed with sadness.\\nThe crush was still increasing, he now had nought before him but faces\\ngaping and sweating in the heat, which had become intolerable. Above the\\nnearer shoulders rose others, and so on and so on as far as the door,\\nwhence those who could see nothing pointed out the painting to each\\nother with the tips of their umbrellas, from which dripped the water\\nleft by the showers outside. And Bongrand remained there out of pride,\\nerect in defeat, firmly planted on his legs, those of an old combatant,\\nand gazing with limpid eyes upon ungrateful Paris. He wished to finish\\nlike a brave man, whose kindness of heart is boundless. Claude, who\\nspoke to him without receiving any answer, saw very well that there was\\nnothing behind that calm, gay face; the mind was absent, it had flown\\naway in mourning, bleeding with frightful torture; and thereupon, full\\nof alarm and respect, he did not insist, but went off. And Bongrand,\\nwith his vacant eyes, did not even notice his departure.\\n\\nA new idea had just impelled Claude onward through the crowd. He was\\nlost in wonderment at not having been able to discover his picture. But\\nnothing could be more simple. Was there not some gallery where people\\ngrinned, some corner full of noise and banter, some gathering of jesting\\nspectators, insulting a picture? That picture would assuredly be his. He\\ncould still hear the laughter of the bygone Salon of the Rejected. And\\nnow at the door of each gallery he listened to ascertain if it were\\nthere that he was being hissed.\\n\\nHowever, as he found himself once more in the eastern gallery, that hall\\nwhere great art agonises, that depository where vast, cold, and gloomy\\nhistorical and religious compositions are accumulated, he started, and\\nremained motionless with his eyes turned upward. He had passed through\\nthat gallery twice already, and yet that was certainly his picture up\\nyonder, so high up that he hesitated about recognising it. It looked,\\nindeed, so little, poised like a swallow at the corner of a frame--the\\nmonumental frame of an immense painting five-and-thirty feet long,\\nrepresenting the Deluge, a swarming of yellow figures turning\\ntopsy-turvy in water of the hue of wine lees. On the left, moreover,\\nthere was a pitiable ashen portrait of a general; on the right a\\ncolossal nymph in a moonlit landscape, the bloodless corpse of a\\nmurdered woman rotting away on some grass; and everywhere around there\\nwere mournful violet-shaded things, mixed up with a comic scene of some\\nbibulous monks, and an â\\x80\\x98Opening of the Chamber of Deputies,â\\x80\\x99 with a\\nwhole page of writing on a gilded cartouch, bearing the heads of the\\nbetter-known deputies, drawn in outline, together with their names.\\nAnd high up, high up, amid those livid neighbours, the little canvas,\\nover-coarse in treatment, glared ferociously with the painful grimace of\\na monster.\\n\\nAh! â\\x80\\x98The Dead Child.â\\x80\\x99 At that distance the wretched little creature was\\nbut a confused lump of flesh, the lifeless carcase of some shapeless\\nanimal. Was that swollen, whitened head a skull or a stomach? And those\\npoor hands twisted among the bedclothes, like the bent claws of a bird\\nkilled by cold! And the bed itself, that pallidity of the sheets, below\\nthe pallidity of the limbs, all that white looking so sad, those tints\\nfading away as if typical of the supreme end! Afterwards, however, one\\ndistinguished the light eyes staring fixedly, one recognised a childâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhead, and it all seemed to suggest some disease of the brain, profoundly\\nand frightfully pitiful.\\n\\nClaude approached, and then drew back to see the better. The light was\\nso bad that refractions darted from all points across the canvas. How\\nthey _had_ hung his little Jacques! no doubt out of disdain, or perhaps\\nfrom shame, so as to get rid of the childâ\\x80\\x99s lugubrious ugliness. But\\nClaude evoked the little fellow such as he had once been, and beheld him\\nagain over yonder in the country, so fresh and pinky, as he rolled\\nabout in the grass; then in the Rue de Douai, growing pale and stupid\\nby degrees, and then in the Rue Tourlaque, no longer able to carry his\\nhead, and dying one night, all alone, while his mother was asleep; and\\nhe beheld her also, that mother, the sad woman who had stopped at home,\\nto weep there, no doubt, as she was now in the habit of doing for\\nentire days. No matter, she had done right in not coming; â\\x80\\x98twas too\\nmournful--their little Jacques, already cold in his bed, cast on one\\nside like a pariah, and so brutalised by the dancing light that his face\\nseemed to be laughing, distorted by an abominable grin.\\n\\nBut Claude suffered still more from the loneliness of his work.\\nAstonishment and disappointment made him look for the crowd, the rush\\nwhich he had anticipated. Why was he not hooted? Ah! the insults of\\nyore, the mocking, the indignation that had rent his heart, but made\\nhim live! No, nothing more, not even a passing expectoration: this was\\ndeath. The visitors filed rapidly through the long gallery, seized with\\nboredom. There were merely some people in front of the â\\x80\\x98Opening of the\\nChamber,â\\x80\\x99 where they collected to read the inscriptions, and show each\\nother the deputiesâ\\x80\\x99 heads. At last, hearing some laughter behind him, he\\nturned round; but nobody was jeering, some visitors were simply making\\nmerry over the tipsy monks, the comic success of the Salon, which some\\ngentlemen explained to some ladies, declaring that it was brilliantly\\nwitty. And all these people passed beneath little Jacques, and not a\\nhead was raised, not a soul even knew that he was up there.\\n\\nHowever, the painter had a gleam of hope. On the central settee,\\ntwo personages, one of them fat and the other thin, and both of them\\ndecorated with the Legion of Honour, sat talking, reclining against the\\nvelvet, and looking at the pictures in front of them. Claude drew near\\nthem and listened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And I followed them,â\\x80\\x99 said the fat fellow. â\\x80\\x98They went along the Rue\\nSt. Honore, the Rue St. Roch, the Rue de la Chaussee dâ\\x80\\x99Antin, the Rue la\\nFayette--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you spoke to them?â\\x80\\x99 asked the thin man, who appeared to be deeply\\ninterested.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, I was afraid of getting in a rage.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude went off and returned on three occasions, his heart beating fast\\neach time that some visitor stopped short and glanced slowly from the\\nline to the ceiling. He felt an unhealthy longing to hear one word, but\\none. Why exhibit? How fathom public opinion? Anything rather than such\\ntorturing silence! And he almost suffocated when he saw a young married\\ncouple approach, the husband a good-looking fellow with little fair\\nmoustaches, the wife, charming, with the delicate slim figure of a\\nshepherdess in Dresden china. She had perceived the picture, and asked\\nwhat the subject was, stupefied that she could make nothing out of it;\\nand when her husband, turning over the leaves of the catalogue, had\\nfound the title, â\\x80\\x98The Dead Child,â\\x80\\x99 she dragged him away, shuddering, and\\nraising this cry of affright:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, the horror! The police oughtnâ\\x80\\x99t to allow such horrors!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Claude remained there, erect, unconscious and haunted, his eyes\\nraised on high, amid the continuous flow of the crowd which passed on,\\nquite indifferent, without one glance for that unique sacred thing,\\nvisible to him alone. And it was there that Sandoz came upon him, amid\\nthe jostling.\\n\\nThe novelist, who had been strolling about alone--his wife having\\nremained at home beside his ailing mother--had just stopped short,\\nheart-rent, below the little canvas, which he had espied by chance. Ah!\\nhow disgusted he felt with life! He abruptly lived the days of his youth\\nover again. He recalled the college of Plassans, his freaks with Claude\\non the banks of the Viorne, their long excursions under the burning sun,\\nand all the flaming of their early ambition; and, later on, when they\\nhad lived side by side, he remembered their efforts, their certainty of\\ncoming glory, that fine irresistible, immoderate appetite that had\\nmade them talk of swallowing Paris at one bite! How many times, at that\\nperiod, had he seen in Claude a great man, whose unbridled genius would\\nleave the talent of all others far behind in the rear! First had come\\nthe studio of the Impasse des Bourdonnais; later, the studio of the Quai\\nde Bourbon, with dreams of vast compositions, projects big enough to\\nmake the Louvre burst; and, meanwhile, the struggle was incessant; the\\npainter laboured ten hours a day, devoting his whole being to his work.\\nAnd then what? After twenty years of that passionate life he ended\\nthus--he finished with that poor, sinister little thing, which nobody\\nnoticed, which looked so distressfully sad in its leper-like solitude!\\nSo much hope and torture, a lifetime spent in the toil of creating, to\\ncome to that, to that, good God!\\n\\nSandoz recognised Claude standing by, and fraternal emotion made his\\nvoice quake as he said to him:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! so you came? Why did you refuse to call for me, then?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe painter did not even apologise. He seemed very tired, overcome with\\nsomniferous stupor.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, donâ\\x80\\x99t stay here,â\\x80\\x99 added Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s past twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and\\nyou must lunch with me. Some people were to wait for me at Ledoyenâ\\x80\\x99s;\\nbut I shall give them the go-by. Letâ\\x80\\x99s go down to the buffet; we shall\\npick up our spirits there, eh, old fellow?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd then Sandoz led him away, holding his arm, pressing it, warming it,\\nand trying to draw him from his mournful silence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, dash it all! you mustnâ\\x80\\x99t give way like that. Although they\\nhave hung your picture badly, it is all the same superb, a real bit of\\ngenuine painting. Oh! I know that you dreamt of something else! But you\\nare not dead yet, it will be for later on. And, just look, you ought\\nto be proud, for itâ\\x80\\x99s you who really triumph at the Salon this year.\\nFagerolles isnâ\\x80\\x99t the only one who pillages you; they all imitate you\\nnow; you have revolutionised them since your â\\x80\\x9cOpen Air,â\\x80\\x9d which they\\nlaughed so much about. Look, look! thereâ\\x80\\x99s an â\\x80\\x9copen airâ\\x80\\x9d effect, and\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s another, and here and there--they all do it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe waved his hand towards the pictures as he and Claude passed along\\nthe galleries. In point of fact, the dash of clear light, introduced by\\ndegrees into contemporary painting, had fully burst forth at last. The\\ndingy Salons of yore, with their pitchy canvases, had made way for\\na Salon full of sunshine, gay as spring itself. It was the dawn, the\\naurora which had first gleamed at the Salon of the Rejected, and which\\nwas now rising and rejuvenating art with a fine, diffuse light, full of\\ninfinite shades. On all sides you found Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s famous â\\x80\\x98bluey tinge,â\\x80\\x99\\neven in the portraits and the _genre_ scenes, which had acquired the\\ndimensions and the serious character of historical paintings. The old\\nacademical subjects had disappeared with the cooked juices of tradition,\\nas if the condemned doctrine had carried its people of shadows away with\\nit; rare were the works of pure imagination, the cadaverous nudities of\\nmythology and catholicism, the legendary subjects painted without faith,\\nthe anecdotic bits destitute of life--in fact, all the bric-a-brac of\\nthe School of Arts used up by generations of tricksters and fools; and\\nthe influence of the new principle was evident even among those artists\\nwho lingered over the antique recipes, even among the former masters\\nwho had now grown old. The flash of sunlight had penetrated to\\ntheir studios. From afar, at every step you took, you saw a painting\\ntranspierce the wall and form, as it were, a window open upon Nature.\\nSoon the walls themselves would fall, and Nature would walk in; for the\\nbreach was a broad one, and the assault had driven routine away in that\\ngay battle waged by audacity and youth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! your lot is a fine one, all the same, old fellow!â\\x80\\x99 continued\\nSandoz. â\\x80\\x98The art of to-morrow will be yours; you have made them all.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude thereupon opened his mouth, and, with an air of gloomy brutality,\\nsaid in a low voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What do I care if I _have_ made them all, when I havenâ\\x80\\x99t made myself?\\nSee here, itâ\\x80\\x99s too big an affair for me, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s what stifles me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe made a gesture to finish expressing his thought, his consciousness\\nof his inability to prove the genius of the formula he had brought with\\nhim, the torture he felt at being merely a precursor, the one who\\nsows the idea without reaping the glory, his grief at seeing himself\\npillaged, devoured by men who turned out hasty work, by a whole flight\\nof fellows who scattered their efforts and lowered the new form of\\nart, before he or another had found strength enough to produce the\\nmasterpiece which would make the end of the century a date in art.\\n\\nBut Sandoz protested, the future lay open. Then, to divert Claude, he\\nstopped him while crossing the Gallery of Honour and said:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just look at that lady in blue before that portrait! What a slap Nature\\ndoes give to painting! You remember when we used to look at the dresses\\nand the animation of the galleries in former times? Not a painting\\nthen withstood the shock. And yet now there are some which donâ\\x80\\x99t suffer\\novermuch. I even noticed over there a landscape, the general yellowish\\ntinge of which completely eclipsed all the women who approached it.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was quivering with unutterable suffering.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Pray, letâ\\x80\\x99s go,â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98Take me away--I canâ\\x80\\x99t stand it any longer.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey had all the trouble in the world to find a free table in the\\nrefreshment room. People were pressed together in that big, shady\\nretreat, girt round with brown serge drapery under the girders of the\\nlofty iron flooring of the upstairs galleries. In the background, and\\nbut partially visible in the darkness, stood three dressers displaying\\ndishes of preserved fruit symmetrically ranged on shelves; while, nearer\\nat hand, at counters placed on the right and left, two ladies, a dark\\none and a fair one, watched the crowd with a military air; and from the\\ndim depths of this seeming cavern rose a sea of little marble tables, a\\ntide of chairs, serried, entangled, surging, swelling, overflowing and\\nspreading into the garden, under the broad, pallid light which fell from\\nthe glass roof.\\n\\nAt last Sandoz saw some people rise. He darted forward and conquered the\\nvacant table by sheer struggling with the mob.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! dash it! we are here at all events. What will you have to eat?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude made a gesture of indifference. The lunch was execrable; there\\nwas some trout softened by over-boiling, some undercut of beef dried up\\nin the oven, some asparagus smelling of moist linen, and, in addition,\\none had to fight to get served; for the hustled waiters, losing their\\nheads, remained in distress in the narrow passages which the chairs were\\nconstantly blocking. Behind the hangings on the left, one could hear a\\nracket of saucepans and crockery; the kitchen being installed there on\\nthe sand, like one of those Kermesse cook-shops set up by the roadside\\nin the open air.\\n\\nSandoz and Claude had to eat, seated obliquely and half strangled\\nbetween two parties of people whose elbows almost ended by getting into\\ntheir plates; and each time that a waiter passed he gave their chairs\\na shake with his hips. However, the inconvenience, like the abominable\\ncookery, made one gay. People jested about the dishes, different tables\\nfraternised together, common misfortune brought about a kind of pleasure\\nparty. Strangers ended by sympathising; friends kept up conversations,\\nalthough they were seated three rows distant from one another, and\\nwere obliged to turn their heads and gesticulate over their neighboursâ\\x80\\x99\\nshoulders. The women particularly became animated, at first rather\\nanxious as to the crush, and then ungloving their hands, catching up\\ntheir skirts, and laughing at the first thimbleful of neat wine they\\ndrank.\\n\\nHowever, Sandoz, who had renounced finishing his meat, raised his voice\\namid the terrible hubbub caused by the chatter and the serving:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A bit of cheese, eh? And letâ\\x80\\x99s try to get some coffee.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, whose eyes looked dreamy, did not hear. He was gazing into the\\ngarden. From his seat he could see the central clump of verdure, some\\nlofty palms which stood in relief against the grey hangings with which\\nthe garden was decorated all round. A circle of statues was set out\\nthere; and you could see the back of a faun; the profile of a young\\ngirl with full cheeks; the face of a bronze Gaul, a colossal bit of\\nromanticism which irritated one by its stupid assumption of patriotism;\\nthe trunk of a woman hanging by the wrists, some Andromeda of the\\nPlace Pigalle; and others, and others still following the bends of the\\npathways; rows of shoulders and hips, heads, breasts, legs, and arms,\\nall mingling and growing indistinct in the distance. On the left\\nstretched a line of busts--such delightful ones--furnishing a most\\ncomical and uncommon suite of noses. There was the huge pointed nose\\nof a priest, the tip-tilted nose of a soubrette, the handsome classical\\nnose of a fifteenth-century Italian woman, the mere fancy nose of a\\nsailor--in fact, every kind of nose, both the magistrateâ\\x80\\x99s and the\\nmanufacturerâ\\x80\\x99s, and the nose of the gentleman decorated with the Legion\\nof Honour--all of them motionless and ranged in endless succession!\\n\\nHowever, Claude saw nothing of them; to him they were but grey spots\\nin the hazy, greenish light. His stupor still lasted, and he was only\\nconscious of one thing, the luxuriousness of the womenâ\\x80\\x99s dresses, of\\nwhich he had formed a wrong estimate amid the pushing in the galleries,\\nand which were here freely displayed, as if the wearers had been\\npromenading over the gravel in the conservatory of some chateau. All the\\nelegance of Paris passed by, the women who had come to show themselves,\\nin dresses thoughtfully combined and destined to be described in the\\nmorrowâ\\x80\\x99s newspapers. People stared a great deal at an actress, who\\nwalked about with a queen-like tread, on the arm of a gentleman who\\nassumed the complacent airs of a prince consort. The women of society\\nlooked like so many hussies, and they all of them took stock of one\\nanother with that slow glance which estimates the value of silk and the\\nlength of lace, and which ferrets everywhere, from the tips of boots\\nto the feathers upon bonnets. This was neutral ground, so to say;\\nsome ladies who were seated had drawn their chairs together, after\\nthe fashion in the garden of the Tuileries, and occupied themselves\\nexclusively with criticising those of their own sex who passed by. Two\\nfemale friends quickened their pace, laughing. Another woman, all alone,\\nwalked up and down, mute, with a black look in her eyes. Some others,\\nwho had lost one another, met again, and began ejaculating about\\nthe adventure. And, meantime, the dark moving mass of men came to a\\nstandstill, then set off again till it stopped short before a bit of\\nmarble, or eddied back to a bit of bronze. And among the mere bourgeois,\\nwho were few in number, though all of them looked out of their element\\nthere, moved men with celebrated names--all the _illustrations_ of\\nParis. A name of resounding glory re-echoed as a fat, ill-clad gentleman\\npassed by; the winged name of a poet followed as a pale man with a flat,\\ncommon face approached. A living wave was rising from this crowd in the\\neven, colourless light when suddenly a flash of sunshine, from behind\\nthe clouds of a final shower, set the glass panes on high aflame, making\\nthe stained window on the western side resplendent, and raining down\\nin golden particles through the still atmosphere; and then everything\\nbecame warm--the snowy statues amid the shiny green stuff, the soft\\nlawns parted by the yellow sand of the pathways, the rich dresses\\nwith their glossy satin and bright beads, even the very voices, whose\\nhilarious murmur seemed to crackle like a bright fire of vine shoots.\\nSome gardeners, completing the arrangements of the flower-beds, turned\\non the taps of the stand-pipes and promenaded about with their pots, the\\nshowers squirting from which came forth again in tepid steam from the\\ndrenched grass. And meanwhile a plucky sparrow, who had descended from\\nthe iron girders, despite the number of people, dipped his beak in the\\nsand in front of the buffet, eating some crumbs which a young woman\\nthrew him by way of amusement. Of all the tumult, however, Claude\\nonly heard the ocean-like din afar, the rumbling of the people rolling\\nonwards in the galleries. And a recollection came to him, he remembered\\nthat noise which had burst forth like a hurricane in front of his\\npicture at the Salon of the Rejected. But nowadays people no longer\\nlaughed at him; upstairs the giant roar of Paris was acclaiming\\nFagerolles!\\n\\nIt so happened that Sandoz, who had turned round, said to Claude:\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! thereâ\\x80\\x99s Fagerolles!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd, indeed, Fagerolles and Jory had just laid hands on a table near by\\nwithout noticing their friends, and the journalist, continuing in his\\ngruff voice a conversation which had previously begun, remarked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, I saw his â\\x80\\x9cDead Childâ\\x80\\x9d! Ah! the poor devil! what an ending!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Fagerolles nudged Jory, and the latter, having caught sight of his\\ntwo old comrades, immediately added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! that dear old Claude! How goes it, eh? You know that I havenâ\\x80\\x99t yet\\nseen your picture. But Iâ\\x80\\x99m told that itâ\\x80\\x99s superb.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Superb!â\\x80\\x99 declared Fagerolles, who then began to express his surprise.\\nâ\\x80\\x98So you lunched here. What an idea! Everything is so awfully bad. We two\\nhave just come from Ledoyenâ\\x80\\x99s. Oh! such a crowd and such hustling, such\\nmirth! Bring your table nearer and let us chat a bit.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey joined the two tables together. But flatterers and petitioners were\\nalready after the triumphant young master. Three friends rose up and\\nnoisily saluted him from afar. A lady became smilingly contemplative\\nwhen her husband had whispered his name in her ear. And the tall,\\nthin fellow, the artist whose picture had been badly hung, and who had\\npursued him since the morning, as enraged as ever, left a table where he\\nwas seated at the further end of the buffet, and again hurried forward\\nto complain, imperatively demanding â\\x80\\x98the lineâ\\x80\\x99 at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! go to the deuce!â\\x80\\x99 at last cried Fagerolles, his patience and\\namiability exhausted. And he added, when the other had gone off,\\nmumbling some indistinct threats: â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s true; a fellow does all he can\\nto be obliging, but those chaps would drive one mad! All of them on\\nthe â\\x80\\x9clineâ\\x80\\x9d! leagues of â\\x80\\x9clineâ\\x80\\x9d then! Ah! what a business it is to be a\\ncommittee-man! One wears out oneâ\\x80\\x99s legs, and one only reaps hatred as\\nreward.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, who was looking at him with his oppressed air, seemed to wake up\\nfor a moment, and murmured:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I wrote to you; I wanted to go and see you to thank you. Bongrand told\\nme about all the trouble you had. So thanks again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Fagerolles hastily broke in:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Tut, tut! I certainly owed that much to our old friendship. Itâ\\x80\\x99s I who\\nam delighted to have given you any pleasure.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe showed the embarrassment which always came upon him in presence of\\nthe acknowledged master of his youth, that kind of humility which filled\\nhim perforce when he was with the man whose mute disdain, even at this\\nmoment, sufficed to spoil all his triumph.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your picture is very good,â\\x80\\x99 slowly added Claude, who wished to be\\nkind-hearted and generous.\\n\\nThis simple praise made Fagerollesâ\\x80\\x99 heart swell with exaggerated,\\nirresistible emotion, springing he knew not whence; and this rascal, who\\nbelieved in nothing, who was usually so proficient in humbug, answered\\nin a shaky voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! my dear fellow, ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s very kind of you to tell me that!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz had at last obtained two cups of coffee, and as the waiter had\\nforgotten to bring any sugar, he had to content himself with some pieces\\nwhich a party had left on an adjoining table. A few tables, indeed,\\nhad now become vacant, but the general freedom had increased, and one\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s laughter rang out so loudly that every head turned round. The\\nmen were smoking, and a bluish cloud slowly rose above the straggling\\ntablecloths, stained by wine and littered with dirty plates and dishes.\\nWhen Fagerolles, on his aide, succeeded in obtaining two glasses of\\nchartreuse for himself and Jory, he began to talk to Sandoz, whom he\\ntreated with a certain amount of deference, divining that the novelist\\nmight become a power. And Jory thereupon appropriated Claude, who had\\nagain become mournful and silent.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You know, my dear fellow,â\\x80\\x99 said the journalist, â\\x80\\x98I didnâ\\x80\\x99t send you any\\nannouncement of my marriage. On account of our position we managed it on\\nthe quiet without inviting any guests. All the same, I should have liked\\nto let you know. You will excuse me, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe showed himself expansive, gave particulars, full of the happiness of\\nlife, and egotistically delighted to feel fat and victorious in front of\\nthat poor vanquished fellow. He succeeded with everything, he said.\\nHe had given up leader-writing, feeling the necessity of settling down\\nseriously, and he had risen to the editorship of a prominent art review,\\non which, so it was asserted, he made thirty thousand francs a year,\\nwithout mentioning certain profits realised by shady trafficking in\\nthe sale of art collections. The middle-class rapacity which he had\\ninherited from his mother, the hereditary passion for profit which had\\nsecretly impelled him to embark in petty speculations as soon as he had\\ngained a few coppers, now openly displayed itself, and ended by making\\nhim a terrible customer, who bled all the artists and amateurs who came\\nunder his clutches.\\n\\nIt was amidst this good luck of his that Mathilde, now all-powerful,\\nhad brought him to the point of begging her, with tears in his eyes, to\\nbecome his wife, a request which she had proudly refused during six long\\nmonths.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98When folks are destined to live together,â\\x80\\x99 he continued, â\\x80\\x98the best\\ncourse is to set everything square. You experienced it yourself, my\\ndear fellow; you know something about it, eh? And if I told you that she\\nwouldnâ\\x80\\x99t consent at first--yes, itâ\\x80\\x99s a fact--for fear of being misjudged\\nand of doing me harm. Oh! she has such grandeur, such delicacy of mind!\\nNo, nobody can have an idea of that womanâ\\x80\\x99s qualities. Devoted, taking\\nall possible care of one, economical, and acute, too, and such a good\\nadviser! Ah! it was a lucky chance that I met her! I no longer do\\nanything without consulting her; I let her do as she likes; she manages\\neverything, upon my word.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe truth was that Mathilde had finished by reducing him to the\\nfrightened obedience of a little boy. The once dissolute she-ghoul\\nhad become a dictatorial spouse, eager for respect, and consumed with\\nambition and love of money. She showed, too, every form of sourish\\nvirtue. It was said that they had been seen taking the Holy Communion\\ntogether at Notre Dame de Lorette. They kissed one another before\\nother people, and called each other by endearing nicknames. Only, of an\\nevening, he had to relate how he had spent his time during the day, and\\nif the employment of a single hour remained suspicious, if he did not\\nbring home all the money he had received, down to the odd coppers, she\\nled him the most abominable life imaginable.\\n\\nThis, of course, Jory left unmentioned. By way of conclusion he\\nexclaimed: â\\x80\\x98And so we waited for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s death, and then I married\\nher.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, whose mind had so far been wandering, and who had merely nodded\\nwithout listening, was struck by that last sentence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! you married her--married Mathilde?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThat exclamation summed up all the astonishment that the affair caused\\nhim, all the recollections that occurred to him of Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s shop.\\nThat Jory, why, he could still hear him talking about Mathilde in an\\nabominable manner; and yet he had married her! It was really stupid for\\na fellow to speak badly of a woman, for he never knew if he might not\\nend by marrying her some day or other!\\n\\nHowever, Jory was perfectly serene, his memory was dead, he never\\nallowed himself an allusion to the past, never showed the slightest\\nembarrassment when his comradesâ\\x80\\x99 eyes were turned on him. Besides,\\nMathilde seemed to be a new-comer. He introduced her to them as if they\\nknew nothing whatever about her.\\n\\nSandoz, who had lent an ear to the conversation, greatly interested by\\nthis fine business, called out as soon as Jory and Claude became silent:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s be off, eh? My legs are getting numbed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut at that moment Irma Becot appeared, and stopped in front of the\\nbuffet. With her hair freshly gilded, she had put on her best looks--all\\nthe tricky sheen of a tawny hussy, who seemed to have just stepped\\nout of some old Renaissance frame; and she wore a train of light blue\\nbrocaded silk, with a satin skirt covered with Alencon lace, of such\\nrichness that quite an escort of gentlemen followed her in admiration.\\nOn perceiving Claude among the others, she hesitated for a moment,\\nseized, as it were, with cowardly shame in front of that ill-clad, ugly,\\nderided devil. Then, becoming valiant, as it were, it was his hand that\\nshe shook the first amid all those well-dressed men, who opened their\\neyes in amazement. She laughed with an affectionate air, and spoke to\\nhim in a friendly, bantering way.\\n\\nFagerolles, however, was already paying for the two chartreuses he had\\nordered, and at last he went off with Irma, whom Jory also decided to\\nfollow. Claude watched them walk away together, she between the two men,\\nmoving on in regal fashion, greatly admired, and repeatedly bowed to by\\npeople in the crowd.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98One can see very well that Mathilde isnâ\\x80\\x99t here,â\\x80\\x99 quietly remarked\\nSandoz. â\\x80\\x98Ah! my friend, what clouts Jory would receive on getting home!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe novelist now asked for the bill. All the tables were becoming\\nvacant; there only remained a litter of bones and crusts. A couple of\\nwaiters were wiping the marble slabs with sponges, whilst a third raked\\nup the soiled sand. Behind the brown serge hangings the staff of the\\nestablishment was lunching--one could hear a grinding of jaws and husky\\nlaughter, a rumpus akin to that of a camp of gipsies devouring the\\ncontents of their saucepans.\\n\\nClaude and Sandoz went round the garden, where they discovered a statue\\nby Mahoudeau, very badly placed in a corner near the eastern vestibule.\\nIt was the bathing girl at last, standing erect, but of diminutive\\nproportions, being scarcely as tall as a girl ten years old, but\\ncharmingly delicate--with slim hips and a tiny bosom, displaying all the\\nexquisite hesitancy of a sprouting bud. The figure seemed to exhale a\\nperfume, that grace which nothing can give, but which flowers where it\\nlists, stubborn, invincible, perennial grace, springing still and ever\\nfrom Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s thick fingers, which were so ignorant of their special\\naptitude that they had long treated this very grace with derision.\\n\\nSandoz could not help smiling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And to think that this fellow has done everything he could to warp\\nhis talent. If his figure were better placed, it would meet with great\\nsuccess.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, great success,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Claude. â\\x80\\x98It is very pretty.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nPrecisely at that moment they perceived Mahoudeau, already in the\\nvestibule, and going towards the staircase. They called him, ran after\\nhim, and then all three remained talking together for a few minutes. The\\nground-floor gallery stretched away, empty, with its sanded pavement,\\nand the pale light streaming through its large round windows. One might\\nhave fancied oneself under a railway bridge. Strong pillars supported\\nthe metallic framework, and an icy chillness blew from above, moistening\\nthe sand in which oneâ\\x80\\x99s feet sank. In the distance, behind a torn\\ncurtain, one could see rows of statues, the rejected sculptural\\nexhibits, the casts which poor sculptors did not even remove,\\ngathered together in a livid kind of Morgue, in a state of lamentable\\nabandonment. But what surprised one, on raising oneâ\\x80\\x99s head, was the\\ncontinuous din, the mighty tramp of the public over the flooring of the\\nupper galleries. One was deafened by it; it rolled on without a pause,\\nas if interminable trains, going at full speed, were ever and ever\\nshaking the iron girders.\\n\\nWhen Mahoudeau had been complimented, he told Claude that he had\\nsearched for his picture in vain. In the depths of what hole could they\\nhave put it? Then, in a fit of affectionate remembrance for the past,\\nhe asked anxiously after Gagniere and Dubuche. Where were the Salons of\\nyore which they had all reached in a band, the mad excursions through\\nthe galleries as in an enemyâ\\x80\\x99s country, the violent disdain they had\\nfelt on going away, the discussions which had made their tongues swell\\nand emptied their brains? Nobody now saw Dubuche. Two or three times a\\nmonth Gagniere came from Melun, in a state of bewilderment, to attend\\nsome concert; and he now took such little interest in painting that he\\nhad not even looked in at the Salon, although he exhibited his usual\\nlandscape, the same view of the banks of the Seine which he had been\\nsending for the last fifteen years--a picture of a pretty greyish tint,\\nso conscientious and quiet that the public had never remarked it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I was going upstairs,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Mahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98Will you come with me?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, pale with suffering, raised his eyes every second. Ah! that\\nterrible rumbling, that devouring gallop of the monster overhead, the\\nshock of which he felt in his very limbs!\\n\\nHe held out his hand without speaking.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! are you going to leave us?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Sandoz. Take just another\\nturn with us, and weâ\\x80\\x99ll go away together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, on seeing Claude so weary, a feeling of pity made his heart\\ncontract. He divined that the poor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s courage was exhausted, that\\nhe was desirous of solitude, seized with a desire to fly off alone and\\nhide his wound.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then, good-bye, old man: Iâ\\x80\\x99ll call and see you to-morrow.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nStaggering, and as if pursued by the tempest upstairs, Claude\\ndisappeared behind the clumps of shrubbery in the garden. But two hours\\nlater Sandoz, who after losing Mahoudeau had just found him again with\\nJory and Fagerolles, perceived the unhappy painter again standing in\\nfront of his picture, at the same spot where he had met him the first\\ntime. At the moment of going off the wretched fellow had come up there\\nagain, harassed and attracted despite himself.\\n\\nThere was now the usual five oâ\\x80\\x99clock crush. The crowd, weary of winding\\nround the galleries, became distracted, and pushed and shoved without\\never finding its way out. Since the coolness of the morning, the heat of\\nall the human bodies, the odour of all the breath exhaled there had made\\nthe atmosphere heavy, and the dust of the floors, flying about, rose up\\nin a fine mist. People still took each other to see certain pictures,\\nthe subjects of which alone struck and attracted the crowd. Some\\nwent off, came back, and walked about unceasingly. The women were\\nparticularly obstinate in not retiring; they seemed determined to remain\\nthere till the attendants should push them out when six oâ\\x80\\x99clock began\\nto strike. Some fat ladies had foundered. Others, who had failed to find\\neven the tiniest place to sit down, leaned heavily on their parasols,\\nsinking, but still obstinate. Every eye was turned anxiously and\\nsupplicatingly towards the settees laden with people. And all that those\\nthousands of sight-seers were now conscious of, was that last fatigue of\\ntheirs, which made their legs totter, drew their features together, and\\ntortured them with headache--that headache peculiar to fine-art shows,\\nwhich is caused by the constant straining of oneâ\\x80\\x99s neck and the blinding\\ndance of colours.\\n\\nAlone on the little settee where at noon already they had been talking\\nabout their private affairs, the two decorated gentlemen were still\\nchatting quietly, with their minds a hundred leagues away from the\\nplace. Perhaps they had returned thither, perhaps they had not even\\nstirred from the spot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And so,â\\x80\\x99 said the fat one, â\\x80\\x98you went in, pretending not to understand?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Quite so,â\\x80\\x99 replied the thin one. â\\x80\\x98I looked at them and took off my hat.\\nIt was clear, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Astonishing! You really astonish me, my dear friend.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, however, only heard the low beating of his heart, and only\\nbeheld the â\\x80\\x98Dead Childâ\\x80\\x99 up there in the air, near the ceiling. He did\\nnot take his eyes off it, a prey to a fascination which held him there,\\nquite independent of his will. The crowd turned round him, peopleâ\\x80\\x99s feet\\ntrod on his own, he was pushed and carried away; and, like some inert\\nobject, he abandoned himself, waved about, and ultimately found himself\\nagain on the same spot as before without having once lowered his\\nhead, quite ignorant of what was occurring below, all his life being\\nconcentrated up yonder beside his work, his little Jacques, swollen\\nin death. Two big tears which stood motionless between his eyelids\\nprevented him from seeing clearly. And it seemed to him as if he would\\nnever have time to see enough.\\n\\nThen Sandoz, in his deep compassion, pretended he did not perceive his\\nold friend; it was as if he wished to leave him there, beside the tomb\\nof his wrecked life. Their comrades once more went past in a band.\\nFagerolles and Jory darted on ahead, and, Mahoudeau having asked Sandoz\\nwhere Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s picture was hung, the novelist told a lie, drew him aside\\nand took him off. All of them went away.\\n\\nIn the evening Christine only managed to draw curt words from Claude;\\neverything was going on all right, said he; the public showed no\\nill-humour; the picture had a good effect, though it was hung perhaps\\nrather high up. However, despite this semblance of cold tranquillity, he\\nseemed so strange that she became frightened.\\n\\nAfter dinner, as she returned from carrying the dirty plates into the\\nkitchen, she no longer found him near the table. He had opened a window\\nwhich overlooked some waste ground, and he stood there, leaning out\\nto such a degree that she could scarcely see him. At this she sprang\\nforward, terrified, and pulled him violently by his jacket.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Claude! Claude! what are you doing?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe turned round, with his face as white as a sheet and his eyes haggard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m looking,â\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\nBut she closed the window with trembling hands, and after that\\nsignificant incident such anguish clung to her that she no longer slept\\nat night-time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\nCLAUDE set to work again on the very next day, and months elapsed,\\nindeed the whole summer went by, in heavy quietude. He had found a job,\\nsome little paintings of flowers for England, the proceeds of which\\nsufficed for their daily bread. All his available time was again devoted\\nto his large canvas, and he no longer went into the same fits of anger\\nover it, but seemed to resign himself to that eternal task, evincing\\nobstinate, hopeless industry. However, his eyes retained their crazy\\nexpression--one could see the death of light, as it were, in them, when\\nthey gazed upon the failure of his existence.\\n\\nAbout this period Sandoz also experienced great grief. His mother died,\\nhis whole life was upset--that life of three together, so homely in\\nits character, and shared merely by a few friends. He began to hate the\\npavilion of the Rue Nollet, and, moreover, success suddenly declared\\nitself with respect to his books, which hitherto had sold but moderately\\nwell. So, prompted by the advent of comparative wealth, he rented in the\\nRue de Londres a spacious flat, the arrangements of which occupied him\\nand his wife for several months. Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s grief had drawn him closer to\\nClaude again, both being disgusted with everything. After the terrible\\nblow of the Salon, the novelist had felt very anxious about his old\\nchum, divining that something had irreparably snapped within him, that\\nthere was some wound by which life ebbed away unseen. Then, however,\\nfinding Claude so cold and quiet, he ended by growing somewhat\\nreassured.\\n\\nSandoz often walked up to the Rue Tourlaque, and whenever he found only\\nChristine at home, he questioned her, realising that she also lived in\\napprehension of a calamity of which she never spoke. Her face bore a\\nlook of worry, and now and again she started nervously, like a mother\\nwho watches over her child and trembles at the slightest sound, with the\\nfear that death may be entering the chamber.\\n\\nOne July morning Sandoz asked her: â\\x80\\x98Well, are you pleased? Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nquiet, he works a deal.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe gave the large picture her usual glance, a side glance full of\\nterror and hatred.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes, he works,â\\x80\\x99 she said. â\\x80\\x98He wants to finish everything else\\nbefore taking up the woman again.â\\x80\\x99 And without confessing the fear that\\nharassed her, she added in a lower tone: â\\x80\\x98But his eyes--have you noticed\\nhis eyes? They always have the same wild expression. I know very well\\nthat he lies, despite his pretence of taking things so easily. Pray,\\ncome and see him, and take him out with you, so as to change the current\\nof his thoughts. He only has you left; help me, do help me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAfter that Sandoz diligently devised motives for various walks, arriving\\nat Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s early in the morning, and carrying him away from his work\\nperforce. It was almost always necessary to drag him from his steps,\\non which he habitually sat, even when he was not painting. A feeling of\\nweariness stopped him, a kind of torpor benumbed him for long minutes,\\nduring which he did not give a single stroke with the brush. In those\\nmoments of mute contemplation, his gaze reverted with pious fervour to\\nthe womanâ\\x80\\x99s figure which he no longer touched: it was like a hesitating\\ndesire combined with sacred awe, a passion which he refused to satisfy,\\nas he felt certain that it would cost him his life. When he set to work\\nagain at the other figures and the background of the picture, he well\\nknew that the womanâ\\x80\\x99s figure was still there, and his glance wavered\\nwhenever he espied it; he felt that he would only remain master of\\nhimself as long as he did not touch it again.\\n\\nOne evening, Christine, who now visited at Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s and never missed a\\nsingle Thursday there, in the hope of seeing her big sick child of an\\nartist brighten up in the society of his friends, took the novelist\\naside and begged him to drop in at their place on the morrow. And on the\\nnext day Sandoz, who, as it happened, wanted to take some notes for\\na novel, on the other side of Montmartre, went in search of Claude,\\ncarried him off and kept him idling about until night-time.\\n\\nOn this occasion they went as far as the gate of Clignancourt, where a\\nperpetual fair was held, with merry-go-rounds, shooting-galleries, and\\ntaverns, and on reaching the spot they were stupefied to find themselves\\nface to face with Chaine, who was enthroned in a large and stylish\\nbooth. It was a kind of chapel, highly ornamented. There were four\\ncircular revolving stands set in a row and loaded with articles in china\\nand glass, all sorts of ornaments and nick-nacks, whose gilding and\\npolish shone amid an harmonica-like tinkling whenever the hand of a\\ngamester set the stand in motion. It then spun round, grating against\\na feather, which, on the rotatory movement ceasing, indicated what\\narticle, if any, had been won. The big prize was a live rabbit, adorned\\nwith pink favours, which waltzed and revolved unceasingly, intoxicated\\nwith fright. And all this display was set in red hangings, scalloped at\\nthe top; and between the curtains one saw three pictures hanging at the\\nrear of the booth, as in the sanctuary of some tabernacle. They were\\nChaineâ\\x80\\x99s three masterpieces, which now followed him from fair to fair,\\nfrom one end of Paris to the other. The â\\x80\\x98Woman taken in Adulteryâ\\x80\\x99 in the\\ncentre, the copy of the Mantegna on the left, and Mahoudeauâ\\x80\\x99s stove\\non the right. Of an evening, when the petroleum lamps flamed and the\\nrevolving stands glowed and radiated like planets, nothing seemed\\nfiner than those pictures hanging amid the blood-tinged purple of the\\nhangings, and a gaping crowd often flocked to view them.\\n\\nThe sight was such that it wrung an exclamation from Claude: â\\x80\\x98Ah, good\\nheavens! But those paintings look very well--they were surely intended\\nfor this.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Mantegna, so naively harsh in treatment, looked like some faded\\ncoloured print nailed there for the delectation of simple-minded\\nfolk; whilst the minutely painted stove, all awry, hanging beside\\nthe gingerbread Christ absolving the adulterous woman, assumed an\\nunexpectedly gay aspect.\\n\\nHowever, Chaine, who had just perceived the two friends, held out his\\nhand to them, as if he had left them merely the day before. He was calm,\\nneither proud nor ashamed of his booth, and he had not aged, having\\nstill a leathery aspect; though, on the other hand, his nose had\\ncompletely vanished between his cheeks, whilst his mouth, clammy with\\nprolonged silence, was buried in his moustache and beard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! so we meet again!â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, gaily. â\\x80\\x98Do you know, your\\npaintings have a lot of effect?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The old humbug!â\\x80\\x99 added Claude. â\\x80\\x98Why, he has his little Salon all to\\nhimself. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s very cute indeed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChaineâ\\x80\\x99s face became radiant, and he dropped the remark: â\\x80\\x98Of course!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, as his artistic pride was roused, he, from whom people barely\\nwrung anything but growls, gave utterance to a whole sentence:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s quite certain that if I had had any money, like you fellows, I\\nshould have made my way, just as you have done, in spite of everything.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThat was his conviction. He had never doubted of his talent, he had\\nsimply forsaken the profession because it did not feed him. When he\\nvisited the Louvre, at sight of the masterpieces hanging there he felt\\nconvinced that time alone was necessary to turn out similar work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, me!â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, who had become gloomy again. â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t regret what\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve done; you alone have succeeded. Business is brisk, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Chaine muttered bitter words. No, no, there was nothing doing, not\\neven in his line. People wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t play for prizes; all the money found\\nits way to the wine-shops. In spite of buying paltry odds and ends,\\nand striking the table with the palm of oneâ\\x80\\x99s hand, so that the feather\\nmight not indicate one of the big prizes, a fellow barely had water to\\ndrink nowadays. Then, as some people had drawn near, he stopped short in\\nhis explanation to call out: â\\x80\\x98Walk up, walk up, at every turn you win!â\\x80\\x99\\nin a gruff voice which the two others had never known him to possess,\\nand which fairly stupefied them.\\n\\nA workman who was carrying a sickly little girl with large covetous\\neyes, let her play two turns. The revolving stands grated and the\\nnick-nacks danced round in dazzling fashion, while the live rabbit, with\\nhis ears lowered, revolved and revolved so rapidly that the outline of\\nhis body vanished and he became nothing but a whitish circle. There\\nwas a moment of great emotion, for the little girl had narrowly missed\\nwinning him.\\n\\nThen, after shaking hands with Chaine, who was still trembling with the\\nfright this had given him, the two friends walked away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Heâ\\x80\\x99s happy,â\\x80\\x99 said Claude, after they had gone some fifty paces in\\nsilence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He!â\\x80\\x99 cried Sandoz; â\\x80\\x98why, he believes he has missed becoming a member of\\nthe Institute, and itâ\\x80\\x99s killing him.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShortly after this meeting, and towards the middle of August, Sandoz\\ndevised a real excursion which would take up a whole day. He had met\\nDubuche--Dubuche, careworn and mournful, who had shown himself plaintive\\nand affectionate, raking up the past and inviting his two old chums to\\nlunch at La Richaudiere, where he should be alone with his two children\\nfor another fortnight. Why shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t they go and surprise him there,\\nsince he seemed so desirous of renewing the old intimacy? But in vain\\ndid Sandoz repeat that he had promised Dubuche on oath to bring\\nClaude with him; the painter obstinately refused to go, as if he were\\nfrightened at the idea of again beholding Bennecourt, the Seine, the\\nislands, all the stretch of country where his happy years lay dead and\\nburied. It was necessary for Christine to interfere, and he finished\\nby giving way, although full of repugnance to the trip. It precisely\\nhappened that on the day prior to the appointment he had worked at his\\npainting until very late, being taken with the old fever again. And so\\nthe next morning--it was Sunday--being devoured with a longing to paint,\\nhe went off most reluctantly, tearing himself away from his picture with\\na pang. What was the use of returning to Bennecourt? All that was dead,\\nit no longer existed. Paris alone remained, and even in Paris there\\nwas but one view, the point of the Cite, that vision which haunted him\\nalways and everywhere, that one corner where he ever left his heart.\\n\\nSandoz, finding him nervous in the railway carriage, and seeing that\\nhis eyes remained fixed on the window as if he had been leaving the\\ncity--which had gradually grown smaller and seemed shrouded in mist--for\\nyears, did all he could to divert his mind, telling him, for instance,\\nwhat he knew about Dubucheâ\\x80\\x99s real position. At the outset, old\\nMargaillan, glorifying in his bemedalled son-in-law, had trotted him\\nabout and introduced him everywhere as his partner and successor. There\\nwas a fellow who would conduct business briskly, who would build houses\\nmore cheaply and in finer style than ever, for hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he grown pale\\nover books? But Dubucheâ\\x80\\x99s first idea proved disastrous; on some land\\nbelonging to his father-in-law in Burgundy he established a brickyard\\nin so unfavourable a situation, and after so defective a plan, that the\\nventure resulted in the sheer loss of two hundred thousand francs. Then\\nhe turned his attention to erecting houses, insisting upon bringing\\npersonal ideas into execution, a certain general scheme of his which\\nwould revolutionise the building art. These ideas were the old theories\\nhe held from the revolutionary chums of his youth, everything that he\\nhad promised he would realise when he was free; but he had not properly\\nreduced the theories to method, and he applied them unseasonably, with\\nthe awkwardness of a pupil lacking the sacred fire; he experimented with\\nterra-cotta and pottery ornamentation, large bay windows, and especially\\nwith the employment of iron--iron girders, iron staircases, and iron\\nroofings; and as the employment of these materials increased the outlay,\\nhe again ended with a catastrophe, which was all the greater as he was\\na pitiful manager, and had lost his head since he had become rich,\\nrendered the more obtuse, it seemed, by money, quite spoilt and at\\nsea, unable even to revert to his old habits of industry. This time\\nMargaillan grew angry; he for thirty years had been buying ground,\\nbuilding and selling again, estimating at a glance the cost and return\\nof house property; so many yards of building at so much the foot having\\nto yield so many suites of rooms at so much rent. He wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have\\nanything more to do with a fellow who blundered about lime, bricks,\\nmillstones, and in fact everything, who employed oak when deal would\\nhave suited, and who could not bring himself to cut up a storey--like a\\nconsecrated wafer--into as many little squares as was necessary. No, no,\\nnone of that! He rebelled against art, after having been ambitious\\nto introduce a little of it into his routine, in order to satisfy a\\nlong-standing worry about his own ignorance. And after that matters\\nhad gone from bad to worse, terrible quarrels had arisen between the\\nson-in-law and the father-in-law, the former disdainful, intrenching\\nhimself behind his science, and the latter shouting that the commonest\\nlabourer knew more than an architect did. The millions were in\\ndanger, and one fine day Margaillan turned Dubuche out of his offices,\\nforbidding him ever to set foot in them again, since he did not even\\nknow how to direct a building-yard where only four men worked. It was a\\ndisaster, a lamentable failure, the School of Arts collapsing, derided\\nby a mason!\\n\\nAt this point of Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s story, Claude, who had begun to listen to his\\nfriend, inquired:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then what is Dubuche doing now?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I donâ\\x80\\x99t know--nothing probably,â\\x80\\x99 answered Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98He told me that he\\nwas anxious about his childrenâ\\x80\\x99s health, and was taking care of them.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThat pale woman, Madame Margaillan, as slender as the blade of a knife,\\nhad died of tubercular consumption, which was plainly the hereditary\\ndisease, the source of the familyâ\\x80\\x99s degeneracy, for her daughter,\\nRegine, had been coughing ever since her marriage. She was now drinking\\nthe waters at Mont-Dore, whither she had not dared to take her children,\\nas they had been very poorly the year before, after a season spent\\nin that part, where the air was too keen for them. This explained the\\nscattering of the family: the mother over yonder with her maid;\\nthe grandfather in Paris, where he had resumed his great building\\nenterprises, battling amid his four hundred workmen, and crushing the\\nidle and the incapable beneath his contempt; and the father in exile at\\nLa Richaudiere, set to watch over his son and daughter, shut up there,\\nafter the very first struggle, as if it had broken him down for life. In\\na moment of effusion Dubuche had even let Sandoz understand that as his\\nwife was so extremely delicate he now lived with her merely on friendly\\nterms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A nice marriage,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, simply, by way of conclusion.\\n\\nIt was ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock when the two friends rang at the iron gate of La\\nRichaudiere. The estate, with which they were not acquainted, amazed\\nthem. There was a superb park, a garden laid out in the French style,\\nwith balustrades and steps spreading away in regal fashion; three huge\\nconservatories and a colossal cascade--quite a piece of folly, with its\\nrocks brought from afar, and the quantity of cement and the number of\\nconduits that had been employed in arranging it. Indeed, the owner had\\nsunk a fortune in it, out of sheer vanity. But what struck the friends\\nstill more was the melancholy, deserted aspect of the domain; the gravel\\nof the avenues carefully raked, with never a trace of footsteps; the\\ndistant expanses quite deserted, save that now and then a solitary\\ngardener passed by; and the house looking lifeless, with all its windows\\nclosed, excepting two, which were barely set ajar.\\n\\nHowever, a valet who had decided to show himself began to question\\nthem, and when he learnt that they wished to see â\\x80\\x98monsieur,â\\x80\\x99 he became\\ninsolent, and replied that â\\x80\\x98monsieurâ\\x80\\x99 was behind the house in the\\ngymnasium, and then went indoors again.\\n\\nSandoz and Claude followed a path which led them towards a lawn, and\\nwhat they saw there made them pause. Dubuche, who stood in front of a\\ntrapeze, was raising his arms to support his son, Gaston, a poor sickly\\nboy who, at ten years of age, still had the slight, soft limbs of early\\nchildhood; while the girl, Alice, sat in a perambulator awaiting her\\nturn. She was so imperfectly developed that, although she was six years\\nold, she could not yet walk. The father, absorbed in his task, continued\\nexercising the slim limbs of his little boy, swinging him backwards and\\nforwards, and vainly trying to make him raise himself up by his wrists.\\nThen, as this slight effort sufficed to bring on perspiration, he\\nremoved the little fellow from the trapeze and rolled him in a rug. And\\nall this was done amid complete silence, alone under the far expanse of\\nsky, his face wearing a look of distressful pity as he knelt there in\\nthat splendid park. However, as he rose up he perceived the two friends.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! itâ\\x80\\x99s you? On a Sunday, and without warning me!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had made a gesture of annoyance, and at once explained that the maid,\\nthe only woman to whom he could trust the children, went to Paris on\\nSundays, and that it was consequently impossible for him to leave Gaston\\nand Alice for a minute.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wager that you came to lunch?â\\x80\\x99 he added.\\n\\nAs Claude gave Sandoz an imploring glance, the novelist made haste to\\nanswer:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no. As it happens, we only have time enough to shake hands with\\nyou. Claude had to come down here on a business matter. He lived at\\nBennecourt, as you know. And as I accompanied him, we took it into our\\nheads to walk as far as here. But there are people waiting for us, so\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t disturb yourself in the least.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon, Dubuche, who felt relieved, made a show of detaining them.\\nThey certainly had an hour to spare, dash it all! And they all three\\nbegan to talk. Claude looked at Dubuche, astonished to find him so aged;\\nhis flabby face had become wrinkled--it was of a yellowish hue, and\\nstreaked with red, as if bile had splashed his skin; whilst his hair\\nand his moustaches were already growing grey. In addition, his figure\\nappeared to have become more compact; a bitter weariness made each of\\nhis gestures seem an effort. Were defeats in money matters as hard to\\nbear, then, as defeats in art? Everything about this vanquished man--his\\nvoice, his glance--proclaimed the shameful dependency in which he had to\\nlive: the bankruptcy of his future which was cast in his teeth, with the\\naccusation of having allowed a talent he did not possess to be set down\\nas an asset in the marriage contract. Then there was the family money\\nwhich he nowadays stole, the money spent on what he ate, the clothes he\\nwore, and the pocket-money he needed--in fact, the perpetual alms which\\nwere bestowed upon him, just as they might have been bestowed upon some\\nvulgar swindler, whom one unluckily could not get rid of.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Wait a bit,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Dubuche; â\\x80\\x98I have to stop here five minutes longer\\nwith one of my poor duckies, and afterwards weâ\\x80\\x99ll go indoors.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGently, and with infinite motherly precautions, he removed little Alice\\nfrom the perambulator and lifted her to the trapeze. Then, stammering\\ncoaxing words and smiling, he encouraged her, and left her hanging for\\na couple of minutes, so as to develop her muscles; but he remained with\\nopen arms, watching each movement with the fear of seeing her smashed to\\npieces, should her weak little wax-like hands relax their hold. She\\ndid not say anything, but obeyed him in spite of the terror that this\\nexercise caused her; and she was so pitifully light in weight that\\nshe did not even fully stretch the ropes, being like one of those poor\\nscraggy little birds which fall from a young tree without as much as\\nbending it.\\n\\nAt this moment, Dubuche, having given Gaston a glance, became distracted\\non remarking that the rug had slipped and that the childâ\\x80\\x99s legs were\\nuncovered.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good heavens! good heavens! Why, heâ\\x80\\x99ll catch cold on this grass! And I,\\nwho canâ\\x80\\x99t move! Gaston, my little dear! Itâ\\x80\\x99s the same thing every day;\\nyou wait till Iâ\\x80\\x99m occupied with your sister. Sandoz, pray cover him\\nover! Ah, thanks! Pull the rug up more; donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo this was the outcome of his splendid marriage--those two poor, weak\\nlittle beings, whom the least breath from the sky threatened to kill\\nlike flies. Of the fortune he had married, all that remained to him was\\nthe constant grief of beholding those woeful children stricken by\\nthe final degeneracy of scrofula and phthisis. However, this big,\\negotistical fellow showed himself an admirable father. The only energy\\nthat remained to him consisted in a determination to make his children\\nlive, and he struggled on hour after hour, saving them every morning,\\nand dreading to lose them every night. They alone existed now amid his\\nfinished existence, amid the bitterness of his father-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s insulting\\nreproaches, the coldness of his sorry, ailing wife. And he kept to his\\ntask in desperation; he finished bringing those children into the world,\\nas it were, by dint of unremitting tenderness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, my darling, thatâ\\x80\\x99s enough, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x99 he said. â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll soon see\\nhow big and pretty youâ\\x80\\x99ll become.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe then placed Alice in the perambulator again, took Gaston, who was\\nstill wrapped up, on one of his arms; and when his friends wished to\\nhelp him, he declined their offer, pushing the little girlâ\\x80\\x99s vehicle\\nalong with his right hand, which had remained free.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thanks,â\\x80\\x99 he said, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m accustomed to it. Ah! the poor darlings are not\\nheavy; and besides, with servants one can never be sure of anything.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn entering the house, Sandoz and Claude again saw the valet who had\\nbeen so insolent; and they noticed that Dubuche trembled before him. The\\nkitchen and the hall shared the contempt of the father-in-law, who\\npaid for everything, and treated â\\x80\\x98madameâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x99 husband like a beggar whose\\npresence was merely tolerated out of charity. Each time that a shirt\\nwas got ready for him, each time that he asked for some more bread, the\\nservantsâ\\x80\\x99 impolite gestures made him feel that he was receiving alms.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, good-bye, we must leave you,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, who suffered at the\\nsight of it all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no, wait a bit. The children are going to breakfast, and afterwards\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll accompany you with them. They must go for their outing.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nEach day was regulated hour by hour. Of a morning came the baths and\\nthe gymnastics; then the breakfast, which was quite an affair, as the\\nchildren needed special food, which was duly discussed and weighed. And\\nmatters were carried to such a point that even their wine and water was\\nslightly warmed, for fear that too chilly a drop might give them a cold.\\nOn this occasion they each partook of the yolk of an egg diluted in some\\nbroth, and a mutton cutlet, which the father cut up into tiny morsels.\\nThen, prior to the siesta, came the promenade.\\n\\nSandoz and Claude found themselves once more out-of-doors, walking\\ndown the broad avenues with Dubuche, who again propelled Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s\\nperambulator, whilst Gaston walked beside him. They talked about the\\nestate as they went towards the gate. The master glanced over the park\\nwith timid, nervous eyes, as if he did not feel at home. Besides he did\\nnot know anything; he did not occupy himself about anything. He appeared\\neven to have forgotten the profession which he was said to be ignorant\\nof, and seemed to have gone astray, to be bowed down by sheer inaction.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And your parents, how are they?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz.\\n\\nA spark was once more kindled in Dubucheâ\\x80\\x99s dim eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! my parents are happy,â\\x80\\x99 he said; â\\x80\\x98I bought them a little house,\\nwhere they live on the annuity which I had specified in my marriage\\ncontract. Well, you see, mamma had advanced enough money for my\\neducation, and I had to return it to her, as I had promised, eh? Yes, I\\ncan at least say that my parents have nothing to reproach me with.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHaving reached the gate, they tarried there for a few minutes. At last,\\nstill looking crushed, Dubuche shook hands with his old comrades; and\\nretaining Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s hand in his, he concluded, as if making a simple\\nstatement of fact quite devoid of anger:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Good-bye; try to get out of worry! As for me, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve spoilt my life.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd they watched him walk back towards the house, pushing the\\nperambulator, and supporting Gaston, who was already stumbling with\\nfatigue--he, Dubuche, himself having his back bent and the heavy tread\\nof an old man.\\n\\nOne oâ\\x80\\x99clock was striking, and they both hurried down towards Bennecourt,\\nsaddened and ravenous. But mournfulness awaited them there as well; a\\nmurderous blast had swept over the place, both Faucheurs, husband and\\nwife, and old Porrette, were all dead; and the inn, having fallen into\\nthe hands of that goose Melie, was becoming repugnant with its filth and\\ncoarseness. An abominable repast was served them, an omelette with hairs\\nin it, and cutlets smelling of grease, in the centre of the common room,\\nto which an open window admitted the pestilential odour of a dung heap,\\nwhile the place was so full of flies that they positively blackened the\\ntables. The heat of the burning afternoon came in with the stench, and\\nClaude and Sandoz did not even feel the courage to order any coffee;\\nthey fled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And you who used to extol old Mother Faucheurâ\\x80\\x99s omelettes!â\\x80\\x99 said\\nSandoz. â\\x80\\x98The place is done for. We are going for a turn, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was inclined to refuse. Ever since the morning he had had but\\none idea--that of walking on as fast as possible, as if each step would\\nshorten the disagreeable task and bring him back to Paris. His heart,\\nhis head, his whole being had remained there. He looked neither to right\\nnor to left, he glided along without distinguishing aught of the\\nfields or trees, having but one fixed idea in his brain, a prey to such\\nhallucinations that at certain moments he fancied the point of the\\nCite rose up and called to him from amid the vast expanse of stubble.\\nHowever, Sandozâ\\x80\\x99s proposal aroused memories in his mind; and, softening\\nsomewhat, he replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, thatâ\\x80\\x99s it, weâ\\x80\\x99ll have a look.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut as they advanced along the river bank, he became indignant and\\ngrieved. He could scarcely recognise the place. A bridge had been built\\nto connect Bennecourt with Bonnieres: a bridge, good heavens! in the\\nplace of the old ferry-boat, grating against its chain--the old black\\nboat which, cutting athwart the current, had been so full of interest to\\nthe artistic eye. Moreover, a dam established down-stream at Port-Villez\\nhad raised the level of the river, most of the islands of yore were\\nnow submerged, and the little armlets of the stream had become broader.\\nThere were no more pretty nooks, no more rippling alleys amid which one\\ncould lose oneself; it was a disaster that inclined one to strangle all\\nthe river engineers!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, that clump of pollards still emerging from the water on the left,â\\x80\\x99\\ncried Claude, â\\x80\\x98was the Barreux Island, where we used to chat together,\\nlying on the grass! You remember, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? Ah! the scoundrels!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz, who could never see a tree felled without shaking his fist at\\nthe wood-cutter, turned pale with anger, and felt exasperated that the\\nauthorities had thus dared to mutilate nature.\\n\\nThen, as Claude approached his old home, he became silent, and his teeth\\nclenched. The house had been sold to some middle-class folk, and\\nnow there was an iron gate, against which he pressed his face. The\\nrose-bushes were all dead, the apricot trees were dead also; the garden,\\nwhich looked very trim, with its little pathways and its square-cut beds\\nof flowers and vegetables, bordered with box, was reflected in a large\\nball of plated glass set upon a stand in the very centre of it; and the\\nhouse, newly whitewashed and painted at the corners and round the doors\\nand windows, in a manner to imitate freestone, suggested some clownish\\nparvenu awkwardly arrayed in his Sunday toggery. The sight fairly\\nenraged the painter. No, no, nothing of himself, nothing of Christine,\\nnothing of the great love of their youth remained there! He wished to\\nlook still further; he turned round behind the house, and sought for\\nthe wood of oak trees where they had left the living quiver of their\\nembraces; but the wood was dead, dead like all the rest, felled, sold,\\nand burnt! Then he made a gesture of anathema, in which he cast all his\\ngrief to that stretch of country which was now so changed that he could\\nnot find in it one single token of his past life. And so a few years\\nsufficed to efface the spot where one had laboured, loved, and suffered!\\nWhat was the use of manâ\\x80\\x99s vain agitation if the wind behind him swept\\nand carried away all the traces of his footsteps? He had rightly\\nrealised that he ought not to return thither, for the past is simply\\nthe cemetery of our illusions, where our feet for ever stumble against\\ntombstones!\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Let us go!â\\x80\\x99 he cried; â\\x80\\x98let us go at once! Itâ\\x80\\x99s stupid to torture oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nheart like this!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhen they were on the new bridge, Sandoz tried to calm him by showing\\nhim the view which had not formerly existed, the widened bed of the\\nSeine, full to the brim, as it were, and the water flowing onward,\\nproudly and slowly. But this water failed to interest Claude, until he\\nreflected that it was the same water which, as it passed through Paris,\\nhad bathed the old quay walls of the Cite; and then he felt touched, he\\nleant over the parapet of the bridge for a moment, and thought that he\\ncould distinguish glorious reflections in it--the towers of Notre-Dame,\\nand the needle-like spire of the Sainte-Chapelle, carried along by the\\ncurrent towards the sea.\\n\\nThe two friends missed the three oâ\\x80\\x99clock train, and it was real torture\\nto have to spend two long hours more in that region, where everything\\nweighed so heavily on their shoulders. Fortunately, they had forewarned\\nChristine and Madame Sandoz that they might return by a night train\\nif they were detained. So they resolved upon a bachelor dinner at a\\nrestaurant on the Place du Havre, hoping to set themselves all right\\nagain by a good chat at dessert as in former times. Eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock was\\nabout to strike when they sat down to table.\\n\\nClaude, on leaving the terminus, with his feet once more on the Paris\\npavement, had lost his nervous agitation, like a man who at last finds\\nhimself once more at home. And with the cold, absent-minded air which he\\nnow usually displayed, he listened to Sandoz trying to enliven him.\\nThe novelist treated his friend like a mistress whose head he wished to\\nturn; they partook of delicate, highly spiced dishes and heady wines.\\nBut mirth was rebellious, and Sandoz himself ended by becoming gloomy.\\nAll his hopes of immortality were shaken by his excursion to that\\nungrateful country village, that Bennecourt, so loved and so forgetful,\\nwhere he and Claude had not found a single stone retaining any\\nrecollection of them. If things which are eternal forget so soon, can\\none place any reliance for one hour on the memory of man?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do you know, old fellow,â\\x80\\x99 said the novelist, â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s that which sometimes\\nsends me into a cold sweat. Have you ever reflected that posterity may\\nnot be the faultless dispenser of justice that we dream of? One consoles\\noneself for being insulted and denied, by relying on the equity of the\\ncenturies to come; just as the faithful endure all the abominations of\\nthis earth in the firm belief of another life, in which each will be\\nrewarded according to his deserts. But suppose Paradise exists no\\nmore for the artist than it does for the Catholic, suppose that future\\ngenerations prolong the misunderstanding and prefer amiable little\\ntrifles to vigorous works! Ah! what a sell it would be, eh? To have led\\na convictâ\\x80\\x99s life--to have screwed oneself down to oneâ\\x80\\x99s work--all for a\\nmere delusion! Please notice that itâ\\x80\\x99s quite possible, after all.\\nThere are some consecrated reputations which I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t give a rap for.\\nClassical education has deformed everything, and has imposed upon us as\\ngeniuses men of correct, facile talent, who follow the beaten track.\\nTo them one may prefer men of free tendencies, whose work is at times\\nunequal; but these are only known to a few people of real culture,\\nso that it looks as if immortality might really go merely to the\\nmiddle-class â\\x80\\x9caverageâ\\x80\\x9d talent, to the men whose names are forced into\\nour brains at school, when we are not strong enough to defend ourselves.\\nBut no, no, one mustnâ\\x80\\x99t say those things; they make me shudder! Should I\\nhave the courage to go on with my task, should I be able to remain erect\\namid all the jeering around me if I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t the consoling illusion that I\\nshall some day be appreciated?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude had listened with his dolorous expression, and he now made a\\ngesture of indifference tinged with bitterness.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Bah! what does it matter? Well, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing hereafter. We are even\\nmadder than the fools who kill themselves for a woman. When the earth\\nsplits to pieces in space like a dry walnut, our works wonâ\\x80\\x99t add one\\natom to its dust.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s quite true,â\\x80\\x99 summed up Sandoz, who was very pale. â\\x80\\x98Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nuse of trying to fill up the void of space? And to think that we know\\nit, and that our pride still battles all the same!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey left the restaurant, roamed about the streets, and foundered again\\nin the depths of a cafe, where they philosophised. They had come by\\ndegrees to raking up the memories of their childhood, and this ended\\nby filling their hearts with sadness. One oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning struck\\nwhen they decided to go home.\\n\\nHowever, Sandoz talked of seeing Claude as far as the Rue Tourlaque.\\nThat August night was a superb one, the air was warm, the sky studded\\nwith stars. And as they went the round by way of the Quartier de\\nlâ\\x80\\x99Europe, they passed before the old Cafe Baudequin on the Boulevard des\\nBatignolles. It had changed hands three times. It was no longer arranged\\ninside in the same manner as formerly; there were now a couple of\\nbilliard tables on the right hand; and several strata of customers had\\nfollowed each other thither, one covering the other, so that the old\\nfrequenters had disappeared like buried nations. However, curiosity, the\\nemotion they had derived from all the past things they had been raking\\nup together, induced them to cross the boulevard and to glance into the\\ncafe through the open doorway. They wanted to see their table of yore,\\non the left hand, right at the back of the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, look!â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, stupefied.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Gagniere!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Claude.\\n\\nIt was indeed Gagniere, seated all alone at that table at the end of the\\nempty cafe. He must have come from Melun for one of the Sunday concerts\\nto which he treated himself; and then, in the evening, while astray in\\nParis, an old habit of his legs had led him to the Cafe Baudequin. Not\\none of the comrades ever set foot there now, and he, who had beheld\\nanother age, obstinately remained there alone. He had not yet touched\\nhis glass of beer; he was looking at it, so absorbed in thought that\\nhe did not even stir when the waiters began piling the chairs on\\nthe tables, in order that everything might be ready for the morrowâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsweeping.\\n\\nThe two friends hurried off, upset by the sight of that dim figure,\\nseized as it were with a childish fear of ghosts. They parted in the Rue\\nTourlaque.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! that poor devil Dubuche!â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz as he pressed Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s hand,\\nâ\\x80\\x98he spoilt our day for us.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs soon as November had come round, and when all the old friends were\\nback in Paris again, Sandoz thought of gathering them together at one\\nof those Thursday dinners which had remained a habit with him. They were\\nalways his greatest delight. The sale of his books was increasing, and\\nhe was growing rich; the flat in the Rue de Londres was becoming quite\\nluxurious compared with the little house at Batignolles; but he himself\\nremained immutable. On this occasion, he was anxious, in his good\\nnature, to procure real enjoyment for Claude by organising one of the\\ndear evenings of their youth. So he saw to the invitations; Claude and\\nChristine naturally must come; next Jory and his wife, the latter of\\nwhom it had been necessary to receive since her marriage, then Dubuche,\\nwho always came alone, with Fagerolles, Mahoudeau, and finally Gagniere.\\nThere would be ten of them--all the men comrades of the old band,\\nwithout a single outsider, in order that the good understanding and\\njollity might be complete.\\n\\nHenriette, who was more mistrustful than her husband, hesitated when\\nthis list of guests was decided upon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! Fagerolles? You believe in having Fagerolles with the others? They\\nhardly like him--nor Claude either; I fancied I noticed a coolness--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut he interrupted her, bent on not admitting it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What! a coolness? Itâ\\x80\\x99s really funny, but women canâ\\x80\\x99t understand that\\nfellows chaff each other. All that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t prevent them from having\\ntheir hearts in the right place.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHenriette took especial care in preparing the menu for that Thursday\\ndinner. She now had quite a little staff to overlook, a cook, a\\nman-servant, and so on; and if she no longer prepared any of the dishes\\nherself, she still saw that very delicate fare was provided, out of\\naffection for her husband, whose sole vice was gluttony. She went to\\nmarket with the cook, and called in person on the tradespeople. She\\nand her husband had a taste for gastronomical curiosities from the four\\ncorners of the world. On this occasion they decided to have some ox-tail\\nsoup, grilled mullet, undercut of beef with mushrooms, _raviolis_ in\\nthe Italian fashion, hazel-hens from Russia, and a salad of truffles,\\nwithout counting caviare and _kilkis_ as side-dishes, a _glace\\npralinee_, and a little emerald-coloured Hungarian cheese, with fruit\\nand pastry. As wine, some old Bordeaux claret in decanters, chambertin\\nwith the roast, and sparkling moselle at dessert, in lieu of champagne,\\nwhich was voted commonplace.\\n\\nAt seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock Sandoz and Henriette were waiting for their guests, he\\nsimply wearing a jacket, and she looking very elegant in a plain dress\\nof black satin. People dined at their house in frock-coats, without\\nany fuss. The drawing-room, the arrangements of which they were now\\ncompleting, was becoming crowded with old furniture, old tapestry,\\nnick-nacks of all countries and all times--a rising and now overflowing\\nstream of things which had taken source at Batignolles with an old pot\\nof Rouen ware, which Henriette had given her husband on one of his fete\\ndays. They ran about to the curiosity shops together; a joyful passion\\nfor buying possessed them. Sandoz satisfied the longings of his youth,\\nthe romanticist ambitions which the first books he had read had\\ngiven birth to. Thus this writer, so fiercely modern, lived amid the\\nworm-eaten middle ages which he had dreamt of when he was a lad of\\nfifteen. As an excuse, he laughingly declared that handsome modern\\nfurniture cost too much, whilst with old things, even common ones, you\\nimmediately obtained something with effect and colour. There was nothing\\nof the collector about him, he was entirely concerned as to decoration\\nand broad effects; and to tell the truth, the drawing-room, lighted by\\ntwo lamps of old Delft ware, had quite a soft warm tint with the dull\\ngold of the dalmaticas used for upholstering the seats, the yellowish\\nincrustations of the Italian cabinets and Dutch show-cases, the faded\\nhues of the Oriental door-hangings, the hundred little notes of the\\nivory, crockery and enamel work, pale with age, which showed against the\\ndull red hangings of the room.\\n\\nClaude and Christine were the first to arrive. The latter had put on\\nher only silk dress--an old, worn-out garment which she preserved with\\nespecial care for such occasions. Henriette at once took hold of\\nboth her hands and drew her to a sofa. She was very fond of her, and\\nquestioned her, seeing her so strange, touchingly pale, and with anxious\\neyes. What was the matter? Did she feel poorly? No, no, she answered\\nthat she was very gay and very pleased to come; but while she spoke, she\\nkept on glancing at Claude, as if to study him, and then looked away. He\\nseemed excited, evincing a feverishness in his words and gestures which\\nhe had not shown for a month past. At intervals, however, his agitation\\nsubsided, and he remained silent, with his eyes wide open, gazing\\nvacantly into space at something which he fancied was calling him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! old man,â\\x80\\x99 he said to Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98I finished reading your book last\\nnight. Itâ\\x80\\x99s deucedly clever; you have shut up their mouths this time!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey both talked standing in front of the chimney-piece, where some logs\\nwere blazing. Sandoz had indeed just published a new novel, and although\\nhis critics did not disarm, there was at last that stir of success which\\nestablishes a manâ\\x80\\x99s reputation despite the persistent attacks of his\\nadversaries. Besides, he had no illusions; he knew very well that the\\nbattle, even if it were won, would begin again at each fresh book he\\nwrote. The great work of his life was advancing, that series of novels\\nwhich he launched forth in volumes one after another in stubborn,\\nregular fashion, marching towards the goal he had selected without\\nletting anything, obstacles, insults, or fatigue, conquer him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x99 he gaily replied, â\\x80\\x98they are weakening this time. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\neven one who has been foolish enough to admit that Iâ\\x80\\x99m an honest man!\\nSee how everything degenerates! But theyâ\\x80\\x99ll make up for it, never fear!\\nI know some of them whose nuts are too much unlike my own to let\\nthem accept my literary formula, my boldness of language, and my\\nphysiological characters acting under the influence of circumstances;\\nand I refer to brother writers who possess self-respect; I leave the\\nfools and the scoundrels on one side. For a man to be able to work on\\npluckily, it is best for him to expect neither good faith nor justice.\\nTo be in the right he must begin by dying.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s eyes abruptly turned towards a corner of the\\ndrawing-room, as if to pierce the wall and go far away yonder, whither\\nsomething had summoned him. Then they became hazy and returned from\\ntheir journey, whilst he exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! you speak for yourself! I should do wrong to kick the bucket. No\\nmatter, your book sent me into a deuced fever. I wanted to paint to-day,\\nbut I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t. Ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s lucky that I canâ\\x80\\x99t get jealous of you, else you\\nwould make me too unhappy.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, the door had opened, and Mathilde came in, followed by Jory.\\nShe was richly attired in a tunic of nasturtium-hued velvet and a skirt\\nof straw-coloured satin, with diamonds in her ears and a large bouquet\\nof roses on her bosom. What astonished Claude the most was that he did\\nnot recognise her, for she had become plump, round, and fair skinned,\\ninstead of thin and sunburnt as he had known her. Her disturbing\\nugliness had departed in a swelling of the face; her mouth, once\\nnoted for its black voids, now displayed teeth which looked over-white\\nwhenever she condescended to smile, with a disdainful curling of the\\nupper lip. You could guess that she had become immoderately respectable;\\nher five and forty summers gave her weight beside her husband, who was\\nyounger than herself and seemed to be her nephew. The only thing of yore\\nthat clung to her was a violent perfume; she drenched herself with the\\nstrongest essences, as if she had been anxious to wash from her skin the\\nsmell of all the aromatic simples with which she had been impregnated\\nby her herbalist business; however, the sharpness of rhubarb, the\\nbitterness of elder-seed, and the warmth of peppermint clung to her;\\nand as soon as she crossed the drawing-room, it was filled with an\\nundefinable smell like that of a chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop, relieved by an acute\\nodour of musk.\\n\\nHenriette, who had risen, made her sit down beside Christine, saying:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You know each other, donâ\\x80\\x99t you? You have already met here.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMathilde gave but a cold glance at the modest attire of that woman\\nwho had lived for a long time with a man, so it was said, before being\\nmarried to him. She herself was exceedingly rigid respecting such\\nmatters since the tolerance prevailing in literary and artistic circles\\nhad admitted her to a few drawing-rooms. Henriette hated her, however,\\nand after the customary exchange of courtesies, not to be dispensed\\nwith, resumed her conversation with Christine.\\n\\nJory had shaken hands with Claude and Sandoz, and, standing near them,\\nin front of the fireplace, he apologised for an article slashing the\\nnovelistâ\\x80\\x99s new book which had appeared that very morning in his review.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98As you know very well, my dear fellow, one is never the master in oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nown house. I ought to see to everything, but I have so little time! I\\nhadnâ\\x80\\x99t even read that article, I relied on what had been told me\\nabout it. So you will understand how enraged I was when I read it this\\nafternoon. I am dreadfully grieved, dreadfully grieved--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, let it be! Itâ\\x80\\x99s the natural order of things,â\\x80\\x99 replied Sandoz,\\nquietly. â\\x80\\x98Now that my enemies are beginning to praise me, itâ\\x80\\x99s only\\nproper that my friends should attack me.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe door again opened, and Gagniere glided in softly, like a\\nwill-oâ\\x80\\x99-the-wisp. He had come straight from Melun, and was quite alone,\\nfor he never showed his wife to anybody. When he thus came to dinner he\\nbrought the country dust with him on his boots, and carried it back with\\nhim the same night on taking the last train. On the other hand, he did\\nnot alter; or, rather, age seemed to rejuvenate him; his complexion\\nbecame fairer as he grew old.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! Why, Gagniereâ\\x80\\x99s here!â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Sandoz.\\n\\nThen, just as Gagniere was making up his mind to bow to the ladies,\\nMahoudeau entered. He had already grown grey, with a sunken,\\nfierce-looking face and childish, blinking eyes. He still wore trousers\\nwhich were a good deal too short for him, and a frock-coat which creased\\nin the back, in spite of the money which he now earned; for the bronze\\nmanufacturer for whom he worked had brought out some charming statuettes\\nof his, which one began to see on middle-class mantel-shelves and\\nconsoles.\\n\\nSandoz and Claude had turned round, inquisitive to witness the meeting\\nbetween Mahoudeau and Mathilde. However, matters passed off very\\nquietly. The sculptor bowed to her respectfully, while Jory, the\\nhusband, with his air of serene unconsciousness, thought fit to\\nintroduce her to him, for the twentieth time, perhaps.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Eh! Itâ\\x80\\x99s my wife, old fellow. Shake hands together.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThereupon, both very grave, like people of society who are forced\\nsomewhat over-promptly into familiarity, Mathilde and Mahoudeau shook\\nhands. Only, as soon as the latter had got rid of the job and had found\\nGagniere in a corner of the drawing-room, they both began sneering and\\nrecalling, in terrible language, all the abominations of yore.\\n\\nDubuche was expected that evening, for he had formally promised to come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes,â\\x80\\x99 explained Henriette, â\\x80\\x98there will only be nine of us. Fagerolles\\nwrote this morning to apologise; he is forced to go to some official\\ndinner, but he hopes to escape, and will join us at about eleven\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt that moment, however, a servant came in with a telegram. It was from\\nDubuche, who wired: â\\x80\\x98Impossible to stir. Alice has an alarming cough.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, we shall only be eight, then,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Henriette, with the\\nsomewhat peevish resignation of a hostess disappointed by her guests.\\n\\nAnd the servant having opened the dining-room door and announced that\\ndinner was ready, she added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We are all here. Claude, offer me your arm.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz took Mathildeâ\\x80\\x99s, Jory charged himself with Christine, while\\nMahoudeau and Gagniere brought up the rear, still joking coarsely about\\nwhat they called the beautiful herbalistâ\\x80\\x99s padding.\\n\\nThe dining-room which they now entered was very spacious, and the light\\nwas gaily bright after the subdued illumination of the drawing-room. The\\nwalls, covered with specimens of old earthenware, displayed a gay medley\\nof colours, reminding one of cheap coloured prints. Two sideboards,\\none laden with glass and the other with silver plate, sparkled like\\njewellersâ\\x80\\x99 show-cases. And in the centre of the room, under the\\nbig hanging lamp girt round with tapers, the table glistened like a\\n_catafalque_ with the whiteness of its cloth, laid in perfect style,\\nwith decorated plates, cut-glass decanters white with water or\\nruddy with wine, and symmetrical side-dishes, all set out around the\\ncentre-piece, a silver basket full of purple roses.\\n\\nThey sat down, Henriette between Claude and Mahoudeau, Sandoz with\\nMathilde and Christine beside him, Jory and Gagniere at either end; and\\nthe servant had barely finished serving the soup, when Madame Jory made\\na most unfortunate remark. Wishing to show herself amiable, and not\\nhaving heard her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s apologies, she said to the master of the\\nhouse:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, were you pleased with the article in this morningâ\\x80\\x99s number?\\nEdouard personally revised the proofs with the greatest care!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn hearing this, Jory became very much confused and stammered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no! you are mistaken! It was a very bad article indeed, and you\\nknow very well that it was â\\x80\\x9cpassedâ\\x80\\x9d the other evening while I was away.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBy the silent embarrassment which ensued she guessed her blunder. But\\nshe made matters still worse, for, giving her husband a sharp glance,\\nshe retorted in a very loud voice, so as to crush him, as it were, and\\ndisengage her own responsibility:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Another of your lies! I repeat what you told me. I wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow you to\\nmake me ridiculous, do you hear?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis threw a chill over the beginning of the dinner. Henriette\\nrecommended the _kilkis_, but Christine alone found them very nice.\\nWhen the grilled mullet appeared, Sandoz, who was amused by Joryâ\\x80\\x99s\\nembarrassment, gaily reminded him of a lunch they had had together at\\nMarseilles in the old days. Ah! Marseilles, the only city where people\\nknow how to eat!\\n\\nClaude, who for a little while had been absorbed in thought, now seemed\\nto awaken from a dream, and without any transition he asked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Is it decided? Have they selected the artists for the new decorations\\nof the Hotel de Ville?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No,â\\x80\\x99 said Mahoudeau, â\\x80\\x98they are going to do so. I shaâ\\x80\\x99nâ\\x80\\x99t get anything,\\nfor I donâ\\x80\\x99t know anybody. Fagerolles himself is very anxious. If he\\nisnâ\\x80\\x99t here to-night, itâ\\x80\\x99s because matters are not going smoothly. Ah!\\nhe has had his bite at the cherry; all that painting for millions is\\ncracking to bits!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a laugh, expressive of spite finally satisfied, and even\\nGagniere at the other end of the table joined in the sneering. Then they\\neased their feelings in malicious words, and rejoiced over the sudden\\nfall of prices which had thrown the world of â\\x80\\x98young mastersâ\\x80\\x99 into\\nconsternation. It was inevitable, the predicted time was coming,\\nthe exaggerated rise was about to finish in a catastrophe. Since the\\namateurs had been panic-stricken, seized with consternation like that\\nof speculators when a â\\x80\\x98slumpâ\\x80\\x99 sweeps over a Stock Exchange, prices were\\ngiving way day by day, and nothing more was sold. It was a sight to\\nsee the famous Naudet amid the rout; he had held out at first, he had\\ninvented â\\x80\\x98the dodge of the Yankeeâ\\x80\\x99--the unique picture hidden deep in\\nsome gallery, in solitude like an idol--the picture of which he would\\nnot name the price, being contemptuously certain that he could never\\nfind a man rich enough to purchase it, but which he finally sold for two\\nor three hundred thousand francs to some pig-dealer of Chicago, who\\nfelt glorious at carrying off the most expensive canvas of the year. But\\nthose fine strokes of business were not to be renewed at present, and\\nNaudet, whose expenditure had increased with his gains, drawn on and\\nswallowed up in the mad craze which was his own work, could now hear\\nhis regal mansion crumbling beneath him, and was reduced to defend it\\nagainst the assault of creditors.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Wonâ\\x80\\x99t you take some more mushrooms, Mahoudeau?â\\x80\\x99 obligingly interrupted\\nHenriette.\\n\\nThe servant was now handing round the undercut. They ate, and emptied\\nthe decanters; but their bitterness was so great that the best things\\nwere offered without being tasted, which distressed the master and\\nmistress of the house.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Mushrooms, eh?â\\x80\\x99 the sculptor ended by repeating. â\\x80\\x98No, thanks.â\\x80\\x99 And he\\nadded: â\\x80\\x98The funny part of it all is, that Naudet is suing Fagerolles.\\nOh, quite so! heâ\\x80\\x99s going to distrain on him. Ah! it makes me laugh! We\\nshall see a pretty scouring in the Avenue de Villiers among all those\\npetty painters with mansions of their own. House property will go for\\nnothing next spring! Well, Naudet, who had compelled Fagerolles to build\\na house, and who furnished it for him as he would have furnished a place\\nfor a hussy, wanted to get hold of his nick-nacks and hangings again.\\nBut Fagerolles had borrowed money on them, so it seems. You can imagine\\nthe state of affairs; the dealer accuses the artist of having spoilt his\\ngame by exhibiting with the vanity of a giddy fool; while the painter\\nreplies that he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be robbed any longer; and theyâ\\x80\\x99ll end by\\ndevouring each other--at least, I hope so.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere raised his voice, the gentle but inexorable voice of a dreamer\\njust awakened.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Fagerolles is done for. Besides, he never had any success.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe others protested. Well, what about the hundred thousand francsâ\\x80\\x99\\nworth of pictures he had sold a year, and his medals and his cross\\nof the Legion of Honour? But Gagniere, still obstinate, smiled with\\na mysterious air, as if facts could not prevail against his inner\\nconviction. He wagged his head and, full of disdain, replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Let me be! He never knew anything about chiaroscuro.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJory was about to defend the talent of Fagerolles, whom he considered to\\nbe his own creation, when Henriette solicited a little attention for\\nthe _raviolis_. There was a short slackening of the quarrel amid the\\ncrystalline clinking of the glasses and the light clatter of the forks.\\nThe table, laid with such fine symmetry, was already in confusion, and\\nseemed to sparkle still more amid the ardent fire of the quarrel. And\\nSandoz, growing anxious, felt astonished. What was the matter with them\\nall that they attacked Fagerolles so harshly? Hadnâ\\x80\\x99t they all begun\\ntogether, and were they not all to reach the goal in the same victory?\\nFor the first time, a feeling of uneasiness disturbed his dream of\\neternity, that delight in his Thursdays, which he had pictured following\\none upon another, all alike, all of them happy ones, into the far\\ndistance of the future. But the feeling was as yet only skin deep, and\\nhe laughingly exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Husband your strength, Claude, here are the hazel-hens. Eh! Claude,\\nwhere are you?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSince silence had prevailed, Claude had relapsed into his dream, gazing\\nabout him vacantly, and taking a second help of _raviolis_ without\\nknowing what he was about; Christine, who said nothing, but sat there\\nlooking sad and charming, did not take her eyes off him. He started when\\nSandoz spoke, and chose a leg from amid the bits of hazel-hen now being\\nserved, the strong fumes of which filled the room with a resinous smell.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Do you smell that?â\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Sandoz, amused; â\\x80\\x98one would think one were\\nswallowing all the forests of Russia.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Claude returned to the matter which worried him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Then you say that Fagerolles will be entrusted with the paintings for\\nthe Municipal Councilâ\\x80\\x99s assembly room?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd this remark sufficed; Mahoudeau and Gagniere, set on the track, at\\nonce started off again. Ah! a nice wishy-washy smearing it would be\\nif that assembly room were allotted to him; and he was doing plenty of\\ndirty things to get it. He, who had formerly pretended to spit on\\norders for work, like a great artist surrounded by amateurs, was basely\\ncringing to the officials, now that his pictures no longer sold.\\nCould anything more despicable be imagined than a painter soliciting\\na functionary, bowing and scraping, showing all kinds of cowardice and\\nmaking all kinds of concessions? It was shameful that art should be\\ndependent upon a Ministerâ\\x80\\x99s idiotic good pleasure! Fagerolles, at that\\nofficial dinner he had gone to, was no doubt conscientiously licking the\\nboots of some chief clerk, some idiot who was only fit to be made a guy\\nof.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well,â\\x80\\x99 said Jory, â\\x80\\x98he effects his purpose, and heâ\\x80\\x99s quite right. _You_\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t pay his debts.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Debts? Have I any debts, I who have always starved?â\\x80\\x99 answered Mahoudeau\\nin a roughly arrogant tone. â\\x80\\x98Ought a fellow to build himself a palace\\nand spend money on creatures like that Irma Becot, whoâ\\x80\\x99s ruining\\nFagerolles?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this Jory grew angry, while the others jested, and Irmaâ\\x80\\x99s name went\\nflying over the table. But Mathilde, who had so far remained reserved\\nand silent by way of making a show of good breeding, became intensely\\nindignant. â\\x80\\x98Oh! gentlemen, oh! gentlemen,â\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed, â\\x80\\x98to talk\\nbefore _us_ about that creature. No, not that creature, I implore you!\\n\\nAfter that Henriette and Sandoz, who were in consternation, witnessed\\nthe rout of their menu. The truffle salad, the ice, the dessert,\\neverything was swallowed without being at all appreciated amidst the\\nrising anger of the quarrel; and the chambertin and sparkling moselle\\nwere imbibed as if they had merely been water. In vain did Henriette\\nsmile, while Sandoz good-naturedly tried to calm them by making\\nallowances for human weakness. Not one of them retreated from his\\nposition; a single word made them spring upon each other. There was\\nnone of the vague boredom, the somniferous satiety which at times had\\nsaddened their old gatherings; at present there was real ferocity in the\\nstruggle, a longing to destroy one another. The tapers of the hanging\\nlamp flared up, the painted flowers of the earthenware on the walls\\nbloomed, the table seemed to have caught fire amid the upsetting of its\\nsymmetrical arrangements and the violence of the talk, that demolishing\\nonslaught of chatter which had filled them with fever for a couple of\\nhours past.\\n\\nAnd amid the racket, when Henriette made up her mind to rise so as to\\nsilence them, Claude at length remarked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! if I only had the Hotel de Ville work, and if I could! It used to\\nbe my dream to cover all the walls of Paris!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey returned to the drawing-room, where the little chandelier and the\\nbracket-candelabra had just been lighted. It seemed almost cold there in\\ncomparison with the kind of hot-house which had just been left; and\\nfor a moment the coffee calmed the guests. Nobody beyond Fagerolles was\\nexpected. The house was not an open one by any means, the Sandozes\\ndid not recruit literary dependents or muzzle the press by dint of\\ninvitations. The wife detested society, and the husband said with a\\nlaugh that he needed ten years to take a liking to anybody, and then he\\nmust like him always. But was not that real happiness, seldom realised?\\nA few sound friendships and a nook full of family affection. No\\nmusic was ever played there, and nobody had ever read a page of his\\ncomposition aloud.\\n\\nOn that particular Thursday the evening seemed a long one, on account\\nof the persistent irritation of the men. The ladies had begun to chat\\nbefore the smouldering fire; and when the servant, after clearing the\\ntable, reopened the door of the dining-room, they were left alone, the\\nmen repairing to the adjoining apartment to smoke and sip some beer.\\n\\nSandoz and Claude, who were not smokers, soon returned, however, and sat\\ndown, side by side, on a sofa near the doorway. The former, who was glad\\nto see his old friend excited and talkative, recalled the memories\\nof Plassans apropos of a bit of news he had learnt the previous day.\\nPouillaud, the old jester of their dormitory, who had become so grave\\na lawyer, was now in trouble over some adventure with a woman. Ah! that\\nbrute of a Pouillaud! But Claude did not answer, for, having heard his\\nname mentioned in the dining-room, he listened attentively, trying to\\nunderstand.\\n\\nJory, Mahoudeau, and Gagniere, unsatiated and eager for another bite,\\nhad started on the massacre again. Their voices, at first mere whispers,\\ngradually grew louder, till at last they began to shout.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! the man, I abandon the man to you,â\\x80\\x99 said Jory, who was speaking of\\nFagerolles. â\\x80\\x98He isnâ\\x80\\x99t worth much. And he out-generalled you, itâ\\x80\\x99s true.\\nAh! how he did get the better of you fellows, by breaking off from you\\nand carving success for himself on your backs! You were certainly not at\\nall cute.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nMahoudeau, waxing furious, replied:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Of course! It sufficed for us to be with Claude, to be turned away\\neverywhere.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It was Claude who did for us!â\\x80\\x99 so Gagniere squarely asserted.\\n\\nAnd thus they went on, relinquishing Fagerolles, whom they reproached\\nfor toadying the newspapers, for allying himself with their enemies and\\nwheedling sexagenarian baronesses, to fall upon Claude, who now became\\nthe great culprit. Well, after all, the other was only a hussy, one of\\nthe many found in the artistic fraternity, fellows who accost the public\\nat street corners, leave their comrades in the lurch, and victimise them\\nso as to get the bourgeois into their studios. But Claude, that abortive\\ngreat artist, that impotent fellow who couldnâ\\x80\\x99t set a figure on its legs\\nin spite of all his pride, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he utterly compromised them, hadnâ\\x80\\x99t he\\nlet them in altogether? Ah! yes, success might have been won by breaking\\noff. If they had been able to begin over again, they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been\\nidiots enough to cling obstinately to impossible principles! And they\\naccused Claude of having paralysed them, of having traded on them--yes,\\ntraded on them, but in so clumsy and dull-witted a manner that he\\nhimself had not derived any benefit by it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why, as for me,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Mahoudeau, â\\x80\\x98didnâ\\x80\\x99t he make me quite idiotic at\\none moment? When I think of it, I sound myself, and remain wondering\\nwhy I ever joined his band. Am I at all like him? Was there ever any one\\nthing in common between us, eh? Ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s exasperating to find the truth\\nout so late in the day!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And as for myself,â\\x80\\x99 said Gagniere, â\\x80\\x98he robbed me of my originality. Do\\nyou think it has amused me, each time I have exhibited a painting during\\nthe last fifteen years, to hear people saying behind me, â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nClaude!â\\x80\\x9d Oh! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough of it, I prefer not to paint any more.\\nAll the same, if I had seen clearly in former times, I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have\\nassociated with him.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was a stampede, the snapping of the last ties, in their stupefaction\\nat suddenly finding that they were strangers and enemies, after a long\\nyouth of fraternity together. Life had disbanded them on the road, and\\nthe great dissimilarity of their characters stood revealed; all that\\nremained in them was the bitterness left by the old enthusiastic dream,\\nthat erstwhile hope of battle and victory to be won side by side, which\\nnow increased their spite.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98The fact is,â\\x80\\x99 sneered Jory, â\\x80\\x98that Fagerolles did not let himself be\\npillaged like a simpleton.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Mahoudeau, feeling vexed, became angry. â\\x80\\x98You do wrong to laugh,â\\x80\\x99 he\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x98for you are a nice backslider yourself. Yes, you always told us\\nthat you would give us a lift up when you had a paper of your own.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! allow me, allow me--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nGagniere, however, united with Mahoudeau: â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s quite true!â\\x80\\x99 he said.\\nâ\\x80\\x98You canâ\\x80\\x99t say any more that what you write about us is cut out, for you\\nare the master now. And yet, never a word! You didnâ\\x80\\x99t even name us in\\nyour articles on the last Salon.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen Jory, embarrassed and stammering, in his turn flew into a rage.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! well, itâ\\x80\\x99s the fault of that cursed Claude! I donâ\\x80\\x99t care to lose my\\nsubscribers simply to please you fellows. Itâ\\x80\\x99s impossible to do anything\\nfor you! There! do you understand? You, Mahoudeau, may wear yourself\\nout in producing pretty little things; you, Gagniere, may even never do\\nanything more; but you each have a label on the back, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll need\\nten yearsâ\\x80\\x99 efforts before youâ\\x80\\x99ll be able to get it off. In fact, there\\nhave been some labels that would never come off! The public is amused\\nby it, you know; there were only you fellows to believe in the genius of\\nthat big ridiculous lunatic, who will be locked up in a madhouse one of\\nthese fine mornings!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen the dispute became terrible, they all three spoke at once, coming\\nat last to abominable reproaches, with such outbursts, and such furious\\nmotion of the jaw, that they seemed to be biting one another.\\n\\nSandoz, seated on the sofa, and disturbed in the gay memories he was\\nrecalling, was at last obliged to lend ear to the tumult which reached\\nhim through the open doorway.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You hear them?â\\x80\\x99 whispered Claude, with a dolorous smile; â\\x80\\x98they are\\ngiving it me nicely! No, no, stay here, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t let you stop them; I\\ndeserve it, since I have failed to succeed.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd Sandoz, turning pale, remained there, listening to that bitter\\nquarrelling, the outcome of the struggle for life, that grappling of\\nconflicting personalities, which bore all his chimera of everlasting\\nfriendship away.\\n\\nHenriette, fortunately, became anxious on hearing the violent shouting.\\nShe rose and went to shame the smokers for thus forsaking the ladies\\nto go and quarrel together. They then returned to the drawing-room,\\nperspiring, breathing hard, and still shaken by their anger. And as\\nHenriette, with her eyes on the clock, remarked that they certainly\\nwould not see Fagerolles that evening, they, began to sneer again,\\nexchanging glances. Ah! he had a fine scent, and no mistake; he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nbe caught associating with old friends, who had become troublesome, and\\nwhom he hated.\\n\\nIn fact, Fagerolles did not come. The evening finished laboriously. They\\nonce more went back to the dining-room, where the tea was served on a\\nRussian tablecloth embroidered with a stag-hunt in red thread; and under\\nthe tapers a plain cake was displayed, with plates full of sweetstuff\\nand pastry, and a barbarous collection of liqueurs and spirits, whisky,\\nhollands, Chio raki, and kummel. The servant also brought some punch,\\nand bestirred himself round the table, while the mistress of the house\\nfilled the teapot from the samovar boiling in front of her. But all the\\ncomfort, all the feast for the eyes and the fine perfume of the tea did\\nnot move their hearts. The conversation again turned on the success that\\nsome men achieved and the ill-luck that befell others. For instance, was\\nit not shameful that art should be dishonoured by all those medals, all\\nthose crosses, all those rewards, which were so badly distributed to\\nboot? Were artists always to remain like little boys at school? All\\nthe universal platitude came from the docility and cowardice which were\\nshown, as in the presence of ushers, so as to obtain good marks.\\n\\nThey had repaired to the drawing-room once more, and Sandoz, who was\\ngreatly distressed, had begun to wish that they would take themselves\\noff, when he noticed Mathilde and Gagniere seated side by side on a sofa\\nand talking languishingly of music, while the others remained exhausted,\\nlacking saliva and power of speech. Gagniere philosophised and poetised\\nin a state of ecstasy, while Mathilde rolled up her eyes and went into\\nraptures as if titillated by some invisible wing. They had caught sight\\nof each other on the previous Sunday at the concert at the Cirque, and\\nthey apprised each other of their enjoyment in alternate, far-soaring\\nsentences.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! that Meyerbeer, monsieur, the overture of â\\x80\\x9cStruensee,â\\x80\\x9d that\\nfunereal strain, and then that peasant dance, so full of dash and\\ncolour; and then the mournful burden which returns, the duo of the\\nvioloncellos. Ah! monsieur, the violoncellos, the violoncellos!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And Berlioz, madame, the festival air in â\\x80\\x9cRomeo.â\\x80\\x9d Oh! the solo of the\\nclarionets, the beloved women, with the harp accompaniment! Something\\nenrapturing, something white as snow which ascends! The festival\\nbursts upon you, like a picture by Paul Veronese, with the tumultuous\\nmagnificence of the â\\x80\\x9cMarriage of Canaâ\\x80\\x9d; and then the love-song begins\\nagain, oh, how softly! Oh! always higher! higher still--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Did you notice, monsieur, in Beethovenâ\\x80\\x99s Symphony in A, that knell\\nwhich ever and ever comes back and beats upon your heart? Yes, I see\\nvery well, you feel as I do, music is a communion--Beethoven, ah, me!\\nhow sad and sweet it is to be two to understand him and give way--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And Schumann, madame, and Wagner, madame--Schumannâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cReverie,â\\x80\\x9d nothing\\nbut the stringed instruments, a warm shower falling on acacia leaves, a\\nsunray which dries them, barely a tear in space. Wagner! ah, Wagner! the\\noverture of the â\\x80\\x9cFlying Dutchman,â\\x80\\x9d are you not fond of it?--tell me you\\nare fond of it! As for myself, it overcomes me. There is nothing left,\\nnothing left, one expires--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nTheir voices died away; they did not even look at each other, but sat\\nthere elbow to elbow, with their faces turned upward, quite overcome.\\n\\nSandoz, who was surprised, asked himself where Mathilde could have\\npicked up that jargon. In some article of Joryâ\\x80\\x99s, perhaps. Besides, he\\nhad remarked that women talk music very well, even without knowing a\\nnote of it. And he, whom the bitterness of the others had only grieved,\\nbecame exasperated at sight of Mathildeâ\\x80\\x99s languishing attitude. No, no,\\nthat was quite enough; the men tore each other to bits; still that might\\npass, after all; but what an end to the evening it was, that feminine\\nfraud, cooing and titillating herself with thoughts of Beethovenâ\\x80\\x99s and\\nSchumannâ\\x80\\x99s music! Fortunately, Gagniere suddenly rose. He knew what\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock it was even in the depths of his ecstasy, and he had only just\\ntime left him to catch his last train. So, after exchanging nerveless\\nand silent handshakes with the others, he went off to sleep at Melun.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What a failure he is!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Mahoudeau. â\\x80\\x98Music has killed painting;\\nheâ\\x80\\x99ll never do anything!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe himself had to leave, and the door had scarcely closed behind his\\nback when Jory declared:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Have you seen his last paperweight? Heâ\\x80\\x99ll end by sculpturing\\nsleeve-links. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fellow who has missed his mark! To think that he\\nprided himself on being vigorous!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut Mathilde was already afoot, taking leave of Christine with a curt\\nlittle inclination of the head, affecting social familiarity with\\nHenriette, and carrying off her husband, who helped her on with her\\ncloak in the ante-room, humble and terrified at the severe glance she\\ngave him, for she had an account to settle.\\n\\nThen, the door having closed behind them, Sandoz, beside himself,\\ncried out: â\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the end! The journalist was bound to call the others\\nabortions--yes, the journalist who, after patching up articles, has\\nfallen to trading upon public credulity! Ah! luckily thereâ\\x80\\x99s Mathilde\\nthe Avengeress!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOf the guests Christine and Claude alone were left. The latter, since\\nthe drawing-room had been growing empty, had remained ensconced in the\\ndepths of an arm-chair, no longer speaking, but overcome by that species\\nof magnetic slumber which stiffened him, and fixed his eyes on something\\nfar away beyond the walls. He protruded his face, a convulsive kind\\nof attention seemed to carry it forward; he certainly beheld something\\ninvisible, and heard a summons in the silence.\\n\\nChristine having risen in her turn, and apologised for being the last\\nto leave, Henriette took hold of her hands, repeated how fond she was of\\nher, begged her to come and see her frequently, and to dispose of her\\nin all things as she would with a sister. But Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s sorrowful wife,\\nlooking so sadly charming in her black dress, shook her head with a pale\\nsmile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz in her ear, after giving a glance at Claude, â\\x80\\x98you\\nmustnâ\\x80\\x99t distress yourself like that. He has talked a great deal, he has\\nbeen gayer this evening. Heâ\\x80\\x99s all right.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut in a terrified voice she answered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, no; look at his eyes--I shall tremble as long as he has his eyes\\nlike that. You have done all you could, thanks. What you havenâ\\x80\\x99t done no\\none will do. Ah! how I suffer at being unable to hope, at being unable\\nto do anything!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen in a loud tone she asked:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Are you coming, Claude?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had to repeat her question twice, for at first he did not hear her;\\nhe ended by starting, however, and rose to his feet, saying, as if he\\nhad answered the summons from the horizon afar off:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming, Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhen Sandoz and his wife at last found themselves alone in the\\ndrawing-room, where the atmosphere now was stifling--heated by the\\nlights and heavy, as it were, with melancholy silence after all the\\noutbursts of the quarrelling--they looked at one another and let their\\narms fall, quite heart-rent by the unfortunate issue of their dinner\\nparty. Henrietta tried to laugh it off, however, murmuring:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I warned you, I quite understood--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut he interrupted her with a despairing gesture. What! was that, then,\\nthe end of his long illusion, that dream of eternity which had made\\nhim set happiness in a few friendships, formed in childhood, and shared\\nuntil extreme old age? Ah! what a wretched band, what a final rending,\\nwhat a terrible balance-sheet to weep over after that bankruptcy of the\\nhuman heart! And he grew astonished on thinking of the friends who had\\nfallen off by the roadside, of the great affections lost on the way,\\nof the others unceasingly changing around himself, in whom he found no\\nchange. His poor Thursdays filled him with pity, so many memories were\\nin mourning, it was the slow death of all that one loves! Would his\\nwife and himself have to resign themselves to live as in a desert, to\\ncloister themselves in utter hatred of the world? Ought they rather to\\nthrow their doors wide open to a throng of strangers and indifferent\\nfolk? By degrees a certainty dawned in the depths of his grief:\\neverything ended and nothing began again in life. He seemed to yield to\\nevidence, and, heaving a big sigh, exclaimed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You were right. We wonâ\\x80\\x99t invite them to dinner again--they would devour\\none another.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs soon as Claude and Christine reached the Place de la Trinite on their\\nway home, the painter let go of his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s arm; and, stammering that\\nhe had to go somewhere, he begged her to return to the Rue Tourlaque\\nwithout him. She had felt him shuddering, and she remained quite scared\\nwith surprise and fear. Somewhere to go at that hour--past midnight!\\nWhere had he to go, and what for? He had turned round and was making\\noff, when she overtook him, and, pretending that she was frightened,\\nbegged that he would not leave her to climb up to Montmartre alone at\\nthat time of night. This consideration alone brought him back. He took\\nher arm again; they ascended the Rue Blanche and the Rue Lepic, and at\\nlast found themselves in the Rue Tourlaque. And on reaching their door,\\nhe rang the bell, and then again left her.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Here you are,â\\x80\\x99 he said; â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m going.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe was already hastening away, taking long strides, and gesticulating\\nlike a madman. Without even closing the door which had been opened, she\\ndarted off, bent on following him. In the Rue Lepic she drew near; but\\nfor fear of exciting him still more she contented herself with keeping\\nhim in sight, walking some thirty yards in the rear, without his knowing\\nthat she was behind him. On reaching the end of the Rue Lepic he went\\ndown the Rue Blanche again, and then proceeded by way of the Rue de\\nla Chaussee-dâ\\x80\\x99Antin and the Rue du Dix Decembre as far as the Rue de\\nRichelieu. When she saw him turn into the last-named thoroughfare, a\\nmortal chill came over her: he was going towards the Seine; it was the\\nrealisation of the frightful fear which kept her of a night awake, full\\nof anguish! And what could she do, good Lord? Go with him, hang upon his\\nneck over yonder? She was now only able to stagger along, and as each\\nstep brought them nearer to the river, she felt life ebbing from her\\nlimbs. Yes, he was going straight there; he crossed the Place du\\nTheatre Francais, then the Carrousel, and finally reached the Pont des\\nSaints-Peres. After taking a few steps along the bridge, he approached\\nthe railing overlooking the water; and at the thought that he was about\\nto jump over, a loud cry was stifled in her contracted throat.\\n\\nBut no; he remained motionless. Was it then only the Cite over yonder\\nthat haunted him, that heart of Paris which pursued him everywhere,\\nwhich he conjured up with his fixed eyes, even through walls, and which,\\nwhen he was leagues away, cried out the constant summons heard by him\\nalone? She did not yet dare to hope it; she had stopped short, in the\\nrear, watching him with giddy anxiety, ever fancying that she saw him\\ntake the terrible leap, but resisting her longing to draw nearer, for\\nfear lest she might precipitate the catastrophe by showing herself.\\nOh, God! to think that she was there with her devouring passion, her\\nbleeding motherly heart--that she was there beholding everything,\\nwithout daring to risk one movement to hold him back!\\n\\nHe stood erect, looking very tall, quite motionless, and gazing into the\\nnight.\\n\\nIt was a winterâ\\x80\\x99s night, with a misty sky of sooty blackness, and was\\nrendered extremely cold by a sharp wind blowing from the west. Paris,\\nlighted up, had gone to sleep, showing no signs of life save such as\\nattached to the gas-jets, those specks which scintillated and grew\\nsmaller and smaller in the distance till they seemed but so much starry\\ndust. The quays stretched away showing double rows of those luminous\\nbeads whose reverberation glimmered on the nearer frontages. On the left\\nwere the houses of the Quai du Louvre, on the right the two wings of the\\nInstitute, confused masses of monuments and buildings, which became lost\\nto view in the darkening gloom, studded with sparks. Then between those\\ncordons of burners, extending as far as the eye could reach, the bridges\\nstretched bars of lights, ever slighter and slighter, each formed of a\\ntrain of spangles, grouped together and seemingly hanging in mid-air.\\nAnd in the Seine there shone the nocturnal splendour of the animated\\nwater of cities; each gas-jet there cast a reflection of its flame, like\\nthe nucleus of a comet, extending into a tail. The nearer ones, mingling\\ntogether, set the current on fire with broad, regular, symmetrical fans\\nof light, glowing like live embers, while the more distant ones, seen\\nunder the bridges, were but little motionless sparks of fire. But the\\nlarge burning tails appeared to be animated, they waggled as they spread\\nout, all black and gold, with a constant twirling of scales, in which\\none divined the flow of the water. The whole Seine was lighted up by\\nthem, as if some fete were being given in its depths--some mysterious,\\nfairy-like entertainment, at which couples were waltzing beneath the\\nriverâ\\x80\\x99s red-flashing window-panes. High above those fires, above the\\nstarry quays, the sky, in which not a planet was visible, showed a ruddy\\nmass of vapour, that warm, phosphorescent exhalation which every night,\\nabove the sleep of the city, seems to set the crater of a volcano.\\n\\nThe wind blew hard, and Christine, shivering, her eyes full of tears,\\nfelt the bridge move under her, as if it were bearing her away amid a\\nsmash up of the whole scene. Had not Claude moved? Was he not climbing\\nover the rail? No; everything became motionless again, and she saw him\\nstill on the same spot, obstinately stiff, with his eyes turned towards\\nthe point of the Cite, which he could not see.\\n\\nIt had summoned him, and he had come, and yet he could not see it in\\nthe depths of the darkness. He could only distinguish the bridges, with\\ntheir light framework standing out blackly against the sparkling water.\\nBut farther off everything became confused, the island had disappeared,\\nhe could not even have told its exact situation if some belated cabs\\nhad not passed from time to time over the Pont-Neuf, with their lamps\\nshowing like those shooting sparks which dart at times through embers.\\nA red lantern, on a level with the dam of the Mint, cast a streamlet of\\nblood, as it were, into the water. Something huge and lugubrious, some\\ndrifting form, no doubt a lighter which had become unmoored, slowly\\ndescended the stream amid the reflections. Espied for a moment, it was\\nimmediately afterwards lost in the darkness. Where had the triumphal\\nisland sunk? In the depths of that flow of water? Claude still gazed,\\ngradually fascinated by the great rushing of the river in the night. He\\nleant over its broad bed, chilly like an abyss, in which the mysterious\\nflames were dancing. And the loud, sad wail of the current attracted\\nhim, and he listened to its call, despairing, unto death.\\n\\nBy a shooting pain at her heart, Christine this time realised that the\\nterrible thought had just occurred to him. She held out her quivering\\nhands which the wind was lashing. But Claude remained there, struggling\\nagainst the sweetness of death; indeed he did not move for another hour,\\nhe lingered there unconscious of the lapse of time, with his eyes still\\nturned in the direction of the Cite, as if by a miracle of power they\\nwere about to create light, and conjure up the island so that he might\\nbehold it.\\n\\nWhen Claude at last left the bridge, with stumbling steps, Christine had\\nto pass in front and run in order to be home in the Rue Tourlaque before\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\nIT was nearly three oâ\\x80\\x99clock when they went to bed that night, with the\\nbitter cold November wind blowing through their little room and the big\\nstudio. Christine, breathless from her run, had quickly slipped between\\nthe sheets so that he might not know that she had followed him; and\\nClaude, quite overcome, had taken his clothes off, one garment after\\nanother, without saying a word. For long months they had been as\\nstrangers; until then, however, she had never felt such a barrier\\nbetween them, such tomb-like coldness.\\n\\nShe struggled for nearly a quarter of an hour against the sleepiness\\ncoming over her. She was very tired, and a kind of torpor numbed her;\\nstill she would not give way, feeling anxious at leaving him awake. She\\nthus waited every night until he dozed off, so that she herself might\\nafterwards sleep in peace. But he had not extinguished the candle, he\\nlay there with his eyes open, fixed upon its flame. What could he be\\nthinking of? Had he remained in fancy over yonder in the black night,\\namid the moist atmosphere of the quays, in front of Paris studded with\\nstars like a frosty sky? And what inner conflict, what matter that had\\nto be decided, contracted his face like that? Then, resistance being\\nimpossible, she succumbed and glided into the slumber following upon\\ngreat weariness.\\n\\nAn hour later, the consciousness of something missing, the anguish\\nof uneasiness awoke her with a sudden start. She at once felt the bed\\nbeside her, it was already cold: he was no longer there, she had already\\ndivined it while asleep. And she was growing alarmed, still but half\\nawake, her head heavy and her ears buzzing, when through the doorway,\\nleft ajar, she perceived a ray of light coming from the studio. She then\\nfelt reassured, she thought that in a fit of sleeplessness he had gone\\nto fetch some book or other; but at last, as he did not return, she\\nended by softly rising so as to take a peep. What she beheld quite\\nunsettled her, and kept her standing on the tiled floor, with her feet\\nbare, in such surprise that she did not at first dare to show herself.\\n\\nClaude, who was in his shirt-sleeves, despite the coldness of the\\ntemperature, having merely put on his trousers and slippers in his\\nhaste, was standing on the steps in front of his large picture. His\\npalette was lying at his feet, and with one hand he held the candle,\\nwhile with the other he painted. His eyes were dilated like those of\\na somnambulist, his gestures were precise and stiff; he stooped every\\nminute to take some colour on his brush, and then rose up, casting a\\nlarge fantastic shadow on the wall. And there was not a sound; frightful\\nsilence reigned in the big dim room.\\n\\nChristine guessed the truth and shuddered. The besetting worry,\\nmade more acute by that hour spent on the Pont des Saints-Peres, had\\nprevented him from sleeping and had brought him once more before his\\ncanvas, consumed with a longing to look at it again, in spite of the\\nlateness of the hour. He had, no doubt, only climbed the steps to fill\\nhis eyes the nearer. Then, tortured by the sight of some faulty shade,\\nupset by some defect, to such a point that he could not wait for\\ndaylight, he had caught up a brush, at first merely wishing to give\\na simple touch, and then had been carried on from correction to\\ncorrection, until at last, with the candle in his hand, he painted there\\nlike a man in a state of hallucination, amid the pale light which darted\\nhither and thither as he gesticulated. His powerless creative rage had\\nseized hold of him again, he was wearing himself out, oblivious of the\\nhour, oblivious of the world; he wished to infuse life into his work at\\nonce.\\n\\nAh, what a pitiful sight! And with what tear-drenched eyes did Christine\\ngaze at him! At first she thought of leaving him to that mad work, as a\\nmaniac is left to the pleasures of his craziness. He would never finish\\nthat picture, that was quite certain now. The more desperately he worked\\nat it, the more incoherent did it become; the colouring had grown heavy\\nand pasty, the drawing was losing shape and showing signs of effort.\\nEven the background and the group of labourers, once so substantial\\nand satisfactory, were getting spoiled; yet he clung to them, he had\\nobstinately determined to finish everything else before repainting the\\ncentral figure, the nude woman, which remained the dread and the desire\\nof his hours of toil, and which would finish him off whenever he might\\nagain try to invest it with life. For months he had not touched it,\\nand this had tranquillised Christine and made her tolerant and\\ncompassionate, amid her jealous spite; for as long as he did not return\\nto that feared and desired mistress, she thought that he betrayed her\\nless.\\n\\nHer feet were freezing on the tiles, and she was turning to get into bed\\nagain when a shock brought her back to the door. She had not understood\\nat first, but now at last she saw. With broad curved strokes of his\\nbrush, full of colour, Claude was at once wildly and caressingly\\nmodelling flesh. He had a fixed grin on his lips, and did not feel\\nthe burning candle-grease falling on his fingers, while with silent,\\npassionate see-sawing, his right arm alone moved against the wall,\\ncasting black confusion upon it. He was working at the nude woman.\\n\\nThen Christine opened the door and walked into the studio. An invincible\\nrevolt, the anger of a wife buffeted at home, impelled her forward. Yes,\\nhe was with that other, he was painting her like a visionary, whom wild\\ncraving for truth had brought to the madness of the unreal; and those\\nlimbs were being gilded like the columns of a tabernacle, that trunk was\\nbecoming a star, shimmering with yellow and red, splendid and unnatural.\\nSuch strange nudity--like unto a monstrance gleaming with precious\\nstones and intended for religious adoration--brought her anger to a\\nclimax. She had suffered too much, she would not tolerate it.\\n\\nAnd yet at first she simply showed herself despairing and supplicating.\\nIt was but the mother remonstrating with her big mad boy of an artist\\nthat spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What are you doing there, Claude? Is it reasonable, Claude, to have\\nsuch ideas? Come to bed, I beg of you, donâ\\x80\\x99t stay on those steps where\\nyou will catch your death of cold!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe did not answer; he stooped again to take some more paint on his\\nbrush, and made the figure flash with two bright strokes of vermilion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen to me, Claude, in pity come to me--you know that I love you--you\\nsee how anxious you have made me. Come, oh! come, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t want me\\nto die of cold and waiting for you.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWith his face haggard, he did not look at her; but while he bedecked a\\npart of the figure with carmine, he grumbled in a husky voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just leave me alone, will you? Iâ\\x80\\x99m working.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nChristine remained silent for a moment. She was drawing herself erect,\\nher eyes began to gleam with fire, rebellion inflated her gentle,\\ncharming form. Then she burst forth, with the growl of a slave driven to\\nextremities.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, no, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t leave you alone! Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough of it. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell\\nyou whatâ\\x80\\x99s stifling me, what has been killing me ever since I have known\\nyou. Ah! that painting, yes, your painting, sheâ\\x80\\x99s the murderess who\\nhas poisoned my life! I had a presentiment of it on the first day; your\\npainting frightened me as if it were a monster. I found it abominable,\\nexecrable; but then, oneâ\\x80\\x99s cowardly, I loved you too much not to like\\nit also; I ended by growing accustomed to it! But later on, how I\\nsuffered!--how it tortured me! For ten years I donâ\\x80\\x99t recollect having\\nspent a day without shedding tears. No, leave me! I am easing my mind,\\nI must speak out, since I have found strength enough to do so. For ten\\nyears I have been abandoned and crushed every day. Ah! to be nothing\\nmore to you, to feel myself cast more and more on one side, to fall\\nto the rank of a servant; and to see that other one, that thief, place\\nherself between you and me and clutch hold of you and triumph and insult\\nme! For dare, yes, dare to say that she hasnâ\\x80\\x99t taken possession of\\nyou, limb by limb, glided into your brain, your heart, your flesh,\\neverywhere! She holds you like a vice, she feeds on you; in fact,\\nsheâ\\x80\\x99s your wife, not I. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s the only one you care for! Ah! the cursed\\nwretch, the hussy!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude was now listening to her, in his astonishment at that dolorous\\noutburst; and being but half roused from his exasperated creative dream,\\nhe did not as yet very well understand why she was talking to him like\\nthat. And at sight of his stupor, the shuddering of a man surprised in\\na debauch, she flew into a still greater passion; she mounted the steps,\\ntore the candlestick from his hand, and in her turn flashed the light in\\nfront of the picture.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Just look!â\\x80\\x99 she cried, â\\x80\\x98just tell me how you have improved matters?\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s hideous, itâ\\x80\\x99s lamentable and grotesque; youâ\\x80\\x99ll end by seeing so\\nyourself. Come, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it ugly, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it idiotic? You see very well that\\nyou are conquered, so why should you persist any longer? There is no\\nsense in it, thatâ\\x80\\x99s what upsets me. If you canâ\\x80\\x99t be a great painter,\\nlife, at least, remains to us. Ah! life, life!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had placed the candle on the platform of the steps, and as he had\\ngone down, staggering, she sprang off to join him, and they both found\\nthemselves below, he crouching on the last step, and she pressing his\\ninert, dangling hands with all her strength.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Come, thereâ\\x80\\x99s life! Drive your nightmare away, and let us live, live\\ntogether. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it too stupid, to be we two together, to be growing old\\nalready, and to torture ourselves, and fail in every attempt to find\\nhappiness? Oh! the grave will take us soon enough, never fear. Letâ\\x80\\x99s try\\nto live, and love one another. Remember Bennecourt! Listen to my dream.\\nI should like to be able to take you away to-morrow. We would go far\\nfrom this cursed Paris, we would find a quiet spot somewhere, and you\\nwould see how pleasant I would make your life; how nice it would be\\nto forget everything together! Of a morning there are strolls in the\\nsunlight, the breakfast which smells nice, the idle afternoon, the\\nevening spent side by side under the lamp! And no more worrying about\\nchimeras, nothing but the delight of living! Doesnâ\\x80\\x99t it suffice that I\\nlove you, that I adore you, that I am willing to be your servant, your\\nslave, to exist solely for your pleasures? Do you hear, I love you, I\\nlove you? there is nothing else, and that is enough--I love you!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe had freed his hands, and making a gesture of refusal, he said, in a\\ngloomy voice:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, it is not enough! I _wonâ\\x80\\x99t_ go away with you, I _wonâ\\x80\\x99t_ be happy, I\\n_will paint_!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And I shall die of it, eh? And you will die of it, and we shall end by\\nleaving all our blood and all our tears in it! Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing beyond\\nArt, that is the fierce almighty god who strikes us with his thunder,\\nand whom you honour! he may crush us, since he is the master, and you\\nwill still bless his name!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, I belong to that god, he may do what he pleases with me. I\\nshould die if I no longer painted, and I prefer to paint and die of it.\\nBesides, my will is nothing in the matter. Nothing exists beyond art;\\nlet the world burst!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe drew herself up in a fresh spurt of anger. Her voice became harsh\\nand passionate again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But I--I am alive, and the women you love are lifeless! Oh! donâ\\x80\\x99t say\\nno! I know very well that all those painted women of yours are the only\\nones you care about! Before I was yours I had already perceived it.\\nThen, for a short time you appeared to love me. It was at that period\\nyou told me all that nonsense about your fondness for your creations.\\nYou held such shadows in pity when you were with me; but it didnâ\\x80\\x99t last.\\nYou returned to them, oh! like a maniac returns to his mania. I, though\\nliving, no longer existed for you; it was they, the visions, who again\\nbecame the only realities of your life. What I then endured you never\\nknew, for you are wonderfully ignorant of women. I have lived by your\\nside without your ever understanding me. Yes, I was jealous of those\\npainted creatures. When I posed to you, only one idea lent me the\\ncourage that I needed. I wanted to fight them, I hoped to win you back;\\nbut you granted me nothing, not even a kiss on my shoulder! Oh, God!\\nhow ashamed I sometimes felt! What grief I had to force back at finding\\nmyself thus disdained and thus betrayed!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe continued boldly, she spoke out freely--she, so strangely compounded\\nof passion and modesty. And she was not mistaken in her jealousy when\\nshe accused his art of being responsible for his neglect of herself.\\nAt the bottom of it all, there was the theory which he had repeated a\\nhundred times in her presence: genius should be chaste, an artistâ\\x80\\x99s only\\nspouse should be his work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You repulse me,â\\x80\\x99 she concluded violently; â\\x80\\x98you draw back from me as\\nif I displeased you! And you love what? A nothing, a mere semblance, a\\nlittle dust, some colour spread upon a canvas! But, once more, look at\\nher, look at your woman up yonder! See what a monster you have made\\nof her in your madness! Are there any women like that? Have any women\\ngolden limbs, and flowers on their bodies? Wake up, open your eyes,\\nreturn to life again!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude, obeying the imperious gesture with which she pointed to the\\npicture, had now risen and was looking. The candle, which had remained\\nupon the platform of the steps, illumined the nude woman like a taper\\nin front of an altar, whilst the whole room around remained plunged in\\ndarkness. He was at length awakening from his dream, and the woman\\nthus seen from below, at a distance of a few paces, filled him with\\nstupefaction. Who had just painted that idol of some unknown religion?\\nWho had wrought her of metals, marbles, and gems? Was it he who had\\nunconsciously created that symbol of insatiable passion, that unhuman\\npresentment of flesh, which had become transformed into gold and\\ndiamonds under his fingers, in his vain effort to make it live? He\\ngasped and felt afraid of his work, trembling at the thought of that\\nsudden plunge into the infinite, and understanding at last that it\\nhad become impossible for him even to depict Reality, despite his long\\neffort to conquer and remould it, making it yet more real with his human\\nhands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98You see! you see!â\\x80\\x99 Christine repeated, victoriously. And he, in a very\\nlow voice, stammered:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh! what have I done? Is it impossible to create, then? Havenâ\\x80\\x99t our\\nhands the power to create beings?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe felt that he was giving way, and she caught him in her arms:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98But why all this folly?--why think of anyone but me--I who love\\nyou? You took me for your model, but what was the use, say? Are those\\npaintings of yours worth me? They are frightful, they are as stiff, as\\ncold as corpses. But I am alive, and I love you!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe seemed to be at that moment the very incarnation of passionate\\nlove. He turned and looked at her, and little by little he returned her\\nembrace; she was softening him and conquering him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Listen!â\\x80\\x99 she continued. â\\x80\\x98I know that you had a frightful thought; yes,\\nI never dared to speak to you about it, because one must never bring\\non misfortune; but I no longer sleep of a night, you frighten me. This\\nevening I followed you to that bridge which I hate, and I trembled, oh!\\nI thought that it was all over--that I had lost you. Oh, God! what would\\nbecome of me? I need you--you surely do not wish to kill me! Let us live\\nand love one another--yes, love one another!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, in the emotion caused him by her infinite passion and grief, he\\nyielded. He pressed her to him, sobbing and stammering:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is true I had that frightful thought--I should have done it, and I\\nonly resisted on thinking of that unfinished picture. But can I still\\nlive if work will have nothing more to do with me? How can I live after\\nthat, after whatâ\\x80\\x99s there, what I spoilt just now?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98I will love you, and you will live.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! you will never love me enough--I know myself. Something which\\ndoes not exist would be necessary--something which would make me forget\\neverything. You were already unable to change me. You cannot accomplish\\na miracle!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen, as she protested and kissed him passionately, he went on: â\\x80\\x98Well,\\nyes, save me! Yes, save me, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t want me to kill myself! Lull\\nme, annihilate me, so that I may become your thing, slave enough, small\\nenough to dwell under your feet, in your slippers. Ah! to live only on\\nyour perfume, to obey you like a dog, to eat and sleep--if I could, if I\\nonly _could_!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe raised a cry of victory: â\\x80\\x98At last you are mine! There is only I\\nleft, the other is quite dead!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd she dragged him from the execrated painting, she carried him off\\ntriumphantly. The candle, now nearly consumed, flared up for a minute\\nbehind them on the steps, before the big painting, and then went out. It\\nwas victory, yes, but could it last?\\n\\nDaylight was about to break, and Christine lay asleep beside Claude. She\\nwas breathing softly, and a smile played upon her lips. He had closed\\nhis eyes; and yet, despite himself, he opened them afresh and gazed into\\nthe darkness. Sleep fled from him, and confused ideas again ascended\\nto his brain. As the dawn appeared, yellowishly dirty, like a splash\\nof liquid mud on the window-panes, he started, fancying that he heard\\na loud voice calling to him from the far end of the studio. Then,\\nirresistibly, despite a few brief hoursâ\\x80\\x99 forgetfulness, all his old\\nthoughts returned, overflowing and torturing him, hollowing his cheeks\\nand contracting his jaws in the disgust he felt for mankind. Two\\nwrinkles imparted intense bitterness to the expression of his face,\\nwhich looked like the wasted countenance of an old man. And suddenly\\nthe loud voice from the far end of the studio imperiously summoned him\\na second time. Then he quite made up his mind: it was all over, he\\nsuffered too much, he could no longer live, since everything was a lie,\\nsince there was nothing left upon earth. Love! what was it? Nought but\\na passing illusion. This thought at last mastered him, possessed him\\nentirely; and soon the craving for nothingness as his only refuge came\\non him stronger than ever. At first he let Christineâ\\x80\\x99s head slip down\\nfrom his shoulder on which it rested. And then, as a third summons rang\\nout in his mind, he rose and went to the studio, saying:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99m coming,â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe sky did not clear, it still remained dirty and mournful--it was one\\nof those lugubrious winter dawns; and an hour later Christine herself\\nawoke with a great chilly shiver. She did not understand at first. How\\ndid it happen that she was alone? Then she remembered: she had fallen\\nasleep with her cheek against his. How was it then that he had left her?\\nWhere could he be? Suddenly, amid her torpor, she sprang out of bed and\\nran into the studio. Good God! had he returned to the other then? Had\\nthe other seized hold of him again, when she herself fancied that she\\nhad conquered him for ever?\\n\\nShe saw nothing at the first glance she took; in the cold and murky\\nmorning twilight the studio seemed to her to be deserted. But whilst she\\nwas tranquillising herself at seeing nobody there, she raised her eyes\\nto the canvas, and a terrible cry leapt from her gaping mouth:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Claude! oh, Claude!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nClaude had hanged himself from the steps in front of his spoilt work. He\\nhad simply taken one of the cords which held the frame to the wall,\\nand had mounted the platform, so as to fasten the rope to an oaken\\ncrosspiece, which he himself had one day nailed to the uprights to\\nconsolidate them. Then from up above he had leapt into space. He was\\nhanging there in his shirt, with his feet bare, looking horrible, with\\nhis black tongue protruding, and his bloodshot eyes starting from their\\norbits; he seemed to have grown frightfully tall in his motionless\\nstiffness, and his face was turned towards the picture, close to the\\nnude woman, as if he had wished to infuse his soul into her with\\nhis last gasp, and as if he were still looking at her with his\\nexpressionless eyes.\\n\\nChristine, however, remained erect, quite overwhelmed with the grief,\\nfright, and anger which dilated her body. Only a continuous howl\\ncame from her throat. She opened her arms, stretched them towards the\\npicture, and clenched both hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Oh, Claude! oh, Claude!â\\x80\\x99 she gasped at last, â\\x80\\x98she has taken you\\nback--the hussy has killed you, killed you, killed you!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen her legs gave way. She span round and fell all of a heap upon the\\ntiled flooring. Her excessive suffering had taken all the blood from her\\nheart, and, fainting away, she lay there, as if she were dead, like a\\nwhite rag, miserable, done for, crushed beneath the fierce sovereignty\\nof Art. Above her the nude woman rose radiant in her symbolic idolâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbrightness; painting triumphed, alone immortal and erect, even when mad.\\n\\nAt nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock on the Monday morning, when Sandoz, after the\\nformalities and delay occasioned by the suicide, arrived in the Rue\\nTourlaque for the funeral, he found only a score of people on the\\nfootway. Despite his great grief, he had been running about for three\\ndays, compelled to attend to everything. At first, as Christine had\\nbeen picked up half dead, he had been obliged to have her carried to the\\nHopital de Lariboisiere; then he had gone from the municipal offices,\\nto the undertakerâ\\x80\\x99s and the church, paying everywhere, and full of\\nindifference so far as that went, since the priests were willing to pray\\nover that corpse with a black circle round its neck. Among the people\\nwho were waiting he as yet only perceived some neighbours, together\\nwith a few inquisitive folk; while other people peered out of the house\\nwindows and whispered together, excited by the tragedy. Claudeâ\\x80\\x99s friends\\nwould, no doubt, soon come. He, Sandoz, had not been able to write to\\nany members of the family, as he did not know their addresses. However,\\nhe retreated into the background on the arrival of two relatives, whom\\nthree lines in the newspapers had roused from the forgetfulness in\\nwhich Claude himself, no doubt, had left them. There was an old female\\ncousin,* with the equivocal air of a dealer in second-hand goods, and\\na male cousin, of the second degree, a wealthy man, decorated with the\\nLegion of Honour, and owning one of the large Paris drapery shops.\\nHe showed himself good-naturedly condescending in his elegance, and\\ndesirous of displaying an enlightened taste for art. The female cousin\\nat once went upstairs, turned round the studio, sniffed at all the bare\\nwretchedness, and then walked down again, with a hard mouth, as if she\\nwere irritated at having taken the trouble to come. The second cousin,\\non the contrary, drew himself up and walked first behind the hearse,\\nfilling the part of chief mourner with proud and pleasant fitness.\\n\\n  * Madame Sidonie, who figures in M. Zolaâ\\x80\\x99s novel, â\\x80\\x98La Curee.â\\x80\\x99\\n    The male cousin, mentioned immediately afterwards, is Octave\\n    Mouret, the leading character of â\\x80\\x98Pot-Bouilleâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98Au Bonheur\\n    des Dames.â\\x80\\x99--ED.\\n\\nAs the procession was starting off, Bongrand came up, and, after shaking\\nhands with Sandoz, remained beside him. He was gloomy, and, glancing at\\nthe fifteen or twenty strangers who followed, he murmured:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! poor chap! What! are there only we two?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDubuche was at Cannes with his children. Jory and Fagerolles kept away,\\nthe former hating the deceased and the latter being too busy. Mahoudeau\\nalone caught the party up at the rise of the Rue Lepic, and he explained\\nthat Gagniere must have missed the train.\\n\\nThe hearse slowly ascended the steep thoroughfare which winds round\\nthe flanks of the height of Montmartre; and now and then cross streets,\\nsloping downward, sudden gaps amid the houses, showed one the immensity\\nof Paris as deep and as broad as a sea. When the party arrived in front\\nof the Church of St. Pierre, and the coffin was carried up the steps,\\nit overtopped the great city for a moment. There was a grey wintry sky\\noverhead, large masses of clouds swept along, carried away by an icy\\nwind, and in the mist Paris seemed to expand, to become endless, filling\\nthe horizon with threatening billows. The poor fellow who had wished to\\nconquer it, and had broken his neck in his fruitless efforts, now passed\\nin front of it, nailed under an oaken board, returning to the earth like\\none of the cityâ\\x80\\x99s muddy waves.\\n\\nOn leaving the church the female cousin disappeared, Mahoudeau likewise;\\nwhile the second cousin again took his position behind the hearse. Seven\\nother unknown persons decided to follow, and they started for the new\\ncemetery of St. Ouen, to which the populace has given the disquieting\\nand lugubrious name of Cayenne. There were ten mourners in all.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, we two shall be the only old friends,â\\x80\\x99 repeated Bongrand as he\\nwalked on beside Sandoz.\\n\\nThe procession, preceded by the mourning coach in which the priest and\\nthe choirboy were seated, now descended the other side of the height,\\nalong winding streets as precipitous as mountain paths. The horses of\\nthe hearse slipped over the slimy pavement; one could hear the wheels\\njolting noisily. Right behind, the ten mourners took short and careful\\nsteps, trying to avoid the puddles, and being so occupied with the\\ndifficulty of the descent that they refrained from speaking. But at\\nthe bottom of the Rue du Ruisseau, when they reached the Porte de\\nClignancourt and the vast open spaces, where the boulevard running round\\nthe city, the circular railway, the talus and moat of the fortifications\\nare displayed to view, there came sighs of relief, a few words were\\nexchanged, and the party began to straggle.\\n\\nSandoz and Bongrand by degrees found themselves behind all the others,\\nas if they had wished to isolate themselves from those folk whom they\\nhad never previously seen. Just as the hearse was passing the city gate,\\nthe painter leant towards the novelist.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And the little woman, what is going to be done with her?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! how dreadful it is!â\\x80\\x99 replied Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98I went to see her yesterday\\nat the hospital. She has brain fever. The house doctor maintains that\\nthey will save her, but that she will come out of it ten years older and\\nwithout any strength. Do you know that she had come to such a point\\nthat she no longer knew how to spell. Such a crushing fall, a young lady\\nabased to the level of a drudge! Yes, if we donâ\\x80\\x99t take care of her like\\na cripple, she will end by becoming a scullery-maid somewhere.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98And not a copper, of course?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Not a copper. I thought I should find the studies Claude made from\\nnature for his large picture, those superb studies which he afterwards\\nturned to such poor account. But I ferreted everywhere; he gave\\neverything away; people robbed him. No, nothing to sell, not a canvas\\nthat could be turned to profit, nothing but that huge picture, which I\\ndemolished and burnt with my own hands, and right gladly, I assure you,\\neven as one avenges oneself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey became silent for a moment. The broad road leading to St. Ouen\\nstretched out quite straight as far as the eye could reach; and over the\\nplain went the procession, pitifully small, lost, as it were, on that\\nhighway, along which there flowed a river of mud. A line of palings\\nbordered it on either side, waste land extended both to right and left,\\nwhile afar off one only saw some factory chimneys and a few lofty white\\nhouses, standing alone, obliquely to the road. They passed through the\\nClignancourt fete, with booths, circuses, and roundabouts on either\\nside, all shivering in the abandonment of winter, empty dancing cribs,\\nmouldy swings, and a kind of stage homestead, â\\x80\\x98The Picardy Farm,â\\x80\\x99\\nlooking dismally sad between its broken fences.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! his old canvases,â\\x80\\x99 resumed Bongrand, â\\x80\\x98the things he had at the Quai\\nde Bourbon, do you remember them? There were some extraordinary bits\\namong them. The landscapes he brought back from the south and the\\nacademy studies he painted at Boutinâ\\x80\\x99s--a girlâ\\x80\\x99s legs and a womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntrunk, for instance. Oh, that trunk! Old Malgras must have it. A\\nmagisterial study it was, which not one of our â\\x80\\x9cyoung mastersâ\\x80\\x9d could\\npaint. Yes, yes, the fellow was no fool--simply a great painter.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98When I think,â\\x80\\x99 said Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98that those little humbugs of the School\\nand the press accused him of idleness and ignorance, repeating one\\nafter the other that he had always refused to learn his art. Idle! good\\nheavens! why, I have seen him faint with fatigue after sittings ten\\nhours long; he gave his whole life to his work, and killed himself in\\nhis passion for toil! And they call him ignorant--how idiotic! They\\nwill never understand that the individual gift which a man brings in\\nhis nature is superior to all acquired knowledge. Delacroix also was\\nignorant of his profession in their eyes, simply because he could not\\nconfine himself to hard and fast rules! Ah! the ninnies, the slavish\\npupils who are incapable of painting anything incorrectly!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe took a few steps in silence, and then he added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98A heroic worker, too--a passionate observer whose brain was crammed\\nwith science--the temperament of a great artist endowed with admirable\\ngifts. And to think that he leaves nothing, nothing!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Absolutely nothing, not a canvas,â\\x80\\x99 declared Bongrand. â\\x80\\x98I know nothing\\nof his but rough drafts, sketches, notes carelessly jotted down, as it\\nwere, all that artistic paraphernalia which canâ\\x80\\x99t be submitted to the\\npublic. Yes, indeed, it is really a dead man, dead completely, who is\\nabout to be lowered into the grave.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, the painter and the novelist now had to hasten their steps, for\\nthey had got far behind the others while talking; and the hearse, after\\nrolling past taverns and shops full of tombstones and crosses, was\\nturning to the right into the short avenue leading to the cemetery. They\\novertook it, and passed through the gateway with the little procession.\\nThe priest in his surplice and the choirboy carrying the holy water\\nreceiver, who had both alighted from the mourning coach, walked on\\nahead.\\n\\nIt was a large flat cemetery, still in its youth, laid out by rule\\nand line in the suburban waste land, and divided into squares by broad\\nsymmetrical paths. A few raised tombs bordered the principal avenues,\\nbut most of the graves, already very numerous, were on a level with the\\nsoil. They were hastily arranged temporary sepulchres, for five-year\\ngrants were the only ones to be obtained, and families hesitated to go\\nto any serious expense. Thus, the stones sinking into the ground for\\nlack of foundations, the scrubby evergreens which had not yet had time\\nto grow, all the provisional slop kind of mourning that one saw there,\\nimparted to that vast field of repose a look of poverty and cold, clean,\\ndismal bareness like that of a barracks or a hospital. There was not a\\ncorner to be found recalling the graveyard nooks sung of in the ballads\\nof the romantic period, not one leafy turn quivering with mystery, not\\na single large tomb speaking of pride and eternity. You were in the new\\nstyle of Paris cemetery, where everything is set out straight and duly\\nnumbered--the cemetery of democratic times, where the dead seem to\\nslumber at the bottom of an office drawer, after filing past one by\\none, as people do at a fete under the eyes of the police, so as to avoid\\nobstruction.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dash it!â\\x80\\x99 muttered Bongrand, â\\x80\\x98it isnâ\\x80\\x99t lively here.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Why not?â\\x80\\x99 asked Sandoz. â\\x80\\x98Itâ\\x80\\x99s commodious; there is plenty of air. And\\neven although there is no sun, see what a pretty colour it all has.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIn fact, under the grey sky of that November morning, in the penetrating\\nquiver of the wind, the low tombs, laden with garlands and crowns of\\nbeads, assumed soft tints of charming delicacy. There were some quite\\nwhite, and others all black, according to the colour of the beads. But\\nthe contrast lost much of its force amid the pale green foliage of the\\ndwarfish trees. Poor families exhausted their affection for the dear\\ndeparted in decking those five-year grants; there were piles of crowns\\nand blooming flowers--freshly brought there on the recent Day of\\nthe Dead. Only the cut flowers had as yet faded, between their paper\\ncollars. Some crowns of yellow immortelles shone out like freshly\\nchiselled gold. But the beads predominated to such a degree that at\\nthe first glance there seemed to be nothing else; they gushed forth\\neverywhere, hiding the inscriptions and covering the stones and\\nrailings. There were beads forming hearts, beads in festoons and\\nmedallions, beads framing either ornamental designs or objects under\\nglass, such as velvet pansies, wax hands entwined, satin bows, or, at\\ntimes, even photographs of women--yellow, faded, cheap photographs,\\nshowing poor, ugly, touching faces that smiled awkwardly.\\n\\nAs the hearse proceeded along the Avenue du Rond Point, Sandoz, whose\\nlast remark--since it was of an artistic nature--had brought him back to\\nClaude, resumed the conversation, saying:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98This is a cemetery which he would have understood, he who was so mad\\non modern things. No doubt he suffered physically, wasted away by the\\nover-severe lesion that is so often akin to genius, â\\x80\\x9cthree grains too\\nlittle, or three grains too much, of some substance in the brain,â\\x80\\x9d as\\nhe himself said when he reproached his parents for his constitution.\\nHowever, his disorder was not merely a personal affair, he was\\nthe victim of our period. Yes, our generation has been soaked in\\nromanticism, and we have remained impregnated with it. It is in\\nvain that we wash ourselves and take baths of reality, the stain is\\nobstinate, and all the scrubbing in the world wonâ\\x80\\x99t take it away.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBongrand smiled. â\\x80\\x98Oh! as for romanticism,â\\x80\\x99 said he, â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99m up to my ears\\nin it. It has fed my art, and, indeed, Iâ\\x80\\x99m impenitent. If it be true\\nthat my final impotence is due to that, well, after all, what does it\\nmatter? I canâ\\x80\\x99t deny the religion of my artistic life. However, your\\nremark is quite correct; you other fellows, you are rebellious sons.\\nClaude, for instance, with his big nude woman amid the quays, that\\nextravagant symbol--â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah, that woman!â\\x80\\x99 interrupted Sandoz, â\\x80\\x98it was she who throttled him! If\\nyou knew how he worshipped her! I was never able to cast her out of\\nhim. And how can one possibly have clear perception, a solid,\\nproperly-balanced brain when such phantasmagoria sprouts forth from your\\nskull? Though coming after yours, our generation is too imaginative to\\nleave healthy work behind it. Another generation, perhaps two, will be\\nrequired before people will be able to paint and write logically, with\\nthe high, pure simplicity of truth. Truth, nature alone, is the right\\nbasis, the necessary guide, outside of which madness begins; and the\\ntoiler neednâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid of flattening his work, his temperament is\\nthere, which will always carry him sufficiently away. Does any one\\ndream of denying personality, the involuntary thumb-stroke which deforms\\nwhatever we touch and constitutes our poor creativeness?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHowever, he turned his head, and involuntarily added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Hallo! whatâ\\x80\\x99s burning? Are they lighting bonfires here?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe procession had turned on reaching the Rond Point, where the ossuary\\nwas situated--the common vault gradually filled with all the remnants\\nremoved from the graves, and the stone slab of which, in the centre of\\na circular lawn, disappeared under a heap of wreaths, deposited there\\nby the pious relatives of those who no longer had an individual\\nresting-place. And, as the hearse rolled slowly to the left in\\ntransversal Avenue No. 2, there had come a sound of crackling, and thick\\nsmoke had risen above the little plane trees bordering the path. Some\\ndistance ahead, as the party approached, they could see a large pile of\\nearthy things beginning to burn, and they ended by understanding. The\\nfire was lighted at the edge of a large square patch of ground, which\\nhad been dug up in broad parallel furrows, so as to remove the coffins\\nbefore allotting the soil to other corpses; just as the peasant turns\\nthe stubble over before sowing afresh. The long empty furrows seemed\\nto yawn, the mounds of rich soil seemed to be purifying under the broad\\ngrey sky; and the fire thus burning in that corner was formed of the\\nrotten wood of the coffins that had been removed--slit, broken boards,\\neaten into by the earth, often reduced to a ruddy humus, and gathered\\ntogether in an enormous pile. They broke up with faint detonations, and\\nbeing damp with human mud, they refused to flame, and merely smoked with\\ngrowing intensity. Large columns of the smoke rose into the pale sky,\\nand were beaten down by the November wind, and torn into ruddy shreds,\\nwhich flew across the low tombs of quite one half of the cemetery.\\n\\nSandoz and Bongrand had looked at the scene without saying a word. Then,\\nhaving passed the fire, the former resumed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98No, he did not prove to be the man of the formula he laid down. I mean\\nthat his genius was not clear enough to enable him to set that formula\\nerect and impose it upon the world by a definite masterpiece. And now\\nsee how other fellows scatter their efforts around him, after him! They\\ngo no farther than roughing off, they give us mere hasty impressions,\\nand not one of them seems to have strength enough to become the master\\nwho is awaited. Isnâ\\x80\\x99t it irritating, this new notion of light, this\\npassion for truth carried as far as scientific analysis, this evolution\\nbegun with so much originality, and now loitering on the way, as it\\nwere, falling into the hands of tricksters, and never coming to a head,\\nsimply because the necessary man isnâ\\x80\\x99t born? But pooh! the man will be\\nborn; nothing is ever lost, light must be.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Who knows? not always,â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand. â\\x80\\x98Life miscarries, like\\neverything else. I listen to you, you know, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m a despairer. I am\\ndying of sadness, and I feel that everything else is dying. Ah! yes,\\nthere is something unhealthy in the atmosphere of the times--this end of\\na century is all demolition, a litter of broken monuments, and soil\\nthat has been turned over and over a hundred times, the whole exhaling a\\nstench of death! Can anybody remain in good health amid all that?\\nOneâ\\x80\\x99s nerves become unhinged, the great neurosis is there, art grows\\nunsettled, there is general bustling, perfect anarchy, all the madness\\nof self-love at bay. Never have people quarrelled more and seen less\\nclearly than since it is pretended that one knows everything.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz, who had grown pale, watched the large ruddy coils of smoke\\nrolling in the wind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98It was fated,â\\x80\\x99 he mused in an undertone. â\\x80\\x98Our excessive activity and\\npride of knowledge were bound to cast us back into doubt. This century,\\nwhich has already thrown so much light over the world, was bound to\\nfinish amid the threat of a fresh flow of darkness--yes, our discomfort\\ncomes from that! Too much has been promised, too much has been hoped\\nfor; people have looked forward to the conquest and explanation of\\neverything, and now they growl impatiently. What! donâ\\x80\\x99t things go\\nquicker than that? What! hasnâ\\x80\\x99t science managed to bring us absolute\\ncertainty, perfect happiness, in a hundred years? Then what is the use\\nof going on, since one will never know everything, and oneâ\\x80\\x99s bread will\\nalways be as bitter? It is as if the century had become bankrupt, as if\\nit had failed; pessimism twists peopleâ\\x80\\x99s bowels, mysticism fogs their\\nbrains; for we have vainly swept phantoms away with the light of\\nanalysis, the supernatural has resumed hostilities, the spirit of\\nthe legends rebels and wants to conquer us, while we are halting with\\nfatigue and anguish. Ah! I certainly donâ\\x80\\x99t affirm anything; I myself\\nam tortured. Only it seems to me that this last convulsion of the old\\nreligious terrors was to be foreseen. We are not the end, we are but a\\ntransition, a beginning of something else. It calms me and does me good\\nto believe that we are marching towards reason, and the substantiality\\nof science.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHis voice had become husky with emotion, and he added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That is, unless madness plunges us, topsy-turvy, into night again, and\\nwe all go off throttled by the ideal, like our old friend who sleeps\\nthere between his four boards.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe hearse was leaving transversal Avenue No. 2 to turn, on the right,\\ninto lateral Avenue No. 3, and the painter, without speaking, called\\nthe novelistâ\\x80\\x99s attention to a square plot of graves, beside which the\\nprocession was now passing.\\n\\nThere was here a childrenâ\\x80\\x99s cemetery, nothing but childrenâ\\x80\\x99s tombs,\\nstretching far away in orderly fashion, separated at regular intervals\\nby narrow paths, and looking like some infantile city of death. There\\nwere tiny little white crosses, tiny little white railings, disappearing\\nalmost beneath an efflorescence of white and blue wreaths, on a level\\nwith the soil; and that peaceful field of repose, so soft in colour,\\nwith the bluish tint of milk about it, seemed to have been made flowery\\nby all the childhood lying in the earth. The crosses recorded various\\nages, two years, sixteen months, five months. One poor little cross,\\ndestitute of any railing, was out of line, having been set up slantingly\\nacross a path, and it simply bore the words: â\\x80\\x98Eugenie, three days.â\\x80\\x99\\nScarcely to exist as yet, and withal to sleep there already, alone, on\\none side, like the children who on festive occasions dine at a little\\nside table!\\n\\nHowever, the hearse had at last stopped, in the middle of the avenue;\\nand when Sandoz saw the grave ready at the corner of the next division,\\nin front of the cemetery of the little ones, he murmured tenderly:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Ah! my poor old Claude, with your big childâ\\x80\\x99s heart, you will be in\\nyour place beside them.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe under-bearers removed the coffin from the hearse. The priest, who\\nlooked surly, stood waiting in the wind; some sextons were there with\\ntheir shovels. Three neighbours had fallen off on the road, the ten had\\ndwindled into seven. The second cousin, who had been holding his hat in\\nhis hand since leaving the church, despite the frightful weather, now\\ndrew nearer. All the others uncovered, and the prayers were about to\\nbegin, when a loud piercing whistle made everybody look up.\\n\\nBeyond this corner of the cemetery as yet untenanted, at the end of\\nlateral Avenue No. 3, a train was passing along the high embankment of\\nthe circular railway which overlooked the graveyard. The grassy slope\\nrose up, and a number of geometrical lines, as it were, stood out\\nblackly against the grey sky; there were telegraph-posts, connected by\\nthin wires, a superintendentâ\\x80\\x99s box, and a red signal plate, the only\\nbright throbbing speck visible. When the train rolled past, with its\\nthunder-crash, one plainly distinguished, as on the transparency of a\\nshadow play, the silhouettes of the carriages, even the heads of the\\npassengers showing in the light gaps left by the windows. And the line\\nbecame clear again, showing like a simple ink stroke across the horizon;\\nwhile far away other whistles called and wailed unceasingly, shrill with\\nanger, hoarse with suffering, or husky with distress. Then a guardâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhorn resounded lugubriously.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98_Revertitur in terram suam unde erat_,â\\x80\\x99 recited the priest, who had\\nopened a book and was making haste.\\n\\nBut he was not heard, for a large engine had come up puffing, and was\\nmanoeuvring backwards and forwards near the funeral party. It had a loud\\nthick voice, a guttural whistle, which was intensely mournful. It came\\nand went, panting; and seen in profile it looked like a heavy monster.\\nSuddenly, moreover, it let off steam, with all the furious blowing of a\\ntempest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98_Requiescat in pace_,â\\x80\\x99 said the priest.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Amen,â\\x80\\x99 replied the choirboy.\\n\\nBut the words were again lost amid the lashing, deafening detonation,\\nwhich was prolonged with the continuous violence of a fusillade.\\n\\nBongrand, quite exasperated, turned towards the engine. It became\\nsilent, fortunately, and every one felt relieved. Tears had risen to\\nthe eyes of Sandoz, who had already been stirred by the words which had\\ninvoluntarily passed his lips, while he walked behind his old comrade,\\ntalking as if they had been having one of their familiar chats of yore;\\nand now it seemed to him as if his youth were about to be consigned to\\nthe earth. It was part of himself, the best part, his illusions and his\\nenthusiasm, which the sextons were taking away to lower into the depths.\\nAt that terrible moment an accident occurred which increased his grief.\\nIt had rained so hard during the preceding days, and the ground was so\\nsoft, that a sudden subsidence of soil took place. One of the sextons\\nhad to jump into the grave and empty it with his shovel with a slow\\nrhythmical movement. There was no end to the matter, the funeral seemed\\nlikely to last for ever amid the impatience of the priest and the\\ninterest of the four neighbours who had followed on to the end, though\\nnobody could say why. And up above, on the embankment, the engine had\\nbegun manoeuvring again, retreating and howling at each turn of its\\nwheels, its fire-box open the while, and lighting up the gloomy scene\\nwith a rain of sparks.\\n\\nAt last the pit was emptied, the coffin lowered, and the aspergillus\\npassed round. It was all over. The second cousin, standing erect, did\\nthe honours with his correct, pleasant air, shaking hands with all these\\npeople whom he had never previously seen, in memory of the relative\\nwhose name he had not remembered the day before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98That linen-draper is a very decent fellow,â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand, who was\\nswallowing his tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Quite so,â\\x80\\x99 replied Sandoz, sobbing.\\n\\nAll the others were going off, the surplices of the priest and the\\nchoirboy disappeared between the green trees, while the straggling\\nneighbours loitered reading the inscriptions on the surrounding tombs.\\n\\nThen Sandoz, making up his mind to leave the grave, which was now half\\nfilled, resumed:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98We alone shall have known him. There is nothing left of him, not even a\\nname!â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98He is very happy,â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand; â\\x80\\x98he has no picture on hand, in the\\nearth where he sleeps. It is as well to go off as to toil as we do\\nmerely to turn out infirm children, who always lack something, their\\nlegs or their head, and who donâ\\x80\\x99t live.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Yes, one must really be wanting in pride to resign oneself to turning\\nout merely approximate work and resorting to trickery with life. I,\\nwho bestow every care on my books--I despise myself, for I feel that,\\ndespite all my efforts, they are incomplete and untruthful.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWith pale faces, they slowly went away, side by side, past the\\nchildrenâ\\x80\\x99s white tombs, the novelist then in all the strength of his\\ntoil and fame, the painter declining but covered with glory.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98There, at least, lies one who was logical and brave,â\\x80\\x99 continued Sandoz;\\nâ\\x80\\x98he confessed his powerlessness and killed himself.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thatâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand; â\\x80\\x98if we didnâ\\x80\\x99t care so much for our skins\\nwe should all do as he has done, eh?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Well, yes; since we cannot create anything, since we are but feeble\\ncopyists, we might as well put an end to ourselves at once.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAgain they found themselves before the burning pile of old rotten\\ncoffins, now fully alight, sweating and crackling; but there were still\\nno flames to be seen, the smoke alone had increased--a thick acrid\\nsmoke, which the wind carried along in whirling coils, so that it now\\ncovered the whole cemetery as with a cloud of mourning.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dash it! Eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock!â\\x80\\x99 said Bongrand, after pulling out his watch.\\nâ\\x80\\x98I must get home again.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSandoz gave an exclamation of surprise:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98What, already eleven?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOver the low-lying graves, over the vast bead-flowered field of death,\\nso formal of aspect and so cold, he cast a long look of despair, his\\neyes still bedimmed by his tears. And then he added:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98Letâ\\x80\\x99s go to work.â\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\n                              THE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of His Masterpiece, by Emile Zola\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HIS MASTERPIECE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 15900-0.txt or 15900-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/9/0/15900/\\n\\nProduced by Dagny; and David Widger\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n',\n",

When a \\n                         program like this is cut, our \\n                         children\\'s future is compromised. I \\n                         want to thank you for your support. \\n                         Enjoy the concert.\\n\\n<b>               INT.

The elderly gentleman--his hair was quite\\nwhite now--slowly shook his head, as he murmured again:\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be done, Tom! It can\\'t be done! I admit that you\\'ve made\\na lot of wonderful things--things I never dreamed of--but this is\\ntoo much. To transmit pictures over a telephone wire, so that\\npersons cannot only see to whom they are talking, as well as hear\\nthem--well, to be frank with you, Tom, I should be sorry to see\\nyou waste your time trying to invent such a thing.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t agree with you. Not only do I think it can be done, but\\nI\\'m going to do it. In fact, I\\'ve already started on it. As for\\nwasting my time, well, I haven\\'t anything in particular to do, now\\nthat my giant cannon has been perfected, so I might as well be\\nworking on my new photo telephone instead of sitting around idle.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Tom, I agree with you there,\" said Mr. Swift. \"Sitting\\naround idle isn\\'t good for anyone--man or boy, young or old. So\\ndon\\'t think I\\'m finding fault because you\\'re busy.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s only that I don\\'t want to see you throw away your efforts,\\nonly to be disappointed in the end. It can\\'t be done, Tom, it\\ncan\\'t be done,\" and the aged inventor shook his head in pitying\\ndoubt.\\n\\nTom only smiled confidently, and went on:\\n\\n\"Well, Dad, all you\\'ll have to do will be to wait and see. It\\nisn\\'t going to be easy--I grant that. In fact, I\\'ve run up against\\nmore snags, the little way I\\'ve gone so far, than I like to admit.\\nBut I\\'m going to stick at it, and before this year is out I\\'ll\\nguarantee, Father, that you can be at one end of the telephone\\nwire, talking to me, at the other, and I\\'ll see you and you\\'ll see\\nme--if not as plainly as we see each other now, at least plainly\\nenough to make sure of each other.\"\\n\\nMr. Swift chuckled silently, gradually breaking into a louder\\nlaugh. Instead of being angry, Tom only regarded his father with\\nan indulgent smile, and continued:\\n\\n\"All right, Dad. Go ahead, laugh!\"\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, I\\'m not exactly laughing at YOU--it\\'s more at the\\nidea than anything else. The idea of talking over a wire and, at\\nthe same time, having light waves, as well as electrical waves\\npassing on the same conductor!\"\\n\\n\"All right, Dad, go ahead and laugh. I don\\'t mind,\" said Tom,\\ngood-naturedly. \"Folks laughed at Bell, when he said he could send\\na human voice over a copper spring; but Bell went ahead and to-day\\nwe can talk over a thousand miles by wire. That was the telephone.\"\\n\\n\"Folks laughed at Morse when he said he could send a message over\\nthe wire. He let \\'em laugh, but we have the telegraph. Folks\\nlaughed at Edison, when he said he could take the human voice--or\\nany other sound--and fix it on a wax cylinder or a hard-rubber\\nplate--but he did it, and we have the phonograph. And folks\\nlaughed at Santos Dumont, at the Wrights, and at all the other\\nfellows, who said they could take a heavier-than-air machine, and\\nskim above the clouds like a bird; but we do it--I\\'ve done it--you\\'ve\\ndone it.\"\\n\\n\"Hold on, Tom!\" protested Mr. Swift. \"I give up! Don\\'t rub it in\\non your old dad. I admit that folks did laugh at those inventors,\\nwith their seemingly impossible schemes, but they made good. And\\nyou\\'ve made good lots of times where I thought you wouldn\\'t. But\\njust stop to consider for a moment. This thing of sending a\\npicture over a telephone wire is totally out of the question, and\\nentirely opposed to all the principles of science.\"\\n\\n\"What do I care for principles of science?\" cried Tom, and he\\nstrode about the room so rapidly that Eradicate, the old colored\\nservant, who came in with the mail, skipped out of the library\\nwith the remark:\\n\\n\"Deed, an\\' Massa Tom must be pow\\'fully preragitated dis mawnin\\'!\"\\n\\n\"Some of the scientists said it was totally opposed to all natural\\nlaws when I planned my electric rifle,\" went on Tom. \"But I made\\nit, and it shot. They said my air glider would never stay up, but\\nshe did.\"\\n\\n\"But, Tom, this is different. You are talking of sending light\\nwaves--one of the most delicate forms of motion in the world--over\\na material wire. It can\\'t be done!\"\\n\\n\"Look here, Dad!\" exclaimed Tom, coming to a halt in front of his\\nparent. \"What is light, anyhow? Merely another form of motion;\\nisn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, yes, Tom, I suppose it is.\"\\n\\n\"Of course it is,\" said Tom. \"With vibrations of a certain length\\nand rapidity we get sound--the faster the vibration per second the\\nhigher the sound note. Now, then, we have sound waves, or\\nvibrations, traveling at the rate of a mile in a little less than\\nfive seconds; that is, with the air at a temperature of sixty\\ndegrees. With each increase of a degree of temperature we get an\\nincrease of about a foot per second in the rapidity with which\\nsound travels.\"\\n\\n\"Now, then, light shoots along at the rate of 186,000,000 miles a\\nsecond. That is more than many times around the earth in a second\\nof time. So we have sound, one kind of wave motion, or energy; we\\nhave light, a higher degree of vibration or wave motion, and then\\nwe come to electricity--and nobody has ever yet exactly measured\\nthe intensity or speed of the electric vibrations.\"\\n\\n\"But what I\\'m getting at is this--that electricity must travel\\npretty nearly as fast as light--if not faster. So I believe that\\nelectricity and light have about the same kind of vibrations, or\\nwave motion.\"\\n\\n\"Now, then, if they do have--and I admit it\\'s up to me to prove\\nit,\" went on Tom, earnestly--\"why can\\'t I send light-waves over a\\nwire, as well as electrical waves?\"\\n\\nMr. Swift was silent for a moment. Then he said, slowly:\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, I never heard it argued just that way before. Maybe\\nthere\\'s something in your photo telephone after all. But it never\\nhas been done. You can\\'t deny that!\"\\n\\nHe looked at his son triumphantly. It was not because he wanted to\\nget the better of him in argument, that Mr. Swift held to his own\\nviews; but he wanted to bring out the best that was in his\\noffspring. Tom accepted the challenge instantly.\\n\\n\"Yes, Dad, it has been done, in a way!\" he said, earnestly. \"No\\none has sent a picture over a telephone wire, as far as I know,\\nbut during the recent hydroplane tests at Monte Carlo, photographs\\ntaken of some of the events in the morning, and afternoon, were\\ndeveloped in the evening, and transmitted over five hundred miles\\nof wire to Paris, and those same photographs were published in the\\nParis newspapers the next morning.\"\\n\\n\"Is that right, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"It certainly is. The photographs weren\\'t so very clear, but you\\ncould make out what they were. Of course that is a different\\nsystem than the one I\\'m thinking of. In that case they took a\\nphotograph, and made a copper plate of it, as they would for a\\nhalf-tone illustration. This gave them a picture with ridges and\\ndepressions in copper, little hills and valleys, so to speak,\\naccording to whether there were light or dark tints in the\\npicture. The dark places meant that the copper lines stood up\\nhigher there than where there were light colors.\"\\n\\n\"Now, by putting this copper plate on a wooden drum, and revolving\\nthis drum, with an electrical needle pressing lightly on the\\nridges of copper, they got a varying degree of electrical current.\\nWhere the needle touched a high place in the copper plate the\\ncontact was good, and there was a strong current. When the needle\\ngot to a light place in the copper--a depression, so to speak--the\\ncontact was not so good, and there was only a weak current.\"\\n\\n\"At the receiving end of the apparatus there was a sensitized film\\nplaced on a similar wooden drum. This was to receive the image\\nthat came over the five hundred miles of wire. Now then, as the\\nelectrical needle, moving across the copper plate, made electrical\\ncontacts of different degrees of strength, it worked a delicate\\ngalvanometer on the receiving end. The galvanometer caused a beam\\nof light to vary--to grow brighter or dimmer, according as the\\nelectrical current was stronger or weaker. And this light, falling\\non the sensitive plate, made a picture, just like the one on the\\ncopper plate in Monte Carlo.\"\\n\\n\"In other words, where the copper plate was black, showing that\\nconsiderable printing ink was needed, the negative on the other\\nend was made light. Then when that negative was printed it would\\ncome out black, because more light comes through the light places\\non a photograph negative than through the dark places. And so,\\nwith the galvanometer making light flashes on the sensitive plate,\\nthe galvanometer being governed by the electrical contacts five\\nhundred miles away, they transmitted a photograph by wire.\"\\n\\n\"But not a telephone wire, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t make any difference, Dad. It was a wire just the\\nsame. But I\\'m not going into that just now, though later I may\\nwant to send photographs by wire. What I\\'m aiming at is to make an\\napparatus so that when you go into a telephone booth to talk to a\\nfriend, you can see him and he can see you, on a specially\\nprepared plate that will be attached to the telephone.\"\\n\\n\"You mean see him as in a looking-glass, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Somewhat, yes. Though I shall probably use a metal plate instead\\nof glass. It will be just as if you were talking over a telephone\\nin an open field, where you could see the other party and he could\\nsee you.\"\\n\\n\"But how are you going to do it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I haven\\'t quite decided. I shall probably have to use the\\nmetal called selenium, which is very sensitive to light, and which\\nmakes a good or a poor electrical conductor according as more or\\nless light falls on it. After all, a photograph is only lights and\\nshadows, fixed on sensitive paper or films.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, maybe you can do it, and maybe you can\\'t. I admit\\nyou\\'ve used some good arguments,\" said Mr. Swift. \"But then, it\\nall comes down to this: What good will it be if you can succeed in\\nsending a picture over a telephone wire?\"\\n\\n\"What good, Dad? Why, lots of good. Just think how important it\\nwill be in business, if you can make sure that you are talking to\\nthe party you think you are. As it is now, unless you know the\\nperson\\'s voice, you can\\'t tell that the man on the other end of\\nthe wire is the person he says he is. And even a voice can be\\nimitated.\"\\n\\n\"But if you know the person yourself, he can\\'t be imitated. If you\\nsee him, as well as hear his voice, you are sure of what you are\\ndoing. Why, think of the big business deals that could be made\\nover the telephone if the two parties could not only hear but see\\neach other. It would be a dead sure thing then. And Mr. Brown\\nwouldn\\'t have to take Mr. Smith\\'s word that it was he who was\\ntalking. He could even get witnesses to look at the wire-image if\\nhe wanted to, and so clinch the thing. It will prevent a lot of\\nfrauds.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, maybe you\\'re right. Go ahead. I\\'ll say no more against\\nyour plans. I wish you all success, and if I can help you, call on\\nme.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks, Dad. I knew you\\'d feel that way when you understood. Now\\nI\\'m going--\"\\n\\nBut what Tom Swift was going to do he did not say just then, for\\nabove the heads of father and son sounded a rattling, crashing\\nnoise, and the whole house seemed to shake. Then the voice of\\nEradicate was heard yelling:\\n\\n\"Good land! Good land ob massy! Come out yeah, Massa Tom! Come\\nright out yeah! Dere\\'s a man on de roof an\\' he am all tangled up\\nsuthin\\' scandalous! Come right out yeah befo\\' he falls and\\ntranslocates his neck! Come on!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nBAD NEWS\\n\\n\\nWith startled glances at each other, Tom and his father rushed\\nfrom the library to the side of the house, whence came the cries\\nof Eradicate.\\n\\n\"What is it, Rad! what is it?\" questioned Tom.\\n\\n\"Is someone hurt?\" Mr. Swift wanted to know.\\n\\n\"He mighty soon will be!\" exclaimed the colored man. \"Look where\\nhe am holdin\\' on! Lucky fo\\' him he grabbed dat chimbley!\"\\n\\nTom and his father looked to where Eradicate pointed, and saw a\\nstrange sight. A small biplane-airship had become entangled in\\nsome of the aerials of Tom\\'s wireless apparatus, and the craft had\\nturned turtle, being held from falling by some of the wire braces.\\n\\nThe birdman had fallen out, but had managed to cling to the\\nchimney, so that he had not reached the ground, and there he\\nclung, while the motor of his airship was banging away, and\\nrevolving the propeller blades dangerously close to his head.\\n\\n\"Are you hurt?\" cried Tom, to the unknown birdman.\\n\\n\"No, but I\\'m likely to be unless I get out of here!\" was the\\ngasped-out answer.\\n\\n\"Hold fast!\" cried Tom. \"We\\'ll have you down in a jiffy. Here,\\nRad, you get the long ladder. Where\\'s Koku? That giant is never\\naround when he\\'s wanted. Find Koku, Rad, and send him here.\"\\n\\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom; directly, sah!\" and the colored man hastened\\noff as fast as his aged legs would take him.\\n\\nAnd while preparations are thus under way to rescue the birdman\\nfrom the roof, I will take just a few minutes to tell you a little\\nsomething more about Tom Swift and his numerous inventions, as set\\nforth in the previous books of this series.\\n\\n\"Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle\" was the first book, and in that I\\nrelated how Tom made the acquaintance of a Mr. Wakefield Damon, of\\nthe neighboring town of Waterford, and how Tom bought that\\ngentleman\\'s motor cycle, after it had tried to climb a tree with\\nits rider in the saddle. Mr. Wakefield Damon was an odd man, whose\\nfavorite expression was \"Bless my shoelaces!\" or something equally\\nabsurd. Waterford was not far from Shopton, where Tom and his\\nfather made their home.\\n\\nMr. Swift was also an inventor of note, and Tom soon followed in\\nhis father\\'s footsteps. They lived in a large house, with many\\nshops about it, for their work at times required much machinery.\\n\\nMrs. Baggert was the housekeeper who looked after Tom and his\\nfather, and got their meals, when they consented to take enough\\ntime from their inventive work to eat. Another member of the\\nhousehold was Eradicate Sampson, a genial old colored man, who\\nsaid he was named Eradicate because he used to eradicate the dirt\\nabout the place.\\n\\nKoku, just referred to by Tom, was an immense man, a veritable\\ngiant, whom Tom had brought back with him from one of his trips,\\nafter escaping from captivity. The young inventor really brought\\ntwo giants, brothers they were, but one had gone to a museum, and\\nthe other took service with our hero, making himself very useful\\nwhen it came to lifting heavy machinery.\\n\\nTom had a close friend in Ned Newton, who was employed in the\\nShopton bank. Another friend was Miss Mary Nestor, a young lady\\nwhose life Tom had once saved. He had many other friends, and some\\nenemies, whom you will meet from time to time in this story.\\n\\nAfter Tom had had many adventures on his motor cycle he acquired a\\nmotor boat, and in that he and Ned went through some strenuous\\ntimes on Lake Carlopa, near Tom\\'s home. Then followed an airship,\\nfor Tom got that craze, and in the book concerning that machine I\\nrelated some of the things that happened to him. He had even more\\nwonderful adventures in his submarine, and with his electric\\nrunabout our hero was instrumental in saving a bank from ruin by\\nmaking a trip in the speediest car on the road.\\n\\nAfter Tom Swift had sent his wireless message, and saved the\\ncastaways of Earthquake Island, he thought he would give up his\\ninventive work for a time, and settle down to a life of ease and\\nquiet.\\n\\nBut the call of the spirit of adventure was still too strong for\\nhim to resist. That was why he sought out the diamond makers, and\\nlearned the secret of Phantom Mountain. And when he went to the\\nCaves of Ice, and there saw his airship wrecked, Tom was well-nigh\\ndiscouraged, But he managed to get back to civilization, and later\\nundertook a journey to elephant land, with his powerful electric\\nrifle.\\n\\nMarvelous adventures underground did Tom Swift have when he went\\nto the City of Gold, and I have set down some of them in the book\\nbearing the latter title. Later on he sought the platinum treasure\\nin his air glider. And when Tom was taken captive, in giant land,\\nonly his speedy airship saved him from a hard fate.\\n\\nBy this time moving pictures were beginning to occupy a large\\nplace in the scientific, as well as the amusement world, and Tom\\ninvented a Wizard Camera which did excellent work. Then came the\\nneed of a powerful light, to enable Uncle Sam\\'s custom officers on\\nthe border to detect the smugglers, and Tom was successful in\\nmaking his apparatus.\\n\\nHe thought he would take a rest after that, but with the opening\\nof the Panama Canal came the need of powerful guns to protect that\\nimportant waterway, and Tom made a Giant Cannon, which enabled the\\nlongest shots on record to be fired.\\n\\nNow, some months had passed, after the successful trial of the big\\nweapon, and Tom longed for new activities. He found them in the\\nidea of a photo telephone, and he and his father were just talking\\nof this when interrupted by the accident to the birdman on the\\nroof of the Swift home.\\n\\n\"Have you got that ladder, Rad?\" cried the young inventor,\\nanxiously, as he saw the dangerous position of the man from the\\nairship.\\n\\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom! I\\'se a-camin\\' wif it!\"\\n\\n\"And where\\'s Koku? We\\'ll need him!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a-camin\\', too!\"\\n\\n\"Here Koku!\" exclaimed a deep voice, and a big man came running\\naround the corner of the house. \"What is it, Master?\"\\n\\n\"We must get him down, Koku!\" said Tom, simply. \"I will go up on\\nthe roof. You had better come, too. Rad, go in the house and get a\\nmattress from the bed. Put it down on the ground where he\\'s likely\\nto fall. Lively now!\"\\n\\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom!\"\\n\\n\"Me git my own ladder--dat one not strong \\'nuff!\" grunted Koku,\\nwho did not speak very good English. He had a very strong ladder,\\nof his own make, built to hold his enormous bulk, and this he soon\\nbrought and placed against the side of the house.\\n\\nMeanwhile Tom and his father had raised the one Eradicate had\\nbrought, though Tom did most of the lifting, for his father was\\nelderly, and had once suffered from heart trouble.\\n\\n\"We\\'re coming for you!\" cried the young inventor as he began to\\nascend the ladder, at the same time observing that the giant was\\ncoming with his. \"Can you hold on a little longer?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I guess so. But I dare not move for fear the propellers will\\nstrike me.\"\\n\\n\"I see. I\\'ll soon shut off the motor,\" said Tom. \"What happened,\\nanyhow?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I was flying over your house. I was on my way to pay you a\\nvisit, but I didn\\'t intend to do it in just this way,\" and the\\nbirdman smiled grimly. \"I didn\\'t see your wireless aerials until I\\nwas plumb into them, and then it was too late. I hope I haven\\'t\\ndamaged them any.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they are easily fixed,\" said Tom. \"I hope you and your\\nbiplane are not damaged. This way, Koku!\" he called to the giant.\\n\\n\"Say, is--is he real, or am I seeing things?\" asked the aviator,\\nas he looked at the big man.\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s real, all right,\" laughed Tom. \"Now, then, I\\'m going to\\nshut off your motor, and then you can quit hugging that chimney,\\nand come down.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be real glad to,\" said the birdman.\\n\\nMaking his way cautiously along the gutters of the roof, Tom\\nmanaged to reach the motor controls. He pulled out the electrical\\nswitch, and with a sort of cough and groan the motor stopped. The\\nbig propellers ceased revolving, and the aviator could leave his\\nperch in safety.\\n\\nThis he did, edging along until he could climb down and meet Tom,\\nwho stood near the ladder.\\n\\n\"Much obliged,\" said the birdman, as he shook hands with Tom. \"My\\nname is Grant Halling. I\\'m a newcomer in Mansburg,\" he added,\\nnaming a town not far from Shopton. \"I know you by reputation, so\\nyou don\\'t need to introduce yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Glad to meet you,\" said the young inventor, cordially. \"Rather a\\nqueer place to meet a friend,\" he went on with a laugh and a\\nglance down to the ground. \"Can you climb?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I\\'m used to that. The next thing will be to get my\\nmachine down.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we can manage that with Koku\\'s help,\" spoke Tom. \"Koku, get\\nsome ropes, and see what you and Rad can do toward getting the\\naeroplane down,\" he added to the giant. \"Let me know if you need\\nany help.\"\\n\\n\"Me can do!\" exclaimed the big man. \"Me fix him!\"\\n\\nTom and Mr. Halling made their way down the ladder, while the\\ngiant proceeded to study out a plan for getting the airship off\\nthe roof.\\n\\n\"You say you were coming over to see me, when you ran into my\\nwireless aerials?\" asked Tom, curiously, when he had introduced\\nhis father to the birdman.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" went on Mr. Halling. \"I have been having some trouble with\\nmy motor, and I thought perhaps you could tell me what was wrong.\\nMy friend, Mr. Wakefield Damon, sent me to you.\"\\n\\n\"What! Do you know Mr. Damon?\" cried Tom.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve known\\' him for some years. I met him in the West, but I\\nhadn\\'t seen him lately, until I came East. He sent me to see you,\\nand said you would help me.\"\\n\\n\"Well, any friend of Mr. Damon\\'s is a friend of mine!\" exclaimed\\nTom, genially. \"I\\'ll have a look at your machine as soon as Koku\\ngets it down. How is Mr. Damon, anyhow? I haven\\'t seen him in over\\ntwo weeks.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry to say he isn\\'t very well, Mr. Swift.\"\\n\\n\"Is he ill? What is the trouble?\"\\n\\n\"He isn\\'t exactly ill,\" went on Mr. Halling, \"but he is fretting\\nhimself into a sickness, worrying over his lost fortune.\"\\n\\n\"His lost fortune!\" cried Tom, in surprise at the bad news\\nconcerning his friend. \"I didn\\'t know he had lost his money!\"\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t yet, but he\\'s in a fair way to, he says. It\\'s something\\nabout bad investments, and he did speak of the trickery of one\\nman, I didn\\'t get the particulars. But he certainly feels very\\nbadly over it.\"\\n\\n\"I should think he would,\" put in Mr. Swift. \"Tom, we must look\\ninto this. If we can help Mr. Damon--\"\\n\\n\"We certainly will,\" interrupted Tom. \"Now come in the house, Mr.\\nHalling. I\\'m sure you must be quite shaken up by your upset.\"\\n\\n\"I am, to tell you the truth, though it isn\\'t the first accident\\nI\\'ve had in my airship.\"\\n\\nThey were proceeding toward the house, when there came a cry from\\nKoku, who had fastened a rope about the airship to lower it.\\n\\n\"Master! Master!\" cried the giant. \"The rope am slippin\\'. Grab the\\nend of it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nTOM\\'S FAILURE\\n\\n\\n\"Come on!\" cried Tom, quickly, as, turning, he saw the accident\\nabout to happen. \"Your craft will surely be smashed if she slips\\nto the ground, Mr. Halling!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right! This seems to be my unlucky day!\" The birdman,\\nlimping slightly from his fall, hurried with Tom to where a rope\\ntrailed on the ground. Koku had fastened one end to the airship,\\nand had taken a turn of the cable about the chimney. He had been\\nlowering the biplane to the ground, but he had not allowed for its\\ngreat weight, and the rope had slipped from his big hands.\\n\\nBut Tom and Mr. Halling were just in time. They grabbed the\\nslipping hempen strands, and thus checked the falling craft until\\nKoku could get a better grip.\\n\\n\"All right now,\" said the giant, when he had made fast the rope.\\n\"Me fix now. Master can go.\"\\n\\n\"Think he can lower it?\" asked Mr. Halling, doubtfully.\\n\\n\"Oh, surely,\" said Tom. \"Koku\\'s as strong as a horse. You needn\\'t\\nworry. He\\'ll get it down all right. But you are limping.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I jammed my leg a little.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want a doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, not for a little thing like that.\"\\n\\nBut Tom insisted on looking at his new friend\\'s wound, and found\\nquite a cut on the thigh, which the young inventor insisted on\\nbinding up.\\n\\n\"That feels better,\" said the birdman, as he stretched out on a\\ncouch. \"Now if you can look my machine over, and tell me what\\'s\\nthe matter with it, I\\'ll be much obliged to you, and I\\'ll get on\\nmy way.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so fast as that!\" laughed Tom. \"I wouldn\\'t want to see\\nyou start off with your lame leg, and certainly I would not want\\nto see you use your aircraft after what she\\'s gone through, until\\nwe\\'ve given her a test. You can\\'t tell what part you might have\\nstrained.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose you are right. But I think I\\'d better go to a\\nhotel, or send for an auto and go home.\"\\n\\n\"Now you needn\\'t do anything of the kind,\" spoke Tom, hospitably.\\n\"We\\'ve got lots of room here, and for that matter we have plenty\\nof autos and airships, too, as well as a motor boat. You just rest\\nyourself here. Later we\\'ll look over your craft.\"\\n\\nAfter dinner, when Mr. Halling said he felt much better, Tom\\nagreed to go out with him and look at the airship. As he feared,\\nhe found several things the matter with it, in addition to the\\nmotor trouble which had been the cause for Mr. Halling\\'s call on\\nthe young inventor.\\n\\n\"Can she be fixed?\" asked the birdman, who explained that, as yet,\\nhe was only an amateur in the practice of flying.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, we can fix her up for you,\" said Tom. \"But it will take\\nseveral days. You\\'ll have to leave it here.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll be glad to do that, for I know she will be all the\\nbetter when you get through with her. But I think I am able to go\\non home now, and I really ought to. There is some business I must\\nattend to.\"\\n\\n\"Speaking of business,\" remarked Tom, \"can you tell me anything\\nmore of Mr. Damon\\'s financial troubles?\"\\n\\n\"No, not much. All I know is that when I called on him the other\\nday I found him with his check book out, and he was doing a lot of\\nfiguring. He looked pretty blue and downcast, I can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry about that,\" spoke Tom, musingly. \"Mr. Damon is a very\\ngood friend of mine, and I\\'d do anything to help him. I certainly\\nwouldn\\'t like to see him lose his fortune. Bad investments, you\\nsay it was?\"\\n\\n\"Partly so, and yet I\\'m inclined to think if he does lose his\\nmoney it will be due to some trickery. Mr. Damon is not the man to\\nmake bad investments by himself.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed he is not,\" agreed Tom. \"You say he spoke of some man?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but not definitely. He did not mention any name. But Mr.\\nDamon was certainly quite blue.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s unlike him,\" remarked Tom. \"He is usually very jolly. He\\nmust be feeling quite badly. I\\'ll go over and have a talk with\\nhim, as soon as I can.\"\\n\\n\"Do. I think he would appreciate it. And now I must see about\\ngetting home.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take you in one of my cars,\" said Tom, who had several\\nautomobiles. \"I don\\'t want to see you strain that injured leg of\\nyours.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re very good--especially after I tangled up your wireless\\naerials; but I didn\\'t see them until I was right into them,\"\\napologized Mr. Halling.\\n\\n\"They\\'re a new kind of wire,\" said Tom, \"and are not very plain to\\nsee. I must put up some warning signs. But don\\'t worry about\\ndamaging them. They were only up temporarily anyhow, and I was\\ngoing to take them down to arrange for my photo telephone.\"\\n\\n\"Photo telephone, eh? Is that something new?\"\\n\\n\"It will be--if I can get it working,\" said Tom, with a smile.\\n\\nA little later Tom had taken Mr. Halling home, and then he set\\nabout making arrangements for repairing the damaged airship. This\\ntook him the better part of a week, but he did not regret the\\ntime, for while he was working he was busy making plans for his\\nnewest invention--the photo telephone.\\n\\nOne afternoon, when Tom had completed the repairs to the airship,\\nand had spent some time setting up an experimental telephone line,\\nthe young inventor received a call from his chum, Ned Newton.\\n\\n\"Well, well, what are you up to now?\" asked Ned, as he saw his\\nchum seated in a booth, with a telephone receiver to his ear,\\nmeanwhile looking steadily at a polished metal plate in front of\\nhim. \"Trying to hypnotize yourself, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Not exactly. Quiet, Ned, please. I\\'m trying to listen.\"\\n\\nNed was too familiar with his chum\\'s work to take offense at this.\\nThe young banker took a seat on a box, and silently watched Tom.\\nThe inventor shifted several switches, pressed one button after\\nanother, and tilted the polished metal plate at different angles.\\nThen he closed the door of the little telephone booth, and Ned,\\nthrough the ground glass door, saw a light shining.\\n\\n\"I wonder what new game Tom is up to?\" Ned mused.\\n\\nPresently the door opened, and Tom stuck out his head.\\n\\n\"Ned, come here,\" he invited. \"Look at that metal plate and see if\\nyou can notice anything on it. I\\'ve been staring at it so steadily\\nthat my eyes are full of sticks. See what you can make out.\"\\n\\n\"What is this?\" asked Ned. \"No trick; is it? I won\\'t be blown up,\\nor get my eyes full of pepper; will I?\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense! Of course not. I\\'m trying to make a photo telephone. I\\nhave the telephone part down pat, but I can\\'t see anything of the\\nphoto image. See if you can.\"\\n\\nNed stared at the polished plate, while Tom did things to it,\\nmaking electrical connections, and tilting it at various angles.\\n\\n\"See anything, Ned?\" asked Tom.\\n\\nThe other shook his head.\\n\\n\"Whom am I supposed to see?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Why, Koku is at the other end of the wire. I\\'m having him help\\nme.\"\\n\\nNed gazed from the polished plate out of a side window of the\\nshop, into the yard.\\n\\n\"Well, that Koku is certainly a wonderful giant,\" said Ned, with a\\nlaugh.\\n\\n\"How so?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Why he can not be in two places at once. You say he ought to be\\nat the other end of this wire, and there he is out there, spading\\nup the garden.\"\\n\\nTom stared for a second and then exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Well, if that isn\\'t the limit! I put him in the telephone booth\\nin the machine shop, and told him to stay there until I was\\nthrough. What in the world is he doing out there?\"\\n\\n\"Koku!\" he called to the giant, \"why didn\\'t you stay at the\\ntelephone where I put you? Why did you run away?\"\\n\\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the giant, who, for all his great size was a\\nsimple chap, \"little thing go \\'tick-tick\\' and then \\'clap-clap!\\'\\nKoku no like--Koku t\\'ink bad spirit in telumfoam--Koku come out!\"\\n\\n\"Well, no wonder I couldn\\'t see any image on the plate!\" exclaimed\\nTom. \"There was nobody there. Now, Ned, you try it; will you,\\nplease?\"\\n\\n\"Sure. Anything to oblige!\"\\n\\n\"Then go in the other telephone booth. You can talk to me on the\\nwire. Say anything you like--the telephone part is all right. Then\\nyou just stand so that the light in the booth shines on your face.\\nThe machine will do the rest--if it works.\"\\n\\nNed hurried off and was soon talking to his chum over the wire\\nfrom the branch telephone in the machine shop. Ned stood in the\\nglare of an electric light, and looked at a polished plate similar\\nto the one in the other booth.\\n\\n\"Are you there, Ned?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m here.\"\\n\\n\"Is the light on?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"And you\\'re looking at the plate?\"\\n\\n\"Sure. Can you see any reflection in your plate?\"\\n\\n\"No, not a thing,\" answered Tom, and there was great\\ndiscouragement in his voice. \"The thing is a failure, Ned. Come on\\nback,\" and the young banker could hear his chum hang up the\\ntelephone receiver at the other end.\\n\\n\"That\\'s too bad,\" murmured Ned, knowing how Tom must feel. \"I\\'ll\\nhave to cheer him up a bit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nRUN DOWN\\n\\n\\nWhen Ned Newton got back to where Tom sat in the small telephone\\nbooth, the young banker found his chum staring rather moodily at\\nthe polished metal plate on the shelf that held the talking\\ninstrument.\\n\\n\"So it was no go; eh, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"No go at all, Ned, and I thought sure I had it right this time.\"\\n\\n\"Then this isn\\'t your first experiment?\"\\n\\n\"Land no! I\\'ve been at it, off and on, for over a month, and I\\ncan\\'t seem to get any farther. I\\'m up against a snag now, good and\\nhard.\"\\n\\n\"Then there wasn\\'t any image on your plate?\"\\n\\n\"Not a thing, Ned. I don\\'t suppose you caught any glimpse of me in\\nyour plate?\" asked Tom, half hopefully.\\n\\n\"No. I couldn\\'t see a thing. So you are going to try and make this\\nthing work both ways, are you?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my intention, But I can fix it so that a person can\\ncontrol the apparatus at his end, and only see the person he is\\ntalking to, not being seen himself, unless he wishes it. That is,\\nI hope to do that. Just now nobody can see anybody,\" and Tom\\nsighed.\\n\\n\"Give it up,\" advised Ned. \"It\\'s too hard a nut to crack, Tom!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, I\\'ll not give it up, Ned! I\\'m going to work along a new\\nline. I must try a different solution of selenium on the metal\\nplate. Perhaps I may have to try using a sensitized plate, and\\ndevelop it later, though I do want to get the machine down so you\\ncan see a perfect image without the need of developing. And I\\nwill, too!\" cried Tom. \"I\\'ll get some new selenium.\"\\n\\nEradicate, who came into the shop just then, heard the end of\\nTom\\'s remarks. A strange look came over his honest black face, and\\nhe exclaimed:\\n\\n\"What all am dat, Massa Tom? Yo\\'ah gwine t\\' bring de new millenium\\nheah? Dat\\'s de end of de world, ain\\'t it-dat millenium? Golly!\\nDish yeah coon neber \\'spected t\\' lib t\\' see dat. De millenium! Oh\\nmah landy!\"\\n\\n\"No, Rad!\" laughed Tom. \"I was speaking about selenium, a sort of\\nmetallic combination that is a peculiar conductor of electricity.\\nThe more light that shines on it the better conductor it is, and\\nthe less light, the poorer.\"\\n\\n\"It must be queer stuff,\" said Ned.\\n\\n\"It is,\" declared Tom. \"I think it is the only thing to use in\\nthis photo telephone experiment, though I might try the metal\\nplate method, as they did between Monte Carlo and Paris. But I am\\nnot trying to make newspaper pictures.\"\\n\\n\"What is selenium, anyhow?\" asked Ned. \"Remember, Tom, I\\'m not up\\non this scientific stuff as you are.\"\\n\\n\"Selenium,\" went on Tom, \"was discovered in 1817, by J. J.\\nBerzelius, and he gave it that name from the Greek word for moon,\\non account of selenium being so similar, in some ways, to\\ntellurium. That last is named after the Latin word tellus, the\\nearth.\"\\n\\n\"Do they dig it?\" Ned wanted to know.\\n\\n\"Well, sometimes selenium is found in combination with metals, in\\nthe form of selenides, the more important minerals of that kind\\nbeing eucharite, crooksite, clausthalite, naumannite and zorgite--\"\\n\\n\"Good night!\" interrupted Ned, with a laugh, holding up his hands.\\n\"Stop it, Tom!\" he pleaded. \"You\\'ll give me a headache with all\\nthose big words.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, they\\'re easy, once you get used to them,\" said the young\\ninventor, with a smile. \"Perhaps it will be easier if I say that\\nsometimes selenium is found in native sulphur. Selenium is usually\\nobtained from the flue-dust or chamber deposits of some factory\\nwhere sulphuric acid is made. They take this dust and treat it\\nwith acids until they get the pure selenium. Sometimes selenium\\ncomes in crystal forms, and again it is combined with various\\nmetals for different uses.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s one good thing about it. There are several varieties, and\\nI\\'ll try them all before I give up.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the way to talk!\" cried Ned. \"Never say die! Don\\'t give up\\nthe ship, and all that. But, Tom, what you need now is a little\\nfun. You\\'ve been poking away at this too long. Come on out on the\\nlake, and have a ride in the motor boat. It will do you good. It\\nwill do me good. I\\'m a bit rusty myself--been working hard lately.\\nCome on--let\\'s go out on the lake.\"\\n\\n\"I believe I will!\" exclaimed Tom, after thinking it over for a\\nmoment. \"I need a little fresh air. Sitting in that telephone\\nbooth, trying to get an image on a plate, and not succeeding, has\\ngotten on my nerves. I want to write out an order for Koku to take\\nto town, though. I want to get some fresh selenium, and then I\\'m\\ngoing to make new plates.\"\\n\\nTom made some memoranda, and then, giving Koku the order for the\\nchemist, the young inventor closed up his shop, and went with Ned\\ndown to Lake Carlopa, where the motor boat was moored.\\n\\nThis was not the same boat Tom had first purchased, some years\\nago, but a comparatively new and powerful craft.\\n\\n\"It sure is one grand little day for a ride,\" remarked Ned, as he\\ngot in the craft, while Tom looked over the engine.\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m glad you came over, and routed me out,\" said the young\\ninventor. \"When I get going on a thing I don\\'t know enough to\\nstop. Oh, I forgot something!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"I forgot to leave word about Mr. Railing\\'s airship. It\\'s all\\nfixed and ready for him, but I put on a new control, and I wanted\\nto explain to him about it. He might not know how to work it. I\\nleft word with father, though, that if he came for it he must not\\ntry it until he had seen me. I guess it will be all right. I don\\'t\\nwant to go back to the house now.\"\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s too far,\" agreed Ned.\\n\\n\"I have it!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I\\'ll telephone to dad from here, not\\nto let Halling go up until I come back. He may not come for his\\nmachine; but, if he does, it\\'s best to be on the safe side Ned.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, sure.\"\\n\\nAccordingly, Tom \\'phoned from his boat-house, and Mr. Swift\\npromised to see the bird-man if he called. Then Ned and Tom gave\\nthemselves up to the delights of a trip on the water.\\n\\nThe Kilo, which name Tom had selected for his new craft, was a\\npowerful boat, and comfortable. It swept on down the lake, and\\nmany other persons, in their pleasure craft, turned to look at\\nTom\\'s fine one.\\n\\n\"Lots of folks out to-day,\" observed Ned, as they went around a\\npoint of the shore.\\n\\n\"Yes, quite a number,\" agreed Tom, leaning forward to adjust the\\nmotor. \"I wonder what\\'s got into her?\" he said, in some annoyance,\\nas he made various adjustments. \"One of the cylinders is missing.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe it needs a new spark plug,\" suggested Ned.\\n\\n\"Maybe. Guess I\\'ll stop and put one in.\"\\n\\nTom slowed down the motor, and headed his boat over toward shore,\\nintending to tie up there for a while.\\n\\nAs he shifted the wheel he heard a cry behind him, and at the same\\ntime a hoarse, domineering voice called out:\\n\\n\"Here, what do you mean, changing your course that way? Look out,\\nor I\\'ll run you down! Get out of my way, you land-lubber, you!\"\\n\\nStartled, Ned and Tom turned. They saw, rushing up on them from\\nastern, a powerful red motor boat, at the wheel of which sat a\\nstout man, with a very florid face and a commanding air.\\n\\n\"Get out of my way!\" he cried. \"I can\\'t stop so short! Look out,\\nor I\\'ll run you down!\"\\n\\nTom, with a fierce feeling of resentment at the fellow, was about\\nto shift the course of the Kilo, but he was too late.\\n\\nA moment later there came a smashing blow on the stern port\\nquarter and the Kilo heeled over at a dangerous angle, while, with\\na rending, splintering sound of wood, the big red motorboat swept\\non past Tom and Ned, her rubstreak grinding along the side of the\\nKilo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nSHARP WORDS\\n\\n\\n\"Great Scott, Tom! What happened?\"\\n\\n\"I know as much as you, Ned. That fellow ran us down, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\"Are we leaking?\" and with this question Ned sprang from his place\\nnear the bow, and looked toward the stern, where the heaviest blow\\nhad been struck.\\n\\nThe Kilo had swung back to an even keel again, but was still\\nbobbing about on the water.\\n\\n\"Any hole there?\" cried Tom, as he swung the wheel over to point\\nhis craft toward shore, in case she showed a tendency to sink.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see any hole,\" answered Ned. \"But water is coming in\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\"Then there\\'s a leak all right! Probably some of the seams are\\nopened, or it may be coming in around the shaft stuffing-box.\\nHere, Ned, take the wheel, and I\\'ll start up the engine again,\"\\nfor with the blow the motor had stopped.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Ned, as he again made his way\\nforward.\\n\\n\"Take her to shore, of course. It\\'s deep out here and I don\\'t want\\nher to go down at this point.\"\\n\\n\"Say, what do you think of that fellow, anyhow, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t like to tell you. Look, he\\'s coming back.\"\\n\\nThis was so, for, as the boys watched, the big red motor boat had\\nswung about in a circle and was headed for them.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell him what I think of him, at any rate,\" murmured Tom, as\\nhe bent over his motor. \"And, later on, I\\'ll let the lawyers talk\\nto him.\"\\n\\n\"You mean you\\'ll sue him, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m certainly not going to let him run into me and spring a\\nleak, for nothing. That won\\'t go with me!\"\\n\\nBy this time Tom had the motor started, but he throttled it down\\nso that it just turned the propeller. With it running at full\\nspeed there was considerable vibration, and this would further\\nopen the leaking seams. So much water might thus be let in that\\nthe craft could not be gotten ashore.\\n\\n\"Head her over, Ned,\" cried Tom, when he found he had sufficient\\nheadway. \"Steer for Ramsey\\'s dock. There\\'s a marine railway next\\nto him, and I can haul her out for repairs.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the talk, Tom!\" cried his chum.\\n\\nBy this time the big, red motor boat was close beside Tom\\'s craft.\\n\\nThe man at the wheel, a stout-bodied and stout-faced man, with a\\ncomplexion nearly the color of his boat, glared at the two young\\nmen.\\n\\n\"What do you fellows mean?\" called out the man, in deep booming\\ntones--tones that he tried to make imposing, but which, to the\\ntrained ears of Tom and Ned, sounded only like the enraged bellow\\nof some bully. \"What do you mean, I say? Getting on my course like\\nthat!\"\\n\\nNed could see Tom biting his lips, and clenching his hands to keep\\ndown his temper. But it was too much. To be run into, and then\\ninsulted, was more than Tom could stand.\\n\\n\"Look here!\" he cried, standing up and facing the red-faced man,\\n\"I don\\'t know who you are, and I don\\'t care. But I\\'ll tell you one\\nthing--you\\'ll pay for the damage you did to my boat!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll pay for it? Come, that\\'s pretty good! Ha! Ha!\" laughed the\\nself-important man. \"Why, I was thinking of making a complaint\\nagainst you for crossing my course that way. If I find my boat is\\ndamaged I shall certainly do so anyhow. Have we suffered any\\ndamage, Snuffin?\" and he looked back at a grimy-faced mechinician\\nwho was oiling the big, throbbing motor, which was now running\\nwith the clutch out.\\n\\n\"No, sir, I don\\'t think we\\'re damaged, sir,\" answered the man,\\ndeferentially.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s a lucky thing for these land-lubbers that we aren\\'t. I\\nshould certainly sue them. The idea of crossing my course the way\\nthey did. Weren\\'t they in the wrong, Snuffin?\"\\n\\nThe man hesitated for a moment, and glanced at Tom and Ned, as\\nthough asking their indulgence.\\n\\n\"Well, I asked you a question, Snuffin!\" exclaimed the red-faced\\nman sharply.\\n\\n\"Yes--yes, sir, they shouldn\\'t have turned the way they did,\"\\nanswered the man, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Well, of all the nerve!\" murmured Tom, and stopped his motor.\\nThen, stepping to the side of his disabled and leaking boat, he\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"Look here! Either you folks don\\'t know anything about navigation\\nrules, or you aren\\'t heeding them. I had a perfect right to turn\\nand go ashore when I did, for I found my engine was out of order,\\nand I wanted to fix it. I blew the usual signal on the whistle,\\nshowing my intention to turn off my course, and if you had been\\nlistening you would have heard it.\"\\n\\n\"If you had even been watching you would have seen me shift, and\\nthen, coming on at the speed you did, it was your place to warn me\\nby a whistle, so that I could keep straight on until you had\\npassed me.\"\\n\\n\"But you did not. You kept right on and ran into me, and the only\\nwonder is that you didn\\'t sink me. Talk about me getting in your\\nway! Why, you deliberately ran me down after I had given the right\\nsignal. I\\'ll make a complaint against you, that\\'s what I will.\"\\n\\nIf possible the red-faced man got even more rosy than usual. He\\nfairly puffed up, he was so angry.\\n\\n\"Listen to that, will you, Snuffin!\" he cried. \"Listen to that! He\\nsays he blew his whistle to tell us he was going to turn in.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I did!\" said Tom, calmly.\\n\\n\"Preposterous! Did you hear it, Snuffin?\" puffed the important\\nman.\\n\\n\"Yes--yes, I think I did, sir,\" answered the machinist, in a\\nhesitating voice.\\n\\n\"You did? What! You mean to tell me you heard their whistle?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--yes, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Why--why--er--I--\" the big man puffed and blew, but seemed to\\nfind no words in which to express himself. \"Snuffin, I\\'ll have a\\ntalk with you when we get home,\" he finally said, most significantly.\\n\"The idea of saying you heard a whistle blown! There was nothing of\\nthe kind! I shall make a complaint against these land-lubbers myself.\\nDo you know who they are, Snuffin?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--yes, sir,\" was the answer, as the man glanced at Tom. \"At\\nleast I know one of them, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. Give me his name. I\\'ll attend to the rest.\"\\n\\nTom looked at the big man sharply. He had never seen him before,\\nas far as he could recall. As for the machinist, the young\\ninventor had a dim recollection that once the man might have\\nworked in his shop.\\n\\n\"Go ahead, Snuffin!\" said the big man, mopping his face with a\\nlarge silk handkerchief, which, even at that distance, gave out a\\npowerful perfume. \"Go ahead, Snuffin, and we will settle this\\nmatter later,\" and, adjusting a large rose in his buttonhole, the\\nself-important individual took his place on the cushioned seat at\\nthe wheel, while the big red motor boat drew off down the river.\\n\\n\"Well, of all the nerve!\" gasped Ned. \"Isn\\'t he the limit?\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" spoke Tom, with a little laugh. \"I\\'m sorry I lost my\\ntemper, and even bothered to answer him. We\\'ll let the lawyers do\\nthe rest of the talking. Take the wheel, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"But are you going to let him get away like this, Tom? Without\\nasking him to pay for the damage to your boat, when he was clearly\\nin the wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll ask him to pay all right; but I\\'ll do it the proper way.\\nNow come on. If we stay here chinning much longer the Kilo will go\\ndown. I must find out who he is. I think I know Snuffin--he used\\nto work for me, I now recall.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know who that big man is?\" asked Ned, as he took the\\nwheel, while Tom again started the motor. The water was now almost\\nup to the lower rim of the fly wheel.\\n\\n\"No; who is he?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Shallock Peters.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I know as much as I did before,\" laughed Tom. \"That doesn\\'t\\ntell me anything.\"\\n\\n\"Why, I thought everybody in the town knew Shallock Peters,\" went\\non Ned. \"He tried to do some business with our bank, but was\\nturned down. I hear he\\'s gone to the other one, though. He\\'s what\\nwe call a get-rich-quick schemer, Tom--a promoter.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he acted like that sort of a character.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s what he is. He\\'s got half a dozen schemes under way,\\nand he hasn\\'t been in town over a month. I wonder you haven\\'t seen\\nor heard of him.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been too busy over my photo telephone.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so. Well, this fellow Peters struck Shopton about a\\nmonth ago. He bought the old Wardell homestead, and began to show\\noff at once. He\\'s got two autos, and this big motor boat. He\\nalways goes around with a silk hat and a flower in his buttonhole.\\nA big bluff--that\\'s what he is.\"\\n\\n\"He acted so to me,\" was Tom\\'s comment. \"Well, he isn\\'t going to\\nscare me. The idea! Why, he seemed to think we were in the wrong;\\nwhereas he was, and his man knew it, too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but the poor fellow was afraid to say so. I felt sorry for\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"So did I,\" added Tom. \"Well, Kilo is out of commission for the\\npresent. Guess we\\'ll have to finish our outing by walking, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind. But it makes me mad to have a fellow act the\\nway he did.\"\\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s no good in getting mad,\" was Tom\\'s smiling\\nrejoinder. \"We\\'ll take it out of him legally. That\\'s the best way\\nin the end. But I can\\'t help saying I don\\'t like Mr. Shallock\\nPeters.\"\\n\\n\"And I don\\'t either,\" added Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nA WARNING\\n\\n\\n\"There, she\\'s about right now, Ned. Hold her there!\"\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, Captain Tom!\"\\n\\n\"Jove, she\\'s leaking like a sieve! We only got her here just in\\ntime!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" agreed Ned.\\n\\nTom and his chum had managed to get the Kilo to Ramsey\\'s dock, and\\nover the ways of the inclined marine railway that led from the\\nshop on shore down into the river. Then, poling the craft along,\\nuntil she was in the \"cradle,\" Ned held her there while Tom went\\non shore to wind up the windlass that pulled the car, containing\\nthe boat, up the incline.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give you a hand, as soon as I find she sets level,\" called\\nNed, from his place in the boat.\\n\\n\"All right--don\\'t worry. There are good gears on this windlass,\\nand she works easy,\" replied Tom.\\n\\nIn a short time the boat was out of the water, but, as Tom grimly\\nremarked, \"the water was not out of her,\" for a stream poured from\\nthe stuffing-box, through which the propeller shaft entered, and\\nwater also ran out through the seams that had been opened by the\\ncollision.\\n\\n\"Quite a smash, Tom,\" observed the boat repairer, when he had come\\nout to look over the Kilo. \"How\\'d it happen?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Shallock Peters, with his big red boat, ran into us!\" said\\nNed, sharply.\\n\\n\"Ha, Peters; eh?\" exclaimed the boatman. \"That\\'s the second craft\\nhe\\'s damaged inside a week with his speed mania. There\\'s Bert\\nJohnson\\'s little speeder over there,\" and he pointed to one over\\nwhich some men were working. \"Had to put a whole new stern in her,\\nand what do you think that man Peters did?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Tom, as he bent down to see how much damage his\\ncraft had sustained.\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t pay young Johnson a cent of money for the repairs,\"\\nwent on Mr. Houston, the boatman. \"It was all Peters\\'s fault,\\ntoo.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t he make him pay?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Well, young Johnson asked for it--no more than right, too; but\\nPeters only sneered and laughed at him.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t he sue?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"Costs too much money to hire lawyers, I reckon. So he played you\\nthe same trick; eh, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty much, yes. But he won\\'t get off so easily, I can tell you\\nthat!\" and there was a grim and determined look on the face of the\\nyoung inventor. \"How long will it take to fix my boat, Mr.\\nHouston?\"\\n\\n\"Nigh onto two weeks, Tom. I\\'m terrible rushed now.\"\\n\\nTom whistled ruefully.\\n\\n\"I could do it myself quicker, if I could get her back to my\\nshop,\" he said. \"But she\\'d sink on the home trip. All right, do\\nthe best you can, Mr. Houston.\"\\n\\n\"I will that, Tom.\"\\n\\nThe two chums walked out of the boat-repair place.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do, Tom?\" asked Ned, as they strolled\\nalong.\\n\\n\"Well, since we can\\'t go motor boating, I guess I may as well go\\nback and see if that new supply of selenium has come. I do want to\\nget my photo telephone working, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"And that\\'s all the outing you\\'re going to take--less than an\\nhour!\" exclaimed Ned, reproachfully.\\n\\n\"Oh, well, all you wanted to do was to get me out of a rut, as you\\ncalled it,\" laughed Tom. \"And you\\'ve done it--you and Mr. Peters\\ntogether. It jolted up my brain, and I guess I can think better\\nnow. Come on back and watch me tinker away, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"Not much! I\\'m going to stay out and get some fresh air while I\\ncan. You\\'d better, too.\"\\n\\n\"I will, later.\"\\n\\nSo Tom turned back to his workshop, and Ned strolled on into the\\ncountry, for his day\\'s work at the bank was over. And for some\\ntime after that--until far into the night--Tom Swift worked at the\\nknotty problem of the photo telephone.\\n\\nBut the young inventor was baffled. Try as he might, he could not\\nget the image to show on the metal plate, nor could he get any\\nresults by using a regular photographic plate, and developing it\\nafterward.\\n\\n\"There is something wrong with the transmission of the light waves\\nover the wire,\" Tom confessed to his father.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll never do it, Tom,\" said the aged inventor. \"You are only\\nwasting a whole lot of time.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as I haven\\'t anything else to do now, it isn\\'t much loss,\"\\nspoke Tom, ruefully. \"But I\\'m going to make this work, Dad!\"\\n\\n\"All right, son. It\\'s up to you. Only I tell you it can\\'t be\\ndone.\"\\n\\nTom, himself, was almost ready to admit this, when, a week later,\\nhe seemed to be no nearer a solution of the problem than he was at\\nfirst. He had tried everything he could think of, and he had\\nEradicate and Koku, the giant, almost distracted, by making them\\nstay in small telephone booths for hours at a time, while the\\nyoung inventor tried to get some reflection of one face or the\\nother to come over the wire.\\n\\nKoku finally got so nervous over the matter, that he flatly\\nrefused to \"pose\" any longer, so Tom was forced to use Eradicate.\\nAs for that elderly man of all work, after many trials, all\\nunsuccessful, he remarked:\\n\\n\"Massa Tom, I reckon I knows what\\'s wrong.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Rad? Well, what is it?\"\\n\\n\"Mah face am too black--dat\\'s de trouble. You done want a\\nwhite-complected gen\\'man to stand in dat booth an\\' look at dat lookin\\'\\nglass plate. I\\'se too black! I suah is!\"\\n\\n\"No, that isn\\'t it, Rad,\" laughed Tom, hopelessly. \"If the thing\\nworks at all it will send a black man\\'s face over the wire as well\\nas a white man\\'s. I guess the truth of it is that you\\'re like\\nKoku. You\\'re getting tired. I don\\'t know as I blame you. I\\'m\\ngetting a bit weary myself. I\\'m going to take a rest. I\\'ll send\\nfor another kind of selenium crystals I\\'ve heard of, and we\\'ll try\\nthem. In the meanwhile--I\\'ll take a little vacation.\"\\n\\n\"Get out my small airship, Rad, and I\\'ll take a little flight.\"\\n\\n\"Dat\\'s de way to talk, Massa Tom,\" was the glad rejoinder.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going over to see Mr. Damon, Father,\" announced Tom to Mr.\\nSwift a little later, when his speedy monoplane was waiting for\\nhim. \"I haven\\'t seen him in some time, and I\\'d like to get at the\\ntruth of what Mr. Halling said about Mr. Damon\\'s fortune being in\\ndanger. I\\'ll be back soon.\"\\n\\n\"All right, Tom. And say--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Dad, what is it?\" asked Tom, as he paused in the act of\\ngetting in the seat.\\n\\n\"If he wants any ready cash, you know we\\'ve got plenty.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, sure. I was going to tell him we\\'d help him out.\"\\n\\nThen, as Koku spun the propeller blades, Tom grasped the steering\\nwheel, and, tilting the elevating rudder, he was soon soaring into\\nthe air, he and his craft becoming smaller and smaller as they\\nwere lost to sight in the distance, while the rattle and roar of\\nthe powerful motor became fainter.\\n\\nIn a comparatively short time Tom had made a successful landing in\\nthe big yard in front of Mr. Damon\\'s house, and, walking up the\\npath, kept a lookout for his friend.\\n\\n\"I wonder why he didn\\'t come out to meet me?\" mused Tom, for\\nusually when the eccentric man heard the throbbing of Tom\\'s motor,\\nhe was out waiting for the young inventor. But this time it was\\nnot the case.\\n\\n\"Is Mr. Damon in?\" Tom asked of the maid who answered his ring.\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Swift. You\\'ll find him in the library,\" and she ushered\\nhim in.\\n\\n\"Oh, hello, Tom,\" greeted Mr. Damon, but the tone was so listless,\\nand his friend\\'s manner so gloomy that the young inventor was\\nquite embarrassed.\\n\\n\"Have a chair,\" went on Mr. Damon. \"I\\'ll talk to you in a minute,\\nTom. I\\'ve got to finish this letter, and it\\'s a hard one to write,\\nlet me tell you.\"\\n\\nNow Tom was more astonished than ever. Not once had Mr. Damon\\n\"blessed,\" anything, and when this did not happen Tom was sure\\nsomething was wrong. He waited until his friend had sealed the\\nletter, and turned to him with a sigh. Then Tom said boldly:\\n\\n\"Mr. Damon, is it true that you\\'re having hard luck--in money\\nmatters?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, Tom, I\\'m afraid I am,\" was the quick answer. \"But who\\ntold you?\"\\n\\n\"Grant Halling. He was over to get me to fix his airship,\" and Tom\\nbriefly related what had happened.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I did mention the matter to him,\" went on Mr. Damon, and\\nhis tone was still listless. \"So he told you; did he? Well,\\nmatters aren\\'t any better, Tom. In fact, they\\'re worse. I just had\\nto write to a man who was asking for help, and I had to refuse\\nhim, though he needs it very much. The truth is I hadn\\'t the\\nmoney. Tom, I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to be a very poor man soon.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible, Mr. Damon! Why, I thought your investments--\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve made some bad ones of late, Tom. I\\'ve been pretty foolish,\\nI\\'m afraid. I drew out some money I had in government bonds, and\\ninvested in certain stocks sold by a Mr. Shallock Peters.\"\\n\\n\"Shallock Peters!\" cried Tom, almost jumping out of his chair.\\n\"Why, I know him--I mean I\\'ve met him.\"\\n\\n\"Have you, Tom? Well, then, all I\\'ve got to say is to steer clear\\nof him, my boy. Don\\'t have anything to do with him,\" and, with\\nsomething of a return of his usual energy Mr. Damon banged his\\nfist down on his desk. \"Give him a wide berth, Tom, and if you see\\nhim coming, turn your back. He\\'d talk a miser into giving him his\\nlast cent. Keep away from Shallock Peters, Tom. Bless my necktie,\\nhe\\'s a scoundrel, that\\'s what he is!\" and again Mr. Damon banged\\nhis desk forcibly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nSOFT WORDS\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad of one thing!\" exclaimed Tom, when the ink bottle\\nand the paper cutter on Mr. Damon\\'s desk had ceased rattling,\\nbecause of the violence of the blow. \"I\\'m glad of one thing.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that, Tom?\" asked his friend.\\n\\n\"I heard you bless something at last--the first time since I came\\nin.\"\\n\\n\"Oh!\" and Mr. Damon laughed. \"Well, Tom, I haven\\'t been blessing\\nthings lately--that\\'s a fact. I haven\\'t had the heart for it.\\nThere are too many business complications. I wish I\\'d never met\\nthis Peters.\"\\n\\n\"So do I,\" said Tom. \"My motor boat would not have been damaged\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"Did he do that, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"He certainly did, and then he accused me of being at fault.\"\\n\\n\"That would be just like him. Tell me about it, Tom.\"\\n\\nWhen the young inventor finished the story of the collision Mr.\\nDamon sat silent for a moment. Then he remarked slowly:\\n\\n\"That\\'s just like Peters. A big bluff--that\\'s what he is. I wish\\nI\\'d discovered that fact sooner--I\\'d be money in pocket. But I\\nallowed myself to be deceived by his talk about big profits. At\\nfirst he seemed like a smart business man, and he certainly had\\nfine recommendations. But I am inclined to believe, now, that the\\nrecommendations were forged.\"\\n\\n\"What did he do to you, Mr. Damon?\" asked Tom, with ready\\nsympathy.\\n\\n\"It\\'s too complicated to go into details over, Tom, but to make a\\nlong story short, he got me to invest nearly all my fortune in\\nsome enterprises that, I fear, are doomed to failure. And if they\\ndo fail, I\\'ll be a ruined man.\"\\n\\n\"No, you won\\'t!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That\\'s one reason why I came here\\nto-day. Father told me to offer you all the ready money you needed\\nto get out of your trouble. How much do you need, Mr. Damon?\"\\n\\n\"Bless my collar button! That\\'s like your father, Tom,\" and now\\nMr. Damon seemed more like his old self. \"Bless my shoes, a man\\nnever knows who his real friends are until trouble comes. I can\\'t\\nsay how I thank you and your father, Tom. But I\\'m not going to\\ntake advantage of him.\"\\n\\n\"It wouldn\\'t be taking any advantage of him, Mr. Damon. He has\\nmoney lying idle, and he\\'d like to have you use it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, I might use it, if I had only myself to think about.\\nBut there\\'s no use in throwing good money after bad. If I took\\nyours now this fellow Peters would only get it, and that would be\\nthe last of it.\"\\n\\n\"No, Tom, thank you and your father just the same, but I\\'ll try to\\nweather the storm a bit longer myself. Then, if I do go down I\\nwon\\'t drag anybody else with me. I\\'ll hang on to the wreck a bit\\nlonger. The storm may blow over, or--or something may happen to\\nthis fellow Peters.\"\\n\\n\"Has he really got you in his grip, Mr. Damon?\"\\n\\n\"He has, and, to a certain extent, it\\'s my own fault. I should\\nhave been suspicious of him. And now, Tom, let me give you a\\nfurther word of warning. You heard me say to steer clear of this\\nPeters?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and I\\'m going to. But I\\'m going to make him pay for damaging\\nmy boat, if I possibly can.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe it would be wiser not to try that, Tom. I tell you he\\'s a\\ntricky man. And one thing more. I have heard that this man Peters\\nmakes a specialty of organizing companies to take up new\\ninventions.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" asked Tom, interestedly.\\n\\n\"Yes, but that\\'s as far as it goes. Peters gets the invention, and\\nthe man, out of whose brain it came, gets nothing.\"\\n\\n\"In other words, he swindles them?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, Tom. If not in one way, then in another. He cheats\\nthem out of the profits of their inventions. So I want to warn you\\nto be on the lookout.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" said Tom. \"Peters will get nothing from my father\\nor me. We\\'ll be on our guard. Not that I think he will try it, but\\nit\\'s just as well to be warned. I didn\\'t like him from the moment\\nhe ran into me, and, now that I know what he has done to you, I\\nlike him still less. He won\\'t get anything from me!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad to hear you say so, Tom. I wish he\\'d gotten nothing out\\nof me.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure you won\\'t let my father help you, financially, Mr.\\nDamon?\"\\n\\n\"No, Tom, at least not for the present. I\\'m going to make another\\nfight to hold on to my fortune. If I find I can\\'t do it alone,\\nthen I\\'ll call on you. I\\'m real glad you called. Bless my\\nshoestring! I feel better now.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad of it,\" laughed Tom, and he saw that his friend was in a\\nbetter state of mind, as his \"blessings\" showed.\\n\\nTom remained for a little longer, talking to Mr. Damon, and then\\ntook his leave, flying back home in the airship.\\n\\n\"Gen\\'man t\\' see yo\\', Massa Tom,\" announced Eradicate, as he helped\\nTom wheel the monoplane back into the shed.\\n\\n\"Is that so, Rad? Where is he?\"\\n\\n\"Settin\\' in th\\' library. Yo\\' father am out, so I asted him in\\ndere.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right, Rad. Who is he, do you know?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom, I doan\\'t. He shore does use a pow\\'ful nice\\nperfume on his pocket hanky, though. Yum-yum!\"\\n\\n\"Perfume!\" exclaimed Tom, his mind going back to the day he had\\nhad the trouble with Mr. Peters. \"Is he a big, red-faced man,\\nRad?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom. He\\'s a white-faced, skinny man.\"\\n\\n\"Then it can\\'t be Peters,\" mused Tom. \"I guess perhaps it\\'s that\\nlawyer I wrote to about bringing suit to get back what it cost me\\nto have the Kilo fixed. I\\'ll see him at once. Oh, by the way, it\\nisn\\'t Mr. Grant Halling; is it? The gentleman who got tangled up\\nin our aerials with his airship? Is it he?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom. \\'Tain\\'t him.\"\\n\\n\"I thought perhaps he had gotten into more trouble,\" mused Tom, as\\nhe took off his airship \"togs,\" and started for the house. For Mr.\\nHalling had called for his repaired airship some time ago, and had\\npromised to pay Tom another and more conventional visit, some\\nfuture day.\\n\\nTom did not know the visitor whom he greeted in the library a\\nlittle later. The man, as Eradicate had said, was rather pale of\\nface, and certainly he was not very fleshy.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tom Swift, I think?\" said the man, rising and holding out his\\nhand.\\n\\n\"That\\'s my name. I don\\'t believe I know you, though.\"\\n\\n\"No, I haven\\'t your reputation,\" said the man, with a laugh that\\nTom did not like. \"We can\\'t all be great inventors like you,\" and,\\nsomehow, Tom liked the man less than before, for he detected an\\nundertone of sneering patronage in the words. Tom disliked praise,\\nand he felt that this was not sincere.\\n\\n\"I have called on a little matter of business,\" went on the man.\\n\"My name is Harrison Boylan, and I represent Mr. Shallock Peters.\"\\n\\nInstinctively Tom stiffened. Receiving a call from a\\nrepresentative of the man against whom Mr. Damon had warned him\\nonly a short time before was a strange coincidence, Tom thought.\\n\\n\"You had some little accident, when your motor boat and that of\\nMr. Peters collided, a brief time ago; did you not?\" went on Mr.\\nBoylan.\\n\\n\"I did,\" said Tom, and, as he motioned the caller to be seated Tom\\nsaw, with a start, that some of the drawings of his photo\\ntelephone were lying on a desk in plain sight. They were within\\neasy reach of the man, and Tom thought the sheets looked as though\\nthey had been recently handled. They were not in the orderly array\\nTom had made of them before going out.\\n\\n\"If he is a spy, and has been looking at them,\" mused Tom, \"he may\\nsteal my invention.\" Then he calmed himself, as he realized that\\nhe, himself, had not yet perfected his latest idea. \"I guess he\\ncouldn\\'t make much of the drawings,\" Tom thought.\\n\\n\"Yes, the collision was most unfortunate,\" went on Mr. Boylan,\\n\"and Mr. Peters has instructed me to say--\"\\n\\n\"If he\\'s told you to say that it was my fault, you may as well\\nsave your time,\" cut in Tom. \"I don\\'t want to be impolite, but I\\nhave my own opinion of the affair. And I might add that I have\\ninstructed a lawyer to begin a suit against Mr. Peters--\"\\n\\n\"No necessity for that at all!\" interrupted the man, in soft\\naccents. \"No necessity at all. I am sorry you did that, for there\\nwas no need. Mr. Peters has instructed me to say that he realizes\\nthe accident was entirely his own fault, and he is very willing--nay,\\nanxious, to pay all damages. In fact, that is why I am here,\\nand I am empowered, my dear Mr. Swift, to offer you five hundred\\ndollars, to pay for the repairs to your motor boat. If that is not\\nenough--\"\\n\\nThe man paused, and drew a thick wallet from his pocket. Tom felt\\na little embarrassed over what he had said.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" spoke the young inventor, \"the repair bill is only about\\nthree hundred dollars. I\\'m sorry--\"\\n\\n\"Now that\\'s all right, Mr. Swift! It\\'s all right,\" and the man,\\nwith his soft words, raised a white, restraining hand. \"Not\\nanother word. Mr. Peters did not know who you were that day he so\\nunfortunately ran into you. If he had, he would not have spoken as\\nhe did. He supposed you were some amateur motor-boatist, and he\\nwas--well, he admits it--he was provoked.\"\\n\\n\"Since then he has made inquiries, and, learning who you were, he\\nat once authorized me to make a settlement in full. So if five\\nhundred dollars--\"\\n\\n\"The repair bill,\" said Tom, and his voice was not very cordial,\\nin spite of the other\\'s persuasive smile, \"the bill came to three\\nhundred forty-seven dollars. Here is the receipted bill. I paid\\nit, and, to be frank with you, I intended bringing suit against\\nMr. Peters for that sum.\"\\n\\n\"No need, no need at all, I assure you!\" interrupted Mr. Boylan,\\nas he counted off some bills. \"There you are, and I regret that\\nyou and Mr. Peters had such a misunderstanding. It was all his\\nfault, and he wants to apologize to you.\"\\n\\n\"The apology is accepted,\" said Tom, and he smiled a trifle. \"Also\\nthe money. I take it merely as a matter of justice, for I assure\\nyou that Mr. Peters\\'s own machinist will say the accident was his\\nemployer\\'s fault.\"\\n\\n\"No doubt of it, not the least in the world,\" said the caller.\\n\"And now that I have this disagreeable business over, let me speak\\nof something more pleasant.\"\\n\\nInstinctively Tom felt that now the real object of the man\\'s call\\nwould be made plain--that the matter of paying the damages was\\nonly a blind. Tom steeled himself for what was to come.\\n\\n\"You know, I suppose,\" went on Mr. Boylan, smiling at Tom, \"that\\nMr. Peters is a man of many and large interests.\"\\n\\n\"I have heard something like that,\" said Tom, cautiously.\\n\\n\"Yes. Well, he is an organizer--a promoter, if you like. He\\nsupplies the money for large enterprises, and is, therefore, a\\nbenefactor of the human race. Where persons have no cash with\\nwhich to exploit their--well, say their inventions. Mr. Peters\\ntakes them, and makes money out of them.\"\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" thought Tom, grimly.\\n\\n\"In other cases, where an inventor is working at a handicap, say\\nwith too many interests, Mr. Peters takes hold of one of his\\nideas, and makes it pay much better than the inventor has been\\nable to do.\"\\n\\n\"Now, Mr. Peters has heard of you, and he would like to do you\\ngood.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I guess he would,\" thought Tom. \"He would like to do me--and\\ndo me good and brown. Here\\'s where I\\'ve got to play a game\\nmyself.\"\\n\\n\"And so,\" went on Mr. Boylan, \"Mr. Peters has sent me to you to\\nask you to allow him to exploit one, or several, of your\\ninventions. He will form a large stock company, put one of your\\ninventions on the market, and make you a rich man. Now what do you\\nsay?\" and he looked at Tom and smiled--smiled, the young inventor\\ncould not help thinking, like a cat looking at a mouse. \"What do\\nyou say, Mr. Swift?\"\\n\\nFor a moment Tom did not answer. Then getting up and opening the\\nlibrary door, to indicate that the interview was at an end, the\\nyoung inventor smiled, and said:\\n\\n\"Tell Mr. Peters that I thank him, but that I have nothing for him\\nto exploit, or with which to form a company to market.\"\\n\\n\"Wha--what!\" faltered the visitor. \"Do you mean to say you will\\nnot take advantage of his remarkable offer?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just what I mean to say,\" replied Tom, with a smile.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t do business with Mr. Peters? You won\\'t let him do you\\ngood?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Tom, quietly.\\n\\n\"Why--why, that\\'s the strangest--the most preposterous thing I\\never heard of!\" protested Mr. Boylan. \"What--what shall I say to\\nMr. Peters?\"\\n\\n\"Tell him,\" said Tom, \"tell him, from me, and excuse the slang, if\\nyou like, but tell him there is--nothing doing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTOM IS BAFFLED\\n\\n\\nAmazement held Mr. Boylan silent for a moment, and then, staring\\nat Tom, as though he could not believe what he had heard the young\\ninventor say, the representative of Mr. Peters exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Nothing doing?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I said,\" repeated Tom, calmly.\\n\\n\"But--but you don\\'t understand, I\\'m afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, but indeed I do.\"\\n\\n\"Then you refuse to let my friend, Mr. Peters, exploit some of\\nyour inventions?\"\\n\\n\"I refuse absolutely.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come now. Take an invention that hasn\\'t been very\\nsuccessful.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t like to boast,\" said Tom with a smile, \"but all of\\nmy inventions have been successful. They don\\'t need any aid from\\nMr. Peters, thank you.\"\\n\\n\"But this one!\" went on the visitor eagerly, \"this one about some\\nnew kind of telephone,\" and he motioned to the drawings on the\\ntable. \"Has that been a success? Excuse me for having looked at\\nthe plans, but I did not think you would mind. Has that telephone\\nbeen a success? If it has not perhaps Mr. Peters could form a\\ncompany to--\"\\n\\n\"How did you know those drawings referred to a telephone?\" asked\\nTom, suspiciously, for the papers did not make it clear just what\\nthe invention was.\\n\\n\"Why, I understood--I heard, in fact, that you were working on a\\nnew photo telephone, and--\"\\n\\n\"Who told you?\" asked Tom quickly.\\n\\n\"Oh, no one in particular. The colored man who sent me here\\nmentioned--\"\\n\\n\"Eradicate!\" thought Tom. \"He must have been talking. That isn\\'t\\nlike him. I must look into this.\"\\n\\nThen to his caller he said:\\n\\n\"Really, you must excuse me, Mr. Boylan, but I don\\'t care to do\\nany business with Mr. Peters. Tell him, with my thanks, that there\\nis really nothing doing in his line. I prefer to exploit my own\\ninventions.\"\\n\\n\"That is your last word?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" returned Tom, as he gathered up the drawings.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Boylan, and Tom could not help thinking there was\\na veiled threat in his tones, \"you will regret this. You will be\\nsorry for not having accepted this offer.\"\\n\\n\"I think not,\" replied Tom, confidently. \"Good-day.\"\\n\\nThe young inventor sat for some time thinking deeply, when his\\nvisitor had gone. He called Eradicate to him, and gently\\nquestioned the old colored man, for Eradicate was ageing fast of\\nlate, and Tom did not want him to feel badly.\\n\\nIt developed that the servant had been closely cross-questioned by\\nMr. Boylan, while he was waiting for Tom, and it was small wonder\\nthat the old colored man had let slip a reference to the photo\\ntelephone. But he really knew nothing of the details of the\\ninvention, so he could have given out no secrets.\\n\\n\"But at the same time,\" mused Tom, \"I must be on guard against\\nthese fellows. That Boylan seems a pretty slick sort of a chap. As\\nfor Peters, he\\'s a big \\'bluff,\\' to be perfectly frank. I\\'m glad I\\nhad Mr. Damon\\'s warning in mind, or I might have been tempted to\\ndo business with him.\"\\n\\n\"Now to get busy at this photo telephone again. I\\'m going to try a\\ntotally different system of transmission. I\\'ll use an alternating\\ncurrent on the third wire, and see if that makes it any better.\\nAnd I\\'ll put in the most sensitive selenium plate I can make. I\\'m\\ngoing to have this thing a success.\"\\n\\nTom carefully examined the drawings of his invention, at which\\npapers Mr. Boylan had confessed to looking. As far as the young\\ninventor could tell none was missing, and as they were not\\ncompleted it would be hard work for anyone not familiar with them\\nto have gotten any of Tom\\'s ideas.\\n\\n\"But at the same time I\\'m going to be on my guard,\" mused Tom.\\n\"And now for another trial.\"\\n\\nTom Swift worked hard during the following week, and so closely\\ndid he stick to his home and workshop that he did not even pay a\\nvisit to Mr. Damon, so he did not learn in what condition that\\ngentleman\\'s affairs were. Tom even denied himself to his chum Ned,\\nso taken up was the young inventor with working out the telephone\\nproblem, until Ned fairly forced himself into the shop one day,\\nand insisted on Tom coming out.\\n\\n\"You need some fresh air!\" exclaimed Ned. \"Come on out in the\\nmotor boat again. She\\'s all fixed now; isn\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom, \"but--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, \\'but me no buts,\\' as Mr. Shakespeare would say. Come on, Tom.\\nIt will do you good. I want a spin myself.\"\\n\\n\"All right, I will go for a little while,\" agreed Tom. \"I am\\nfeeling a bit rusty, and my head seems filled with cobwebs.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t get the old thing to come out properly; eh?\"\\n\\n\"No. I guess dad was more than half right when he said it couldn\\'t\\nbe done. But I haven\\'t given up. Maybe I\\'ll think of some new plan\\nif I take a little run. Come along.\"\\n\\nThey went down to the boat house, and soon were out on the lake in\\nthe Kilo.\\n\\n\"She runs better since you had her fixed,\" remarked Ned.\\n\\n\"Yes, they did a good job.\"\\n\\n\"Did you sue Peters?\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t have to. He sent the money,\" and Tom told of his interview\\nwith Mr. Boylan. This was news to Ned, as was also the financial\\ntrouble of Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the young banker, \"that bears out what I had heard of\\nPeters--that he was a get-rich-quick chap, and a good one to steer\\nclear of.\"\\n\\n\"Speaking of steering clear,\" laughed Tom, \"there he is now, in\\nhis big boat,\" and he pointed to a red blur coming up the lake.\\n\"I\\'ll give him a wide enough berth this time.\"\\n\\nBut though Mr. Peters, in his powerful motor boat, passed close to\\nTom\\'s more modest craft, the big man did not glance toward our\\nhero and his chum. Nor did Mr. Boylan, who was with his friend,\\nlook over.\\n\\n\"I guess they\\'ve had enough of you,\" chuckled Ned.\\n\\n\"Probably he wishes he hadn\\'t paid me that money,\" said Tom. \"Very\\nlikely he thought, after he handed it over, that I\\'d be only too\\nwilling to let him manage one of my inventions. But he has another\\nguess coming.\"\\n\\nTom and Ned rode on for some distance, thoroughly enjoying the\\nspin on the lake that fine Summer day. They stopped for lunch at a\\npicnic resort, and coming back in the cool of the evening they\\nfound themselves in the midst of a little flotilla of pleasure\\ncraft, all decorated with Japanese lanterns.\\n\\n\"Better slow down a bit,\" Ned advised Tom, for many of the\\npleasure craft were canoes and light row boats. \"Our wash may\\nupset some of them.\"\\n\\n\"Guess you\\'re right, old man,\" agreed Tom, as he closed the\\ngasoline throttle, to reduce speed. Hardly had he done so than\\nthere broke in upon the merry shouts and singing of the pleasure-seekers\\nthe staccato exhaust of a powerful motor boat, coming directly\\nbehind Tom\\'s craft.\\n\\nThen came the shrill warning of an electrical siren horn.\\n\\n\"Somebody\\'s in a hurry,\" observed Tom.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Ned. \"It sounds like Peters\\'s boat, too.\"\\n\\n\"It is!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Here he comes. He ought to know better\\nthan to cut through this raft of boats at that speed.\"\\n\\n\"Is he headed toward us?\"\\n\\n\"No, I guess he\\'s had enough of that. But look at him!\"\\n\\nWith undiminished speed the burly promoter was driving his boat\\non. The big vibrating horn kept up its clamor, and a powerful\\nsearchlight in front dazzled the eyes.\\n\\n\"Look out! Look out!\" cried several.\\n\\nMany of the rowers and paddlers made haste to clear a lane for the\\nbig, speedy motor craft, and Peters and his friends (for there\\nwere several men in his boat now) seemed to accept this as a\\nmatter of course, and their right.\\n\\n\"Somebody\\'ll be swamped!\" exclaimed Ned.\\n\\nHardly had he spoken than, as the big red boat dashed past in a\\nsmother of foam, there came a startled cry in girls\\' voices.\\n\\n\"Look!\" cried Tom. \"That canoe\\'s upset! Speed her up, Ned! We\\'ve\\ngot to get \\'em!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nA GLEAM OF HOPE\\n\\n\\n\"Where are they?\"\\n\\n\"Who are they?\"\\n\\n\"Over this way! There\\'s their canoe!\"\\n\\n\"Look out for that motor boat!\"\\n\\n\"Who was it ran them down? They ought to be arrested!\"\\n\\nThese were only a few of the cries that followed the upsetting of\\nthe frail canoe by the wash from the powerful red boat. On Tom\\'s\\nKilo there was a small, electrical searchlight which he had not\\nyet switched on. But, with his call to Ned Newton to speed up the\\nmotor, that had been slowed down, Tom, with one turn of his\\nfingers, set the lamp aglow, while, with the other hand, he\\nwhirled the wheel over to head his craft for the spot where he saw\\ntwo figures struggling in the water.\\n\\nFortunately the lanterns on the various canoes and row-boats, as\\nwell as the light on the bow of Tom\\'s Kilo, made an illumination\\nthat gave the rescuers a good chance to work. Many other boats\\nbesides Tom\\'s had headed for the scene, but his was the more\\npractical, since the others--all quite small ones--were pretty\\nwell filled.\\n\\n\"There they are, Ned!\" Tom suddenly cried. \"Throw out the clutch!\\nI\\'ll get \\'em!\"\\n\\n\"Want any help?\"\\n\\n\"No, you stay at the engine, and mind what I say. Reverse now!\\nWe\\'re going to pass them!\"\\n\\nNed threw in the backing gear, and the screw churned the water to\\nfoam under the stern of the Kilo.\\n\\nTom leaned over the bow, and made a grab for the gasping,\\nstruggling figure of a girl in the water. At the same time he had\\ntossed overboard a cork life ring, attached to a rope which, in\\nturn, was made fast to the forward deck-cleat. \"Grab that!\" cried\\nTom. \"Hold on, and I\\'ll have you out in a second! That\\'s enough,\\nNed! Shut her off!\"\\n\\nThe Kilo came to a standstill, and, a second later, Tom had pulled\\ninto his boat one of the girls. She would have collapsed, and\\nfallen in a heap on the bottom boards, had not Ned, who had come\\nforward from the engine, caught her.\\n\\nThen Tom, again leaning over the side, pulled in the other girl,\\nwho was clinging to the life ring.\\n\\n\"You\\'re all right,\" Tom assured her, as she came up, gasping,\\nchoking and crying hysterically. \"You\\'re all right!\"\\n\\n\"Is--is Minnie saved?\" she sobbed.\\n\\n\"Yes, Grace! I\\'m here,\" answered the one Ned was supporting.\\n\\n\"Oh, wasn\\'t it terrible!\" cried the second girl Tom had saved.\\n\\n\"I thought we would be drowned, even though we can swim.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it--it was so--so sudden!\" gasped her companion. \"What\\nhappened?\"\\n\\n\"The wash from that big boat upset you,\" explained Tom. \"That\\nfellow ought to be ashamed of himself, rushing along the way he\\ndid. Now, can I take you girls anywhere? Your canoe seems to have\\ndrifted off.\"\\n\\n\"I have it!\" someone called. \"It\\'s turned over, but I can tow it\\nto shore.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ll take the girls home,\" offered a gentleman in a large\\nrowboat. \"My wife will look after them. They live near us,\" and he\\nmentioned his own name and the names of the two girls Tom had\\nsaved. The young inventor did not know them, but he introduced\\nhimself and Ned.\\n\\n\"This is the annual moonlight outing of our little boat club,\"\\nexplained the man who had offered to look after the girls, \"and it\\nis the first time we ever had an accident. This was not our fault,\\nthough.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed it was not,\" agreed Tom, after he had helped the two\\ndripping young ladies into the rowboat. \"It was due to Mr.\\nPeters\\'s speed mania.\"\\n\\n\"I shall make a complaint against him to the navigation\\nauthorities,\" said Mr. Ralston, who was looking after the girls.\\n\"He must think he, alone, has any rights on this lake.\"\\n\\nWith renewed thanks to Tom and Ned, the rescued girls were rowed\\noff to their homes, while the interrupted water carnival was\\ncontinued.\\n\\n\"Some little excitement; eh, Tom?\" remarked Ned, when they were\\nonce more under way.\\n\\n\"Yes. We seem to run into that fellow Peters, or some of his\\ndoings, quite often lately.\"\\n\\n\"And it isn\\'t a good sign, either,\" murmured Ned.\\n\\nFor some minutes after that Tom did not speak. In fact he was so\\nsilent that Ned at last inquired:\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Tom--in love?\"\\n\\n\"Far from it. But, Ned, I\\'ve got an idea.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'ve got a wet suit of clothes where that nice young lady\\nfainted in my arms. I\\'m soaked.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what gave me the idea--the water, I mean. I noticed how\\neverything was reflected in it, and, do you know, Ned, I believe I\\nhave been working on the wrong principle for my photo telephone.\"\\n\\n\"Wrong, Tom, how is that?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I\\'ve been using a dry plate, and I think I should have used\\na wet one. You know how even in a little puddle of water on the\\nsidewalk you can see yourself reflected?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve often seen that.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, \\'bless my watch chain!\\' as Mr. Damon would say, I\\nthink I\\'ve got just what I want. I\\'m going to try a wet plate now,\\nand I think it will work. Come on now. Speed up! I\\'m in a great\\nbig hurry to get home and try it!\"\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, I sure will be glad if you\\'ve got the right idea,\"\\nlaughed Ned. \"It will be worth getting wet through for, if you\\nstrike something. Good luck!\"\\n\\nTom could hardly wait to fasten up his boat for the night, so\\neager was he to get to his shop laboratory and try the new idea. A\\ngleam of hope had come to him.\\n\\nIt was still early evening, and Tom, when enticed out by Ned, had\\nleft his photo telephone apparatus in readiness to go on with his\\ntrials as soon as he should have come back.\\n\\n\"Now for it, Ned!\" exclaimed the young inventor, as he took off\\nhis coat. \"First I\\'ll sensitize a selenium plate, and then I\\'ll\\nwet it. Water is always a good conductor of electricity, and it\\'s\\na wonder that I forgot that when I was planning this photo\\ntelephone. But seeing the sparkle of lights, and the reflection of\\nourselves in the lake to-night, brought it back to me. Now then,\\nyou haven\\'t anything special to do; have you?\"\\n\\n\"Not a thing, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s good. Then you get in this other telephone closet--the one\\nin the casting shop. I\\'ll put a prepared plate in there, and one\\nin the booth where I\\'m to sit. Then I\\'ll switch on the current,\\nand we\\'ll see if I can make you out, and you notice whether my\\nimage appears on your plate.\"\\n\\nIt took some little time to make ready for this new test. Tom was\\nfilled with enthusiasm, and he was sure it was going to be\\nsuccessful this time. Ned watched him prepare the selenium\\nplates--plates that were so sensitive to illumination that, in the\\ndark, the metal would hardly transmit a current of electricity, but\\nin the light would do so readily, its conductivity depending on the\\namount of light it received.\\n\\n\"There, I guess we\\'re all ready, Ned,\" announced Tom, at last.\\n\"Now you go to your little coop, and I\\'ll shut myself up in mine.\\nWe can talk over the telephone.\"\\n\\nSeated in the little booth in one of the smaller of Tom\\'s shops,\\nNed proceeded with his part in the new experiment. A small shelf\\nhad been fitted up in the booth, or closet, and on this was the\\napparatus, consisting of a portable telephone set, and a small\\nbox, in which was set a selenium plate. This plate had been wet by\\na spray of water in order to test Tom\\'s new theory.\\n\\nIn a similar booth, several hundred feet away, and in another\\nbuilding, Tom took his place. The two booths were connected by\\nwires, and in each one was an electric light.\\n\\n\"All ready, Ned?\" asked Tom, through the telephone.\\n\\n\"All ready,\" came the answer.\\n\\n\"Now then, turn on your switch--the one I showed you--and look\\nright at the sensitized plate. Then turn out your light, and\\nslowly turn it on. It\\'s a new kind, and the light comes up\\ngradually, like gas or an oil lamp. Turn it on easily.\"\\n\\n\"I get you, Tom.\"\\n\\nNed did as requested. Slowly the illumination in the booth\\nincreased.\\n\\n\"Do you get anything, Tom?\" asked Ned, over the wire.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" was the somewhat discouraged answer. \"Go ahead, turn on\\nmore light, and keep your face close to the plate.\"\\n\\nNed did so.\\n\\n\"How about it now?\" he asked, a moment later.\\n\\n\"Nothing--yet,\" was the answer. And then suddenly Tom\\'s voice rose\\nto a scream over the wire.\\n\\n\"Ned--Ned! Quick!\" he called. \"Come here--I--I--\"\\n\\nThe voice died off into a meaningless gurgle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nMIDNIGHT VISITORS\\n\\n\\nNed Newton never knew exactly how he got out of the telephone\\nbooth. He seemed to give but one jump, tearing the clamped\\nreceiver from his ear, and almost upsetting the photo apparatus in\\nhis mad rush to help Tom. Certain it is, however, that he did get\\nout, and a few seconds later he was speeding toward the shop where\\nTom had taken his position in a booth.\\n\\nNed burst in, crying out:\\n\\n\"Tom! What is it? What happened? What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\nThere was no answer. Fearing the worst, Ned hurried to the small\\nbooth, in one corner of the big, dimly lighted shop. He could see\\nTom\\'s lamp burning in the telephone compartment.\\n\\n\"Tom! Tom!\" called the young banker.\\n\\nStill there was no answer, and Ned, springing forward, threw open\\nthe double, sound-proof door of the booth. Then he saw Tom lying\\nunconscious, with his head and arms on the table in front of him,\\nwhile the low buzzing of the electrical apparatus in the\\ntransmitting box told that the current had not been shut off.\\n\\n\"Tom! Tom!\" cried Ned in his chum\\'s ear. He shook him by the\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\"Are you hurt? What is the matter?\"\\n\\nThe young inventor seemed unconscious, and for a moment Ned had a\\nwild idea that Tom had been shocked to death, possibly by some\\ncrossed live wire coming in contact with the telephone circuit.\\n\\n\"But that couldn\\'t have happened, or I\\'d have been shocked\\nmyself,\" mused Ned.\\n\\nThen he became aware of a curious, sweet, sickish odor in the\\nbooth. It was overpowering. Ned felt himself growing dizzy.\\n\\n\"I have it--chloroform!\" he gasped. \"In some way Tom has been\\novercome by chloroform. I\\'ve got to get him to the fresh air.\"\\n\\nOnce he had solved the puzzle of Tom\\'s unconsciousness, Ned was\\nquick to act. He caught Tom under the arms, and dragged him out of\\nthe booth, and to the outer door of the shop. Almost before Ned\\nhad reached there with his limp burden, Tom began to revive, and\\nsoon the fresh, cool night air completed the work.\\n\\n\"I--I,\" began the young inventor. \"Ned, I--I--\"\\n\\n\"Now take it easy, Tom,\" advised his chum. \"You\\'ll be all right in\\na few minutes. What happened? Shall I call your father, or Koku?\"\\n\\n\"No--don\\'t. It would only--only alarm dad,\" faltered Tom. \"I\\'m\\ngetting all right now. But he--he nearly had me, Ned!\"\\n\\n\"He had you? What do you mean, Tom? Who had you?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who it was, but when I was talking to you over the\\nwire, all of a sudden I felt a hand behind me. It slipped over my\\nmouth and nose, and I smelled chloroform. I knew right away\\nsomething was wrong, and I called to you. That\\'s all I remember. I\\nguess I must have gone off.\"\\n\\n\"You did,\" spoke Ned. \"You were unconscious when I got to you. I\\ncouldn\\'t imagine what had happened. First I thought it was an\\nelectrical shock. Then I smelled that chloroform. But who could it\\nhave been, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Give it up, Ned! I haven\\'t the slightest idea.\"\\n\\n\"Could they have been going to rob you?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t a thing but a nickel watch on me,\" went on Tom. \"I left\\nall my cash in the house. If it was robbery, it wasn\\'t me,\\npersonally, they were after.\"\\n\\n\"What then? Some of your inventions?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my idea now, Ned. You remember some years ago Jake Burke\\nand his gang held me up and took one of dad\\'s patents away from\\nme?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'ve heard you mention that. It was when you first got your\\nmotor cycle; wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Well, what I was going to say was that they used\\nchloroform on me then, and--\"\\n\\n\"You think this is the same crowd? Why, I thought they were\\ncaptured.\"\\n\\n\"No, they got away, but I haven\\'t heard anything of them in years.\\nNow it may be they have come back for revenge, for you know we got\\nback the stolen property.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Say, Tom, it might be so. What are you going to do\\nabout it?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know. If it was Jake Burke, alias Happy Harry, and his\\ncrowd, including Appleson, Morse and Featherton, they\\'re a bad\\nlot. I wouldn\\'t want father to know they were around, for he\\'d be\\nsure to worry himself sick. He never really got over the time they\\nattacked me, and got the patent away. Dad sure thought he was\\nruined then.\"\\n\\n\"Now if I tell him I was chloroformed again to-night, and that I\\nthink it was Burke and his crowd, he\\'d be sure to get ill over it.\\nSo I\\'m just going to keep mum.\"\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps it\\'s the best plan. But you ought to do something.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I will, Ned, don\\'t worry about that. I feel much better now.\"\\n\\n\"How did it happen?\" asked Ned, his curiosity not yet satisfied.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, exactly. I was in the booth, talking to you, and\\nnot paying much attention to anything else. I was adjusting and\\nreadjusting the current, trying to get that image to appear on the\\nplate. All at once, I felt someone back of me, and, before I could\\nturn, that hand, with the chloroform sponge, was over my mouth and\\nnose. I struggled, and called out, but it wasn\\'t much use.\"\\n\\n\"But they didn\\'t do anything else--they didn\\'t take anything; did\\nthey, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Ned. We\\'ll have to look around. They must have\\nsneaked into the shop. I left the door open, you see. It would\\nhave been easy enough.\"\\n\\n\"How many were there?\"\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t tell. I only felt one fellow at me; but he may have\\nhad others with him.\"\\n\\n\"What particular invention were they after, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know. There are several models in here that\\nwould be valuable. I know one thing, though, they couldn\\'t have\\nbeen after my photo telephone,\" and Tom laughed grimly.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" Ned wanted to know.\\n\\n\"Because it\\'s a failure--that\\'s what! It\\'s a dead, sure failure,\\nNed, and I\\'m going to give it up!\" and Tom spoke bitterly.\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t say that!\" urged his chum. \"You may be right on the\\nverge of perfecting it, Tom. Didn\\'t you see any image at all on\\nthe plate?\"\\n\\n\"Not a shadow. I must be on the wrong track. Well, never mind\\nabout that now. I\\'m going to look around, and see if those fellows\\ntook anything.\"\\n\\nTom was feeling more like himself again, the effects of the\\nchloroform having passed away. He had breathed the fumes of it for\\nonly a little while, so no harm had been done. He and Ned made an\\nexamination of the shop, but found nothing missing.\\n\\nThere were no traces of the intruders, however, though the two\\nchums looked carefully about outside the building.\\n\\n\"You were too quick for them, Ned,\" said Tom. \"You came as soon as\\nI called. They heard me speaking, and must have known that I had\\ngiven the alarm.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I didn\\'t lose any time,\" admitted Ned, \"but I didn\\'t see a\\nsign of anyone as I ran up.\"\\n\\n\"They must have been pretty quick at getting away. Well, now to\\ndecide what\\'s best to do to-night.\"\\n\\nAfter some consultation and consideration it was decided to set\\nthe burglar alarms in every building of the Swift plant. Some time\\nprevious, when he had been working on a number of valuable\\ninventions, unscrupulous men had tried to steal his ideas and\\nmodels. To prevent this Tom had arranged a system of burglar\\nalarms, and had also fitted up a wizard camera that would take\\nmoving pictures of anyone coming within its focus. The camera\\ncould be set to work at night, in connection with the burglar\\nalarms.\\n\\nThe apparatus was effective, and thus an end was put to the\\nefforts of the criminals. But now it seemed Tom would have to take\\nnew precautionary measures. His camera, however, was not\\navailable, as he had loaned it to a scientific society for\\nexhibition.\\n\\n\"But we\\'ll attach the burglar wires,\" decided Tom, \"and see what\\nhappens.\"\\n\\n\"It might be a good plan to have Koku on guard,\" said Tom\\'s chum.\\n\"That giant could handle four or five of the chaps as easily as\\nyou and I could tackle one.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" agreed Tom. \"I\\'ll put him on guard. Whew! That\\nchloroform is giving me a headache. Guess I\\'ll go to bed. I wish\\nyou\\'d stay over to-night, Ned, if you haven\\'t anything else to do.\\nI may need you.\"\\n\\n\"Then of course I\\'ll stay, Tom. I\\'ll telephone home that I won\\'t\\nbe in.\"\\n\\nA little later Tom had put away his new photo telephone apparatus,\\nand had prepared for the warm reception of any unbidden callers.\\n\\n\"I wish I hadn\\'t started on this new invention,\" said Tom, half\\nbitterly, as he locked up the main parts of his machine, \"I know\\nit will never work.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes it will,\" spoke Ned, cheerfully. \"You never failed yet,\\nTom Swift, in anything you undertook, and you\\'re not going to\\nnow.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s good of you to say, Ned, but I think you\\'re wrong\\nthis time. But I\\'m not going to think any more about it to-night,\\nanyhow. Now to find Koku and put him on watch.\"\\n\\nThe giant listened carefully to Tom\\'s simple instructions.\\n\\n\"If any bad men come in the night, Koku,\" said the young inventor,\\n\"you catch them!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, master, me catch!\" said Koku, grimly. \"Me catch!\" and he\\nstretched out his powerful arms, and clenched his big hands in a\\nway that boded no good to evildoers.\\n\\nNothing was said to Mr. Swift, to Mrs. Baggert, or to Eradicate\\nabout what had happened, for Tom did not want to worry them. The\\nburglar alarms were set, Koku took his place where he could watch\\nthe signals, and at the same time be ready to rush out, for,\\nsomehow, Tom had an idea that the men who had attacked him would\\ncome back.\\n\\nTom and Ned occupied adjoining rooms, and soon were ready for bed.\\nBut, somehow, Tom could not sleep. He lay awake, tossing from side\\nto side, and, in spite of his resolution not to think about his\\nphoto telephone invention, his mind ran on nothing but that.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see what next to do to make it work,\" he told himself,\\nover and over again. \"Something is wrong--but what?\"\\n\\nAt length he fell into a fitful doze, and he had a wild dream that\\nhe was sliding down hill on a big mirror in which all sorts of\\nreflections were seen--reflections that he could not get to show\\nin the selenium plates.\\n\\nThen Tom felt the mirror bobbing up and down like a motor boat in\\na storm. He felt the vibration, and he heard a voice calling in\\nhis ear:\\n\\n\"Get up, Tom! Get up!\"\\n\\n\"Yes! What is it?\" he sleepily exclaimed,\\n\\n\"Hush!\" was the caution he heard, and then he realized that his\\ndream had been caused by Ned shaking him.\\n\\n\"Well?\" whispered Tom, in tense tones.\\n\\n\"Midnight visitors!\" answered his chum \"The burglar alarm has just\\ngone off! The airship hangar drop fell. Koku has gone out. Come\\non!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\nTHE AIRSHIP IS TAKEN\\n\\n\\nTom leaped silently out of bed, and stood for a moment half\\ndazed, so soundly had he been sleeping.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" urged Ned softly, realizing that his chum had not fully\\ncomprehended. \"Koku will hold them until we get there. I haven\\'t\\nroused anyone else.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" whispered Tom, as he began putting on his clothes.\\n\"I don\\'t want father to know. When did it happen?\"\\n\\n\"Just a little while ago. I couldn\\'t sleep very well, but I fell\\ninto a doze, and then I heard the buzzer of the alarm go off. I\\nsaw that the drop, showing that the hangar had been entered, had\\nfallen. I got to the window in time to see Koku going toward the\\nshed from his little coop. Then I came to you.\"\\n\\n\"Glad you did,\" answered Tom. \"I didn\\'t think I was sleeping so\\nsoundly.\"\\n\\nTogether the two chums made their way from their rooms down the\\ndimly-lighted hall to a side door, whence they could reach the\\nairship hangar, or shed.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t we need something--a gun or--\" began Ned.\\n\\n\"Clubs are better--especially at night when you can\\'t see to aim\\nvery well,\" whispered back Tom. \"I\\'ve got a couple of good ones\\ndownstairs. I could use my electric rifle, and set it merely to\\ndisable temporarily whoever the charge hit, but it\\'s a little too\\nrisky. Koku has a habit of getting in the way at the most\\nunexpected times. He\\'s so big, you know. I think clubs will be\\nbest.\"\\n\\n\"All right, Tom, just as you say,\" agreed Ned. \"But who do you\\nthink it can be?\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea. Probably the same fellows who were\\nafter me before, though. This time I\\'ll find out what their game\\nis, and what they\\'re after.\"\\n\\nThe chums reached the lower hall, and there Tom picked out two\\nAfrican war clubs which he had brought back with him from one of\\nhis many trips into wild lands.\\n\\n\"These are just the thing!\" exclaimed Ned, swinging his about.\\n\\n\"Careful,\" cautioned Tom, \"If you hit something you\\'ll rouse the\\nhouse, and I don\\'t want my father and Mrs. Baggert, to say nothing\\nof Eradicate, awakened.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" murmured Ned. \"But we\\'d better be getting a move on.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" agreed Tom. He dropped into a side pocket a small\\nbut powerful electric flash lamp, and then he and Ned let\\nthemselves out.\\n\\nThere had been a bright moon, but it was now overcast by clouds.\\nHowever, there was sufficient light to enable the two lads to see\\nobjects quite clearly. All about them were the various buildings\\nthat made up the manufacturing and experimental plant of Tom Swift\\nand his father. Farthest away from the house was the big shed\\nwhere once Tom had kept a balloon, but which was now given over to\\nhis several airships. In front of it was a big, level grassy\\nspace, needed to enable the aircraft to get a \"running start\"\\nbefore they could mount into the clouds.\\n\\n\"See anything of Koku?\" whispered Ned.\\n\\n\"No,\" answered Tom, in the same cautious voice. \"I guess he must\\nbe hiding--\"\\n\\n\"There he goes now!\" hissed Ned, pointing to a big figure that was\\napproaching the hangar. It was undoubtedly that of the giant, and\\nhe could be seen, in the dim light, stalking cautiously along.\\n\\n\"I wonder where the uninvited guests are?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Probably in the airship shed,\" answered Ned. \"Koku was after them\\nas soon as the alarm went off, and they couldn\\'t have gotten away.\\nThey must be inside there yet. But what can their game be?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard to say,\" admitted Tom. \"They may be trying to get\\nsomething belonging to me, or they may imagine they can pick up\\nsome valuable secrets. Or they may--\" He stopped suddenly, and\\nthen exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Come on, Ned! They\\'re after one of the airships! That\\'s it! My\\nbig biplane is all ready to start, and they can get it in motion\\ninside of a few seconds. Oh, why didn\\'t I hurry?\" he added,\\nbitterly.\\n\\nBut the hangar was still some distance away, and it would take two\\nor three minutes of running to reach it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, and at the instant Tom had his thought of the possible\\ntheft of his biggest aircraft, something happened.\\n\\nThe doors of the shed were suddenly thrown open, and the two boys\\ncould see the large airship being wheeled out. The hazy light of\\nthe moon behind the clouds shone on the expanse of white planes,\\nand on the fish-tail rudder, one of Tom\\'s latest ideas.\\n\\n\"Hey, there!\" cried Tom, warningly.\\n\\n\"Leave that alone!\" yelled Ned.\\n\\n\"Koku! Koku!\" shouted Tom, shrilly. \"Get after those fellows!\"\\n\\n\"Me get!\" boomed out the giant, in his deep voice.\\n\\nHe had been standing near the entrance to the hangar, probably\\nwaiting for developments, and watching for the arrival of Tom and\\nNed. The big form was seen to leap forward, and then several dark\\nshadows swarmed from around the airship, and were seen to fling\\nthemselves upon the giant.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a fight!\" cried Ned. \"They\\'re attacking him!\"\\n\\n\"Koku can take care of himself!\" murmured Tom. \"But come on. I\\ndon\\'t see what their game is.\"\\n\\nHe understood a moment later, however, for while several of the\\nmidnight visitors were engaged in a hand-to-hand tussle with the\\ngiant there came a sharp, throbbing roar of the airship motor in\\nmotion. The propellers were being whirled rapidly about.\\n\\n\"Koku! Koku!\" cried Tom, for he was still some distance off.\\n\"Never mind them! Don\\'t let the airship be taken!\"\\n\\nBut Koku could only grunt. Big and strong as he was, half a dozen\\nmen attacking him at once hampered him. He threw them from him,\\none after another, and was gradually making his way toward the now\\nslowly-moving airship. But would he be in time?\\n\\nTom and Ned could not hope to reach the machine before Koku,\\nthough they were running at top speed.\\n\\n\"Koku! Koku!\" yelled Tom. \"Don\\'t let them get away!\"\\n\\nBut Koku could only grunt--harder this time--for he fell heavily,\\nbeing tripped by a stick thrust between his legs. He lay for a\\nmoment stunned.\\n\\n\"They\\'re going to get away!\" panted Tom, making an effort to\\nincrease his speed.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what!\" agreed Ned.\\n\\nEven as they spoke the roar of the airship motor increased.\\nSeveral of the dark forms which had been engaged in the struggle\\nwith Koku were seen to pick themselves up, and run toward the\\nairship, that was now in motion, moving on the bicycle wheels over\\nthe grass plot, preparatory to mounting upward in the sky.\\n\\n\"Stop! Stop!\" commanded Tom. But it was all in vain.\\n\\nThe men leaped aboard the airship, which could carry six persons,\\nand a moment later, with a deafening roar, as the engine opened up\\nfull, the big craft shot upward, taking away all but two of the\\nmidnight visitors. These, who had seemingly been stunned by Koku,\\nnow arose from the ground, and staggered off in the darkness.\\n\\n\"Get them!\" cried Tom.\\n\\n\"We must see to Koku!\" added Ned, \"Look, there goes your airship,\\nTom!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know. But we can\\'t stop that now. Let\\'s see if we can get\\na clue in these fellows!\"\\n\\nHe pointed toward the two who had run off in the dark underbrush\\nsurrounding the hangar plaza, and he and Ned trailed them as well\\nas they could. But from the first they knew it would be useless,\\nfor there were many hiding places, and, a little way beyond, was a\\nclump of trees.\\n\\nAfter a short search Tom gave up reluctantly, and came back to\\nwhere Koku was now sitting on the ground.\\n\\n\"Are you hurt?\" he asked of the giant.\\n\\n\"My mind hurt--that all,\" said the big man.\\n\\n\"I guess he means his feelings are hurt,\" Tom explained. \"Do you\\nknow who they were, Koku?\"\\n\\n\"No, master.\"\\n\\n\"But we must do something!\" cried Ned. \"They\\'ve got your airship,\\nTom.\"\\n\\n\"I know it,\" said the young inventor, calmly. \"But we can\\'t do\\nanything now. You can hardly hear her, let alone see her. She\\'s\\nmoving fast!\"\\n\\nHe pointed upward to the darkness. Like some black bird of prey\\nthe airship was already lost to sight, though it would have seemed\\nas if her white planes might render her visible. But she had moved\\nso swiftly that, during the short search, she had already\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you going to do anything?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" spoke Tom. \"I\\'m going to telephone an alarm to all\\nthe nearby towns. This is certainly a queer game, Ned.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nA STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE\\n\\n\\nDisappointed and puzzled, Tom and Ned went to where Koku was\\nstanding in rather a dazed attitude. The giant, like all large\\nbodies, moved slowly, not only bodily but mentally. He could\\nunderstand exactly what had happened, except that he had not\\nprevailed over the \"pygmies\" who had attacked him. They had been\\ntoo many for him.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s take a look inside,\" suggested Tom, when, by another glance\\nupward, he had made sure that all trace of his big airship was\\ngone. \"Maybe we can get a clue. Then, Koku, you tell us what\\nhappened.\"\\n\\n\"It all happened to me,\" said the giant, simply. \"Me no make\\nanything happen to them.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s about right,\" laughed Tom, ruefully. \"It all happened to\\nus.\"\\n\\nThe lights in the hangar were switched on, but a careful search\\nrevealed little. The men, half a dozen or more, had come evidently\\nwell prepared for the taking away of Tom Swift\\'s airship, and they\\nhad done so.\\n\\nEntrance had been effected by forcing a small side door. True, the\\nburglar alarm had given notice of the presence of the men, but Tom\\nand Ned had not acted quite quickly enough. Koku had been at the\\nhangar almost as soon as the men themselves, but he had watched\\nand waited for orders, instead of going in at once, and this had\\ngiven the intruders time to wheel out the craft and start the\\nmotor.\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you jump right in on them when you saw what they were\\nup to, Koku?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Me wait for master. Me think master want to see who men were. Me\\ngo in--they run.\"\\n\\n\"Well, of course that\\'s so, in a way,\" admitted Tom. \"They\\nprobably would have run, but they\\'d have run WITHOUT my airship\\ninstead of WITH it, if they hadn\\'t had time to get it outside the\\nhangar. However, there\\'s no use in crying over lost biplanes. The\\nnext thing is how to get her back. Did you know any of the men,\\nKoku?\"\\n\\n\"No, master.\"\\n\\n\"Then we haven\\'t any clue that way. They laid their plans well.\\nThey just let you tangle yourself up with them, Koku, while the\\nhead ones got the motor going; an easy matter, since it was all\\nready to start. Then they tripped you, Koku, and as many of them\\nas could, made a jump for the machine. Then they were off.\"\\n\\n\"Well, what\\'s the next thing to do?\" asked Ned, when another look\\nabout the shed had shown that not the slightest clue was\\navailable.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to do some telephoning,\" Tom stated. \"A big airship\\nlike mine can\\'t go scooting around the country without being\\nnoticed. And those fellows can\\'t go on forever. They\\'ve got to\\nhave gasoline and oil, and to get them they\\'ll have to come down.\\nI\\'ll get it back, sooner or later; but the question is: Why did\\nthey take her?\"\\n\\n\"To sell,\" suggested Ned.\\n\\n\"I think not,\" Tom said. \"A big airship like mine isn\\'t easy to\\nsell. People who would buy it would ask questions that might not\\neasily be answered. I\\'m inclined to think that some other reason\\nmade them take her, and it\\'s up to us to find out what it was.\\nLet\\'s go into the house.\"\\n\\n\"Hark!\" suddenly exclaimed Ned, holding up his hand for silence.\\nThey all heard footsteps outside the hangar.\\n\\nTom sprang to the door, flashing his electric light, and a voice\\nexclaimed:\\n\\n\"Golly! Chicken thieves!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, is it you, Eradicate?\" asked the young inventor, with a\\nlaugh. \"No, it isn\\'t chicken thieves--they were after bigger game\\nthis time.\"\\n\\n\"Suffin happen?\" asked the colored man. \"Massa Swift he heah a\\nnoise, an\\' see a light, an\\' he sent me out yeah t\\' see what all am\\ngwine on.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, something happened,\" admitted Tom. \"They got the Eagle,\\nRad.\"\\n\\n\"What! Yo\\' big airship?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Huh! Dat\\'s too bad, Massa Tom. I suah am sorry t\\' heah dat. Who\\ndone it?\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t know, Rad.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe it was dat low-down cousin ob mine what tried t\\' git mah\\nchickens, onct!\"\\n\\n\"No, Rad, it wasn\\'t your cousin. But I\\'ll telephone the alarm to\\nthe police. They may be able to help me get the Eagle back.\"\\n\\nWithin the next hour several messages were sent to the authorities\\nof nearby towns, asking them to be on the watch for the stolen\\nairship. This was about all that could be done, and after Mr.\\nSwift had been told the story of the night\\'s happenings, everyone\\nwent back to bed again.\\n\\nFurther search the next morning brought forth no clues, though\\nTom, Ned and the others beat about in the bushes where the men had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nOne or two reports were heard from surrounding towns, to the\\neffect that several persons had heard a strange throbbing sound in\\nthe night, that, possibly, was caused by the passage of the\\nairship overhead. One such report came from Waterford, the home\\ntown of Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s go over there,\" suggested Ned, to his chum. \"I\\'d like to\\nsee our friend, and maybe we can get some other clues by\\ncirculating around there.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" spoke Tom, rather listlessly.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" Ned wanted to know.\\n\\n\"Well, I ought to be working on my photo telephone,\" was the\\nanswer. \"I\\'ve got a new idea now. I\\'m going to try a different\\nkind of current, and use a more sensitive plate. And I\\'ll use a\\ntungsten filament lamp in the sending booth.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, let your experiments go for a little while, Tom,\" suggested\\nNed. \"Come on over to Mr. Damon\\'s. The trouble with you is that\\nyou keep too long at a thing, once you start.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the only way to succeed,\" remarked Tom. \"Really, Ned,\\nwhile I feel sorry about the airship, of course, I ought to be\\nworking on my telephone. I\\'ll get the Eagle back sooner or later.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the way to talk, Tom. Let\\'s follow up this clue.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you insist on it I suppose I may as well go. We\\'ll take\\nthe little monoplane. I\\'ve fixed her up to carry double. I guess--\"\\n\\nTom Swift broke off suddenly, as the telephone at his elbow rang.\\n\\n\"Hello,\" he said, taking off the receiver. \"Yes, this is Tom\\nSwift. Oh, good morning, Mrs. Damon! Eh! What\\'s that? Mr. Damon\\nhas disappeared? You don\\'t tell me! Disappeared! Yes, yes, I can\\ncome right over. Be there in a few minutes. Eh? You don\\'t know\\nwhat to make of it? Oh, well, maybe it can easily be explained.\\nYes, Ned Newton and I will be right over. Don\\'t worry.\"\\n\\nTom hung up the receiver and turned to his chum.\\n\\n\"What do you think of that?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Damon mysteriously vanished last night, and this morning\\nword came from his bankers that every cent of his fortune had\\ndisappeared! He\\'s lost everything!\"\\n\\n\"Maybe--maybe--\" hesitated Ned.\\n\\n\"No, Mr. Damon isn\\'t that kind of a man,\" said Tom, stoutly. \"He\\nhasn\\'t made away with himself.\"\\n\\n\"But something is wrong!\"\\n\\n\"Evidently, and it\\'s up to us to find out what it is. I shouldn\\'t\\nbe surprised but that he knew of this coming trouble and started\\nout to prevent it if he could.\"\\n\\n\"But he wouldn\\'t disappear and make his wife worry.\"\\n\\n\"No, that\\'s so. Well, we\\'ll have to go over there and find out all\\nabout it.\"\\n\\n\"Say, Tom!\" exclaimed Ned, as they were getting the small, but\\nswift monoplane ready for the flight, \"could there be any\\nconnection with the disappearance of Mr. Damon and the taking of\\nthe Eagle?\"\\n\\nTom started in surprise.\\n\\n\"How could there be?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" answered Ned. \"It was only an idea.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll see what Mrs. Damon has to say,\" spoke the young\\ninventor, as he took his seat beside Ned, and motioned to Koku to\\ntwirl the propeller.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nTHE TELEPHONE PICTURE\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Tom Swift! I\\'m so glad to see you!\"\\n\\nMrs. Damon clasped her arms, in motherly fashion, about the young\\ninventor. He held her close, and his own eyes were not free from\\ntears as he witnessed the grief of his best friend\\'s wife.\\n\\n\"Now, don\\'t worry, Mrs. Damon,\" said Tom, sympathetically.\\n\"Everything will be all right,\" and he led her to a chair.\\n\\n\"All right, Tom! How can it be?\" and the lady raised a tear-stained\\nface. \"My husband has disappeared, without a word! It\\'s just as\\nif the earth had opened and swallowed him up! I can\\'t find a trace\\nof him! How can it be all right?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll find him, Mrs. Damon. Don\\'t worry. Ned and I will get\\nright to work, and I\\'ll have all the police and detectives within\\nfifty miles on the search--if we have to go that far.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s awfully good of you, Tom. I--I didn\\'t know who else to\\nturn to in my trouble but you.\"\\n\\n\"And why shouldn\\'t you come to me? I\\'d do anything for you and Mr.\\nDamon. Now tell me all about it.\"\\n\\nTom and Ned had just arrived at the Damon home in the airship, to\\nfind the wife of the eccentric man almost distracted over her\\nhusband\\'s strange disappearance.\\n\\n\"It happened last night,\" Mrs. Damon said, when she was somewhat\\ncomposed. \"Last night about twelve o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\"Twelve o\\'clock!\" cried Tom, in surprise \"Why that\\'s about the\\ntime--\"\\n\\nHe stopped suddenly.\\n\\n\"What were you going to say?\" asked Mrs. Damon.\\n\\n\"Oh--nothing,\" answered Tom. \"I--I\\'ll tell you later. Go on,\\nplease.\"\\n\\n\"It is all so confusing,\" proceeded Mrs. Damon. \"You know my\\nhusband has been in trouble of late--financial trouble?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" responded Tom, \"he mentioned it to me.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know any of the details,\" sighed Mrs. Damon, \"but I know\\nhe was mixed up with a man named Peters.\"\\n\\n\"I know him, too,\" spoke Tom, grimly.\\n\\n\"My husband has been very gloomy of late,\" went on Mrs. Damon. \"He\\nfoolishly entrusted almost his entire fortune to that man, and\\nlast night he told me it was probably all gone. He said he saw\\nonly the barest chance to save it, but that he was going to take\\nthat chance.\"\\n\\n\"Did he go into details?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"No, that was all he said. That was about ten o\\'clock. He didn\\'t\\nwant to go to bed. He just sat about, and he kept saying over and\\nover again: \\'Bless my tombstone!\\' \\'Bless the cemetery!\\' and all\\nsuch stuff as that. You know how he was,\" and she smiled through\\nher tears.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Tom. \"I know. Only it wasn\\'t like him to bless such\\ngrewsome things. He was more jolly.\"\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t been, of late,\" sighed his wife. \"Well, he sat about\\nall the evening, and he kept figuring away, trying, I suppose, to\\nfind some way out of his trouble.\"\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t he come to my father?\" cried Tom. \"I told him he could\\nhave all the money he needed to tide him over.\"\\n\\n\"Well, Mr. Damon was queer that way,\" said his wife. \"He wanted to\\nbe independent. I urged him to call you up, but he said he\\'d fight\\nit out alone.\"\\n\\n\"As I said, we sat there, and he kept feeling more and more blue,\\nand blessing his funeral, and the hearse and all such things as\\nthat. He kept looking at the clock, too, and I wondered at that.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Are you expecting someone?\\' I asked him. He said he wasn\\'t,\\nexactly, but I made sure he was, and finally, about half-past\\neleven, he put on his hat and went out.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Where are you going?\\' I asked him.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Oh, just to get a breath of air. I can\\'t sleep,\\' he said. I\\ndidn\\'t think much of that, as he often used to go out and walk\\nabout a bit before going to bed. So he went out, and I began to\\nsee about locking up, for I never trust the servants.\"\\n\\n\"It must have been about an hour later when I heard voices out in\\nfront. I looked, and I saw Mr. Damon talking to a man.\"\\n\\n\"Who was he?\" asked Tom, eagerly, on the alert for the slightest\\nclue.\\n\\n\"I thought at the time,\" said Mrs. Damon, \"that it was one of the\\nneighbors. I have learned since, however, that it was not. Anyhow,\\nthis man and Mr. Damon stood talking for a little while, and then\\nthey went off together. I didn\\'t think it strange at the time,\\nsupposing he was merely strolling up and down in front with Mr.\\nBlackson, who lives next door, He often had done that before.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I saw that the house was locked up, and then I sat down in\\na chair to wait for Mr. Damon to come back. I was getting sleepy,\\nfor we don\\'t usually stay up so late. I suppose I must have dozed\\noff, but I was suddenly awakened by hearing a peculiar noise. I\\nsat up in alarm, and then I realized that Mr. Damon had not come\\nin.\"\\n\\n\"I was frightened then, and I called my maid. It was nearly one\\no\\'clock, and my husband never stays out as late as that. We went\\nnext door, and found that Mr. Blackson had not been out of his\\nhouse that evening. So it could not have been he to whom Mr. Damon\\nwas speaking.\"\\n\\n\"We roused up other neighbors, and they searched all about the\\ngrounds, thinking he might have been overcome by a sudden faint.\\nBut we could not find him. My husband had disappeared--mysteriously\\ndisappeared!\" and the lady broke into sobs.\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t worry,\" said Tom, soothingly, as he put his arms about\\nher as he would have done to his own mother, had she been alive,\\n\"We\\'ll get him back!\"\\n\\n\"But how can you? No one knows where he is.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said Tom, confidently, \"Mr. Damon himself knows where\\nhe is, and unless he has gone away voluntarily, I think you will\\nsoon hear from him.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean by--voluntarily?\" asked the wife.\\n\\n\"First let me ask you a question,\" came from Tom. \"You said you\\nwere awakened by a peculiar noise. What sort of a sound was it?\"\\n\\n\"Why, a whirring, throbbing noise, like--like--\"\\n\\nShe paused for a comparison.\\n\\n\"Like an airship?\" asked Tom, with a good deal of eagerness.\\n\\n\"That was it!\" cried Mrs. Damon. \"I was trying to think where I\\nhad heard the sound before. It was just like the noise your\\nairship makes, Tom!\"\\n\\n\"That settles it!\" exclaimed the young inventor.\\n\\n\"Settles what?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"The manner of Mr. Damon\\'s disappearance. He was taken away--or\\nwent away--in my airship--the airship that was stolen from my shed\\nlast night!\"\\n\\nMrs. Damon stared at Tom in amazement.\\n\\n\"Why--why--how could that be?\" she asked.\\n\\nQuickly Tom told of what had happened at his place.\\n\\n\"I begin to see through it,\" he said. \"There is some plot here,\\nand we\\'ve got to get to the bottom of it. Mr. Damon either went\\nwith these men in the airship willingly, or he was taken away by\\nforce. I\\'m inclined to think he went of his own accord, or you\\nwould have heard some outcry, Mrs. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps so,\" she admitted. \"But would he go away in that\\nmanner without telling me?\"\\n\\n\"He might,\" said Tom, willing to test his theory on all sides. \"He\\nmight not have wanted you to worry, for you know you dislike him\\nto go up an airships.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do. Oh, if I only thought he did go away of his own\\naccord, I could understand it. He went, if he did, to try and save\\nhis fortune.\"\\n\\n\"It does look as though he had an appointment with someone, Tom,\"\\nsuggested Ned. \"His looking at the clock, and then going out, and all\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" admitted the young inventor, \"and now I\\'m inclined to\\nchange my theory a bit. It may have been some other airship than\\nmine that was used.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"Because the men who took mine were unprincipled fellows. Mr.\\nDamon would not have gone away with men who would steal an\\nairship.\"\\n\\n\"Not if he knew it,\" admitted Ned. \"Well, then, let\\'s consider two\\nairships--yours and the other that came to keep the appointment\\nwith Mr. Damon. If the last is true, why should he want to go away\\nin an airship at midnight? Why couldn\\'t he take a train, or an\\nauto?\"\\n\\n\"Well, we don\\'t know all the ins and outs,\" admitted Tom. \"Taking\\na midnight airship ride is rather strange, but that may have been\\nthe only course open. We\\'ll have to let the explanation go until\\nlater. At any rate, Mrs. Damon, I feel sure that your husband did\\ngo off through the air--either in my Eagle or in some other\\ncraft.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad to hear you say so, Tom Swift, though it sounds a\\ndreadful thing to say. But if he did go off of his own accord, I\\nknow he did it for the best. And he may not have told me, for fear\\nI would worry. I can understand that. But why isn\\'t he back now?\"\\n\\nTom had been rather dreading that question. It was one he had\\nasked himself, and he had found no good answer for it. If there\\nhad been such need of haste, that an airship had to be used, why\\nhad not Mr. Damon come back ere this? Unless, as Tom feared to\\nadmit, even to himself, there had been some accident.\\n\\nHalf a dozen theories flashed through his mind, but he could not\\nselect a good, working one,--particularly as there were no clues.\\nDisappearing in an airship was the one best means of not leaving a\\ntrace behind. An auto, a motor boat, a train, a horse and\\ncarriage--all these could be more or less easily traced. But an\\nairship--\\n\\nIf Mr. Damon wanted to cover up his tracks, or if he had been\\ntaken away, and his captors wanted to baffle pursuit, the best\\nmeans had been adopted.\\n\\n\"Now don\\'t you worry,\" advised Tom to Mrs. Damon. \"I know it looks\\nfunny, but I think it will come out all right. Ned and I will do\\nall we can. Mr. Damon must have known what he was about. But, to\\nbe on the safe side, we\\'ll send out a general alarm through the\\npolice.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know what I\\'d done if you hadn\\'t come to help me!\"\\nexclaimed Mrs. Damon.\\n\\n\"Just you leave it to me!\" said the young inventor, cheerfully.\\n\"I\\'ll find Mr. Damon!\"\\n\\nBut, though he spoke thus confidently, Tom Swift had not the\\nslightest notion, just then, of how to set about his difficult\\ntask. He had had hard problems to solve before, so he was not\\ngoing to give up this one. First he wanted to think matters out,\\nand arrange a plan of action.\\n\\nHe and Ned made a careful examination of the grounds of the Damon\\nhomestead. There was little they could learn, though they did find\\nwhere an airship had landed in a meadow, not far away, and where\\nit had made a flying start off again.\\n\\nCarefully Tom looked at the marks made by the wheels of the\\nairship.\\n\\n\"They\\'re the same distance apart as those on the Eagle,\" he said\\nto his chum, \"and the tires are the same. But that isn\\'t saying\\nanything, as lots of airships have the same equipment. So we won\\'t\\njump to any conclusions that way.\"\\n\\nTom and Ned interviewed several of the neighbors, but beyond\\nlearning that some of them had heard the throbbing of the midnight\\nairship, that was as far as they got on that line.\\n\\nThere was nothing more they could do in Waterford, and, leaving\\nMrs. Damon, who had summoned a relative to stay with her, the two\\nchums made a quick trip back through the air to Shopton. As\\nEradicate came out to help put away the monoplane Tom noticed that\\nthe colored man was holding one hand as though it hurt him.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Rad?\" asked the young investor.\\n\\n\"Oh, nuffin--jest natcherly nuffin, Massa Tom.\"\\n\\nBut Eradicate spoke evasively and in a manner that roused Tom\\'s\\nsuspicions.\\n\\n\"Boomerang, your mule, didn\\'t kick you; did he?\"\\n\\n\"No, sah, Massa Tom, no sah. \\'Twern\\'t nuffin laik dat.\"\\n\\n\"But what was it? Your hand is hurt!\"\\n\\n\"Well, Massa Tom, I s\\'pose I done bettah tell yo\\' all. I\\'se had a\\nshock!\"\\n\\n\"A shock?\"\\n\\n\"Yas, sah. A shock. A lickrish shock.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you mean an electrical shock. That\\'s too bad. I suppose you\\nmust have touched a live wire.\"\\n\\n\"No, sah. \\'Twern\\'t dat way.\"\\n\\n\"How was it, then?\"\\n\\n\"Well, yo\\' see, Massa Tom, I were playin\\' a joke on Koku.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, you were; eh? Then I suppose Koku shocked you,\" laughed Tom.\\n\\n\"No, sah. I--I\\'ll tell you. Dat giant man he were in de telefoam\\nboof in de pattern shop--you know--de one where yo\\' all been\\ntryin\\' to make pishures.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know. Go on!\" exclaimed Tom, impatiently.\\n\\n\"Well, he were in dere, Massa Tom, an\\' I slipped into de boof in\\nde next shop--de odder place where yo\\' all been \\'speermentin\\'. I\\ncalled out on de telefoam, loud laik de Angel Gabriel gwine t\\'\\nholler at de last trump: \\'Look out, yo\\' ole sinnah!\\' I yell it\\njest t\\' scare Koku.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Tom, a bit severely, for he did not like Eradicate\\ninterfering with the instruments. \"And did you scare Koku?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yas, sah, Massa Tom. I skeered him all right; but suffin else\\ndone happen. When I put down de telefoam I got a terrible shock.\\nIt hurts yit!\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom, \"I suppose I ought to feel sorry for you,\\nbut I can\\'t. You should let things alone. Now I\\'ve got to see if\\nyou did any damage. Come along, Ned.\"\\n\\nTom was the first to enter the telephone booth where Eradicate had\\nplayed the part of the Angel Gabriel. He looked at the wires and\\napparatus, but could see nothing wrong.\\n\\nThen he glanced at the selenium plate, on which he hoped, some\\nday, to imprint an image from over the wire. And, as he saw the\\nsmooth surface he started, and cried.\\n\\n\"Ned! Ned, come here quick!\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked his chum, crowding into the booth.\\n\\n\"Look at that plate! Tell me what you see!\"\\n\\nNed looked.\\n\\n\"Why--why it\\'s Koku\\'s picture!\" he gasped.\\n\\n\"Exactly!\" cried Tom. \"In some way my experiment has succeeded\\nwhen I was away. Eradicate must have made some new connection by\\nhis monkeying. Ned, it\\'s a success! I\\'ve got my first photo\\ntelephone picture! Hurray!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nMAKING IMPROVEMENTS\\n\\n\\nTom Swift was so overjoyed and excited that for a few moments he\\ncapered about, inside the booth, and outside, knocking against his\\nchum Ned, clapping him on the back, and doing all manner of boyish\\n\"stunts.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a success, Ned! I\\'ve struck it!\" cried Tom, in delight.\\n\\n\"Ouch! You struck ME, you mean!\" replied Ned, rubbing his\\nshoulder, where the young inventor had imparted a resounding blow\\nof joy.\\n\\n\"What of it?\" exclaimed Tom. \"My apparatus works! I can send a\\npicture by telephone! It\\'s great, Ned!\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t exactly understand how it happened,\" said Ned, in\\nsome bewilderment, as he gazed at the selenium plate.\\n\\n\"Neither do I,\" admitted Tom, when he had somewhat calmed down.\\n\"That is, I don\\'t exactly understand what made the thing succeed\\nnow, when it wouldn\\'t work for me a little while ago. But I\\'ve got\\nto go into that. I\\'ll have to interview that rascal Eradicate, and\\nlearn what he did when he played that trick on Koku. Yes, and I\\'ll\\nhave to see Koku, too. We\\'ve got to get at the bottom of this,\\nNed.\"\\n\\n\"I suppose so. You\\'ve got your hands full, Tom, with your photo\\ntelephone, and the disappearance of Mr. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and my own airship, too. I must get after that. Whew! A lot\\nof things to do! But I like work, Ned. The more the better.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s like you, Tom. But what are you going to get at\\nfirst?\"\\n\\n\"Let me see; the telephone, I think. I\\'ll have Rad and Koku in\\nhere and talk to them. I say, you Eradicate!\" he called out of the\\ndoor of the shop, as he saw the colored man going past, holding\\nhis shocked arm tenderly.\\n\\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom, I\\'se comin\\'! What is it yo\\' all wants, Massa\\nTom?\"\\n\\n\"I want you to show me exactly what you did to the wires, and\\nother things in here, when you played that Angel Gabriel trick on\\nyour partner Koku.\"\\n\\n\"Partner! He ain\\'t mah partner!\" exclaimed Eradicate with a scowl,\\nfor there was not the best of feeling between the two. Eradicate\\nhad served in the Swift family many years, and he rather resented\\nthe coming of the giant, who performed many services formerly the\\nprovince of the colored man.\\n\\n\"Well, never mind what he is, Rad,\" laughed Tom. \"You just show me\\nwhat you did. Come now, something happened in here, and I want to\\nfind out what it was.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, suffin done happened all right, Massa Tom. Yas, sah! Suffin\\ndone happened!\" cried Eradicate, with such odd emphasis that Tom\\nand Ned both laughed.\\n\\n\"An\\' suffin happened to me,\" went on the colored man, rubbing his\\nshocked arm.\\n\\n\"Well, tell us about it,\" suggested Tom.\\n\\n\"It was dish yeah way,\" proceeded Eradicate. And he told more in\\ndetail how, seeing Koku cleaning and sweeping out the other\\ntelephone booth, he had thought of the trick to play on him. Both\\ntelephones had what are called \"amplifiers\" attached, that could\\nbe switched on when needed. These amplifiers were somewhat like\\nthe horn of a phonograph--they increased, or magnified the sound,\\nso that one could hear a voice from any part of the shop, and need\\nnot necessarily have the telephone receiver at his ear.\\n\\nSeeing Koku near the instrument, Eradicate had switched on the\\namplifier, and had called into his instrument, trying to scare the\\ngiant. And he did startle Koku, for the loud voice, coming so\\nsuddenly, sent the giant out of the booth on the run.\\n\\n\"But you must have done something else,\" insisted Tom. \"Look here,\\nRad,\" and the young inventor pointed to the picture on the plate.\\n\\n\"Mah gracious sakes!\" gasped the colored man. \"Why dat\\'s Koku\\nhisse\\'f!\" and he looked in awe at the likeness.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what you did, Rad!\"\\n\\n\"Me? I done dat? No, sah, Massa Tom. I neber did! No, sah!\"\\nEradicate spoke emphatically.\\n\\n\"Yes you did, Rad. You took that picture of Koku over my photo\\ntelephone, and I want you to show me exactly what you did--what\\nwires and switches you touched and changed, and all that.\"\\n\\n\"Yo--yo\\' done say I tuck dat pishure, Massa Tom?\"\\n\\n\"You sure did, Rad.\"\\n\\n\"Well--well, good land o\\' massy! An\\' I done dat!\"\\n\\nEradicate stared in wonder at the image of the giant on the plate,\\nand shook his head doubtingly.\\n\\n\"I--I didn\\'t know I could do it. I never knowed I had it in me!\"\\nhe murmured.\\n\\nTom and Ned laughed long and loud, and then the young inventor\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Now look here, Rad. You\\'ve done me a mighty big service, though\\nyou didn\\'t know it, and I want to thank you. I\\'m sorry about your\\narm, and I\\'ll have the doctor look at it. But now I want you to\\nshow me all the things you touched when you played that joke on\\nKoku. In some way you did what I haven\\'t been able to do, You took\\nthe picture. There\\'s probably just one little thing I\\'ve\\noverlooked, and you stumbled on it by accident. Now go ahead and\\nshow me.\"\\n\\nEradicate thought for a moment, and then said:\\n\\n\"Well, I done turned on de current, laik I seen you done, Massa\\nTom.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, go on. You connected the telephone.\"\\n\\n\"Yas, sah. Den I switched on that flyer thing yo\\' all has rigged\\nup.\"\\n\\n\"You switched on the amplifier, yes. Go on.\"\\n\\n\"An\\'--an\\' den I plugged in dish year wire,\" and the colored man\\npointed to one near the top of the booth.\\n\\n\"You switched on that wire, Rad! Why, great Scott, man! That\\'s\\nconnected to the arc light circuit--it carries over a thousand\\nvolts. And you switched that into the telephone circuit?\"\\n\\n\"Dat\\'s what I done did, Massa Tom; yas, sah!\"\\n\\n\"What for?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I done want t\\' make mah voice good an\\' loud t\\' skeer dat\\nrascal Koku!\"\\n\\nTom stared at the colored man in amazement.\\n\\n\"No wonder you got a shock!\" exclaimed the young inventor. \"You\\ndidn\\'t get all the thousand volts, for part of it was shunted off;\\nbut you got a good charge, all right. So that\\'s what did the\\nbusiness; eh? It was the combination of the two electrical\\ncircuits that sent the photograph over the wire.\"\\n\\n\"I understand it now, Rad; but you did more than I\\'ve been able to\\ndo. I never, in a hundred years, would have thought of switching\\non that current. It never occurred to me. But you, doing it by\\naccident, brought out the truth. It\\'s often that way in\\ndiscoveries. And Koku was standing in the other telephone booth,\\nnear the plate there, when you switched in this current, Rad?\"\\n\\n\"Yas, sah, Massa Tom. He were. An\\' yo\\' ought t\\' see him hop when\\nhe heard mah voice yellin\\' at him. Ha! ha! ha!\"\\n\\nEradicate chuckled at the thought. Then a pain in his shocked arm\\nmade him wince. A wry look passed over his face.\\n\\n\"Yas, sah, Koku done jump about ten feet,\" he said. \"An\\'--an\\' den\\nI jump too. Ain\\'t no use in denyin\\' dat fact. I done jump when I\\ngot dat shock!\"\\n\\n\"All right, Rad. You may go now. I think I\\'m on the right track!\"\\nexclaimed Tom. \"Come on, Ned, we\\'ll try some experiments, and\\nwe\\'ll see what we can do.\"\\n\\n\"No shocks though--cut out the shocks, Tom,\" stipulated his chum.\\n\\n\"Oh, sure! No shocks! Now crowding busy and improve on\\nEradicate\\'s Angel Gabriel system.\"\\n\\nTom made a quick examination of the apparatus.\\n\\n\"I understand it, I think,\" he said. \"Koku was near the plate in\\nthe other booth when Rad put on the double current. There was a\\nlight there, and in an instant his likeness was sent over the\\nwire, and imprinted on this plate. Now let\\'s see what we can do.\\nYou go to that other booth, Ned. I\\'ll see if I can get your\\npicture, and send you mine. Here, take some extra selenium plates\\nalong. You know how to connect them.\"\\n\\n\"I think so,\" answered Ned.\\n\\n\"This image is really too faint to be of much use,\" went on Tom,\\nas he looked at the one of Koku. \"I think I can improve on it. But\\nwe\\'re on the right track.\"\\n\\nA little later Ned stood in the other booth, while Tom arranged\\nthe wires, and made the connections in the way accidently\\ndiscovered by Eradicate. The young inventor had put in a new\\nplate, carefully putting away the one with the picture of the\\ngiant, This plate could be used again, when the film, into which\\nthe image was imprinted, had been washed off.\\n\\n\"All ready, Ned,\" called Tom, over the wire, when he was about to\\nturn the switch. \"Stand still, and I\\'ll get you.\"\\n\\nThe connection was made, and Tom uttered a cry of joy. For there,\\nstaring at him from the plate in front of him was the face of Ned.\\n\\nIt was somewhat reduced in size, of course, and was not extra\\nclear, but anyone who knew Ned could have told he was at the other\\nend of the wire.\\n\\n\"Do you get me, Tom?\" called Ned, over the telephone.\\n\\n\"I sure do! Now see if you can get me.\"\\n\\nTom made other connections, and then looked at the sending plate\\nof his instrument, there being both a sending and receiving plate\\nin each booth, just as there was a receiver and a transmitter to\\nthe telephone.\\n\\n\"Hurray! I see you, Tom!\" cried Ned, over the wire. \"Say, this is\\ngreat!\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t as good as I want it,\" went on Tom. \"But it proves that\\nI\\'m right. The photo telephone is a fact, and now persons using\\nthe wire can be sure of the other person they are conversing with.\\nI must tell dad. He wouldn\\'t believe I could do it!\"\\n\\nAnd indeed Mr. Swift was surprised when Tom proved, by actual\\ndemonstration, that a picture could be sent over the wire.\\n\\n\"Tom, I congratulate you!\" declared the aged inventor. \"It is good\\nnews!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but we have bad news of Mr. Damon,\" said Tom, and he told\\nhis father of the disappearance of the eccentric man. Mr. Swift at\\nonce telephoned his sympathy to Mrs. Damon, and offered to do\\nanything he could for her.\\n\\n\"But Tom can help you more than I can,\" he said. \"You can depend\\non Tom.\"\\n\\n\"I know that,\" replied Mrs. Damon, over the wire.\\n\\nAnd certainly Tom Swift had many things to do now. He hardly knew\\nat what to begin first, but now, since he was on the right road in\\nregard to his photo telephone, he would work at improving it.\\n\\nAnd to this end he devoted himself, after he had sent out a\\ngeneral alarm to the police of nearby towns, in regard to the\\ndisappearance of Mr. Damon. The airship clue, he believed, as did\\nthe police, would be a good one to work on.\\n\\nFor several days after this nothing of moment occurred. Mr. Damon\\ncould not be located, and Tom\\'s airship might still be sailing\\nabove the clouds as far as getting any trace of it was concerned.\\n\\nMeanwhile the young inventor, with the help of Ned, who was given\\na leave of absence from the bank, worked hard to improve the photo\\ntelephone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\nTHE AIRSHIP CLUE\\n\\n\\n\"Now Ned, we\\'ll try again. I\\'m going to use a still stronger\\ncurrent, and this is the most sensitive selenium plate I\\'ve turned\\nout yet. We\\'ll see if we can\\'t get a better likeness of you--one\\nthat will be plainer.\"\\n\\nIt was Tom Swift who was speaking, and he and his chum had just\\ncompleted some hard work on the new photo telephone. Though the\\napparatus did what Tom had claimed for it, still he was far from\\nsatisfied. He could transmit over the wire the picture of a person\\ntalking at the telephone, but the likeness was too faint to make\\nthe apparatus commercially profitable.\\n\\n\"It\\'s like the first moving pictures,\" said Tom. \"They moved, but\\nthat was about all they did.\"\\n\\n\"I say,\" remarked Ned, as he was about to take his place in the\\nbooth where the telephone and apparatus were located, \"this\\ndouble-strength electrical current you\\'re speaking of won\\'t shock\\nme; will it? I don\\'t want what happened to Eradicate to happen to\\nme, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry. Nothing will happen. The trouble with Rad was that\\nhe didn\\'t have the wires insulated when he turned that arc current\\nswitch by mistake--or, rather, to play his joke. But he\\'s all\\nright now.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I\\'m not going to take any chances,\" insisted Ned. \"I\\nwant to be insulated myself.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll see to that,\" promised Tom. \"Now get to your booth.\"\\n\\nFor the purpose of experiments Tom had strung a new line between\\ntwo of his shops, They were both within sight, and the line was\\nnot very long; but, as I have said, Tom knew that if his apparatus\\nwould work over a short distance, it would also be successful over\\na long one, provided he could maintain the proper force of\\ncurrent, which he was sure could be accomplished.\\n\\n\"And if they can send pictures from Monte Carlo to Paris I can do\\nthe same,\" declared Tom, though his system of photo telephony was\\ndifferent from sending by a telegraph system--a reproduction of a\\npicture on a copper plate. Tom\\'s apparatus transmitted the\\nlikeness of the living person.\\n\\nIt took some little time for the young inventor, and Ned working\\nwith him, to fix up the new wires and switch on the current. But\\nat last it was complete, and Ned took his place at one telephone,\\nwith the two sensitive plates before him. Tom did the same, and\\nthey proceeded to talk over the wire, first making sure that the\\nvocal connection was perfect.\\n\\n\"All ready now, Ned! We\\'ll try it,\" called Tom to his chum, over\\nthe wire. \"Look straight at the plate. I want to get your image\\nfirst, and then I\\'ll send mine, if it\\'s a success.\"\\n\\nNed did as requested, and in a few minutes he could hear Tom\\nexclaim, joyfully:\\n\\n\"It\\'s better, Ned! It\\'s coming out real clear. I can see you\\nalmost as plainly as if you were right in the booth with me. But\\nturn on your light a little stronger.\"\\n\\nTom could hear, through the telephone, his chum moving about, and\\nthen he caught a startled exclamation.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Tom anxiously.\\n\\n\"I got a shock!\" cried Ned. \"I thought you said you had this thing\\nfixed. Great Scott, Tom! It nearly yanked the arm off me! Is this\\na joke?\"\\n\\n\"No, old man. No, of course not! Something must be wrong. I didn\\'t\\nmean that. Wait, I\\'ll take a look. Say, it does seem as if\\neverything was going wrong with this invention. But I\\'m on the\\nright track, and soon I\\'ll have it all right. Wait a second. I\\'ll\\nbe right over.\"\\n\\nTom found that it was only a simple displacement of a wire that\\nhad given Ned a shock, and he soon had this remedied.\\n\\n\"Now we\\'ll try again,\" he said. This time nothing wrong occurred,\\nand soon Tom saw the clearest image he had yet observed on his\\ntelephone photo plate.\\n\\n\"Switch me on now, Ned,\" he called to his chum, and Ned reported\\nthat he could see Tom very plainly.\\n\\n\"So far--so good,\" observed Tom, as he came from the booth. \"But\\nthere are several things I want yet to do.\"\\n\\n\"Such as what?\" questioned Ned.\\n\\n\"Well, I want to arrange to have two kinds of pictures come over\\nthe wire. I want it so that a person can go into a booth, call up\\na friend, and then switch on the picture plate, so he can see his\\nfriend as well as talk to him. I want this plate to be like a\\nmirror, so that any number of images can be made to appear on it.\\nIn that way it can be used over and over again. In fact it will be\\nexactly like a mirror, or a telescope. No matter how far two\\npersons may be apart they can both see and talk to one another.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s a big contract, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but you\\'ve seen that it can be done. Then another thing I\\nwant to do is to have it arranged so that I can make a photograph\\nof a person over a wire.\"\\n\\n\"Meaning what?\"\\n\\n\"Meaning that if a certain person talks to me over the wire, I can\\nturn my switch, and get a picture of him here at my apparatus\\nconnected with my telephone. To do that I\\'ll merely need a sending\\napparatus at the other end of the telephone line--not a receiving\\nmachine.\"\\n\\n\"Could you arrange it so that the person who was talking to you\\nwould have his picture taken whether he wanted it or not?\" asked\\nNed.\\n\\n\"Yes, it might be done,\" spoke Tom, thoughtfully. \"I could conceal\\nthe sending plate somewhere in the telephone booth, and arrange\\nthe proper light, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\"That might be a good way in which to catch a criminal,\" went on\\nNed. \"Often crooks call up on the telephone, but they know they\\nare safe. The authorities can\\'t see them--they can only hear them.\\nNow if you could get a photograph of them while they were\\ntelephoning--\"\\n\\n\"I see!\" cried Tom, excitedly. \"That\\'s a great idea! I\\'ll work on\\nthat, Ned.\"\\n\\nAnd, all enthusiasm, Tom began to plan new schemes with his photo\\ntelephone.\\n\\nThe young inventor did not forget his promise to help Mrs. Damon.\\nBut he could get absolutely no clue to her husband\\'s whereabouts.\\nMr. Damon had completely and mysteriously disappeared. His\\nfortune, too, seemed to have been swallowed up by the sharpers,\\nthough lawyers engaged by Tom could fasten no criminal acts on Mr.\\nPeters, who indignantly denied that he had done anything unlawful.\\n\\nIf he had, he had done it in such a way that he could not be\\nbrought to justice. The promoter was still about Shopton, as well\\ngroomed as ever, with his rose in his buttonhole, and wearing his\\nsilk hat. He still speeded up and down Lake Carlopa in his\\npowerful motor boat. But he gave Tom Swift a wide berth.\\n\\nLate one night, when Tom and Ned had been working at the new photo\\ntelephone, after all the rest of the household had retired, Tom\\nsuddenly looked up from his drawings and exclaimed:\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s what?\" inquired Ned.\\n\\n\"That sound? Don\\'t you hear it? Listen!\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s an airship--maybe yours coming back!\" cried the young\\nbanker.\\n\\nAs he spoke Ned did hear, seemingly in the air above the house, a\\ncurious, throbbing, pulsating sound.\\n\\n\"That\\'s so! It is an airship motor!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Come on out!\"\\n\\nTogether they rushed from the house, but, ere they reached the\\nyard, the sound had ceased. They looked up into the sky, but could\\nsee nothing, though the night was light from a full moon.\\n\\n\"I certainly heard it,\" said Tom.\\n\\n\"So did I,\" asserted Ned. \"But where is it now?\"\\n\\nThey advanced toward the group of work-buildings. Something\\nshowing white in the moonlight, before the hangar, caught Ned\\'s\\neyes.\\n\\n\"Look!\" he exclaimed. \"There\\'s an airship, Tom!\"\\n\\nThe two rushed over to the level landing place before the big\\nshed. And there, as if she had just been run out for a flight, was\\nthe Eagle. She had come back in the night, as mysteriously as she\\nhad been taken away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nSUCCESS\\n\\n\\n\"Well, this gets me!\" exclaimed Tom.\\n\\n\"It sure is strange,\" agreed Ned. \"How did she come here?\"\\n\\n\"She didn\\'t come alone--that\\'s sure,\" went on Tom. \"Someone\\nbrought her here, made a landing, and got away before we could get\\nout.\"\\n\\nThe two chums were standing near the Eagle, which had come back so\\nmysteriously.\\n\\n\"Just a couple of seconds sooner and we\\'d have seen who brought\\nher here,\" went on Tom. \"But they must have shut off the motor\\nsome distance up, and then they volplaned down. That\\'s why we\\ndidn\\'t hear them.\"\\n\\nNed went over and put his hand on the motor.\\n\\n\"Ouch!\" he cried, jumping back. \"It\\'s hot!\"\\n\\n\"Showing that she\\'s been running up to within a few minutes ago,\"\\nsaid Tom. \"Well, as I said before, this sure does get me. First\\nthese mysterious men take my airship, and then they bring her back\\nagain, without so much as thanking me for the use of her.\"\\n\\n\"Who in the world can they be?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea. But I\\'m going to find out, if it\\'s at\\nall possible. We\\'ll look the machine over in the morning, and see\\nif we can get any clues. No use in doing that now. Come on, we\\'ll\\nput her back in the hangar.\"\\n\\n\"Say!\" exclaimed Ned, as a sudden idea came to him. \"It couldn\\'t\\nbe Mr. Damon who had your airship; could it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. Why do you ask that?\"\\n\\n\"Well, he might have wanted to get away from his enemies for a\\nwhile, and he might have taken your Eagle, and--\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Damon wouldn\\'t trail along with a crowd like the one that\\ntook away my airship,\" said Tom, decidedly. \"You\\'ve got another\\nguess coming, Ned. Mr. Damon had nothing to do with this.\"\\n\\n\"And yet the night he disappeared an airship was heard near his\\nhouse.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so. Well, I give up. This is sure a mystery. We\\'ll have a\\nlook at it in the morning. One thing I\\'ll do, though, I\\'ll\\ntelephone over to Mr. Damon\\'s house and see if his wife has heard\\nany news. I\\'ve been doing that quite often of late, so she won\\'t\\nthink anything of it. In that way we can find out if he had\\nanything to do with my airship. But let\\'s run her into the shed\\nfirst.\"\\n\\nThis was done, and Koku, the giant, was sent to sleep in the\\nhangar to guard against another theft. But it was not likely that\\nthe mysterious men, once having brought the airship back, would\\ncome for it again.\\n\\nTom called up Mrs. Damon on the telephone, but there was no news\\nof the missing man. He expressed his sympathy, and said he would\\ncome and see her soon. He told Mrs. Damon not to get discouraged,\\nadding that he, and others, were doing all that was possible. But,\\nin spite of this, Mrs. Damon, naturally, did worry.\\n\\nThe next morning the two chums inspected the airship, so\\nmysteriously returned to them. Part after part they went over, and\\nfound nothing wrong. The motor ran perfectly, and there was not so\\nmuch as a bent spoke in the landing wheels. For all that could be\\ntold by an inspection of the craft she might never have been out\\nof the hangar.\\n\\n\"Hello, here\\'s something!\" cried Tom, as he got up from the\\noperator\\'s seat, where he had taken his place to test the various\\ncontrols.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"A button. A queer sort of a button. I never had any like that on\\nmy clothes, and I\\'m sure you didn\\'t. Look!\" and Tom held out a\\nlarge, metal button of curious design.\\n\\n\"It must have come off the coat of one of the men who had your\\nairship, Tom,\" said his chum. \"Save it. You may find that it\\'s a\\nclue.\"\\n\\n\"I will. No telling what it may lead to. Well, I guess that\\'s all\\nwe can find.\"\\n\\nAnd it was. But Tom little realized what a clue the button was\\ngoing to be. Nothing more could be learned by staring at the\\nreturned airship, so he and Ned went back to the house.\\n\\nTom Swift had many things to do, but his chief concern was for the\\nphoto telephone. Now that he was near the goal of success he\\nworked harder than ever. The idea Ned had given him of being able\\nto take the picture of a person at the instrument--without the\\nknowledge of that person--appealed strongly to Tom.\\n\\n\"That\\'s going to be a valuable invention!\" he declared, but little\\nhe knew how valuable it would prove to him and to others.\\n\\nIt was about a week later when Tom was ready to try the new\\napparatus. Meanwhile he had prepared different plates, and had\\nchanged his wiring system. In the days that had passed nothing new\\nhad been learned concerning the whereabouts of Mr. Damon, nor of\\nthe men who had so mysteriously taken away Tom\\'s airship.\\n\\nAll was in readiness for the trial. Tom sent Ned to the booth that\\nhe had constructed in the airship hangar, some distance away from\\nthe house. The other booth Tom had placed in his library, an\\nentirely new system of wires being used.\\n\\n\"Now Ned,\" explained Tom, \"the idea is this! You go into that\\nbooth, just as if it were a public one, and ring me up in the\\nregular way. Of course we haven\\'t a central here, but that doesn\\'t\\nmatter. Now while I\\'m talking to you I want to see you. You don\\'t\\nknow that, of course.\"\\n\\n\"The point is to see if I can get your picture while you\\'re\\ntalking to me, and not let you know a thing about it.\"\\n\\n\"Think you can do it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to try. We\\'ll soon know. Go ahead.\"\\n\\nA little later Ned was calling up his chum, as casually as he\\ncould, under the circumstances.\\n\\n\"All right!\" called Tom to his chum. \"Start in and talk. Say\\nanything you like--it doesn\\'t matter. I want to see if I can get\\nyour picture. Is the light burning in your booth?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"All right then. Go ahead.\"\\n\\nNed talked of the weather--of anything. Meanwhile Tom was busy.\\nConcealed in the booth occupied by Ned was a sending plate. It\\ncould not be seen unless one knew just where to look for it. In\\nTom\\'s booth was a receiving plate.\\n\\nThe experiment did not take long. Presently Tom called to Ned that\\nhe need stay there no longer.\\n\\n\"Come on to the house,\" invited the young inventor, \"and we\\'ll\\ndevelope this plate.\" For in this system it was necessary to\\ndevelope the receiving plate, as is done with an ordinary\\nphotographic one. Tom wanted a permanent record.\\n\\nEagerly the chums in the dark room looked down into the tray\\ncontaining the plate and the developing solution.\\n\\n\"Something\\'s coming out!\" cried Ned, eagerly.\\n\\n\"Yes! And it\\'s you!\" exclaimed Tom. \"See, Ned, I got your picture\\nover the telephone. Success! I\\'ve struck it! This is the best\\nyet!\"\\n\\nAt that moment, as the picture came out more and more plainly,\\nsomeone knocked on the door of the dark room.\\n\\n\"Who is it?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\"Gen\\'man t\\' see you,\" said Eradicate. \"He say he come from Mistah\\nPeters!\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Peters--that rascally promoter!\" whispered Tom to his chum.\\n\"What does this mean?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\nTHE MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE\\n\\n\\nTom Swift and his chum looked at one another strangely for a\\nmoment in the dim, red light of the dark room. Then the young\\ninventor spoke:\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to see him. Tell him so, Rad!\"\\n\\n\"Hold on a second,\" suggested Ned. \"Maybe you had better see him,\\nTom. It may have something to with Mr. Damon\\'s lost fortune.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so! I didn\\'t think of that. And I may get a clue to his\\ndisappearance, though I don\\'t imagine Peters had anything to do\\nwith that. Wait, Rad. Tell the gentleman I\\'ll see him. Did he give\\nany name, Rad?\"\\n\\n\"Yas, sah. Him done say him Mistah Boylan.\"\\n\\n\"The same man who called to see me once before, trying to get me\\nto do some business with Peters,\" murmured Tom. \"Very well, I\\'ll\\nsee him as soon as this picture is fixed. Tell him to wait, Rad.\"\\n\\nA little later Tom went to where his caller awaited in the\\nlibrary. This time there were no plans to be looked at, the young\\ninventor having made a practice of keeping all his valuable papers\\nlocked in a safe.\\n\\n\"You go into the next room, Ned,\" Tom had said to his chum. \"Leave\\nthe door open, so you can hear what is said.\"\\n\\n\"Why, do you think there\\'ll be trouble? Maybe we\\'d better have\\nKoku on hand to--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, nothing like that,\" laughed Tom. \"I just want you to\\nlisten to what\\'s said so, if need be, you can be a witness later.\\nI don\\'t know what their game is, but I don\\'t trust Peters and his\\ncrowd. They may want to get control of some of my patents, and\\nthey may try some underhanded work. If they do I want to be in a\\nposition to stop them.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" agreed Ned, and he took his place.\\n\\nBut Mr. Boylan\\'s errand was not at all sensational, it would seem.\\nHe bowed to Tom, perhaps a little distantly, for they had not\\nparted the best of friends on a former occasion.\\n\\n\"I suppose you are surprised to see me,\" began Mr. Boylan.\\n\\n\"Well, I am, to tell the truth,\" Tom said, calmly.\\n\\n\"I am here at the request of my employer, Mr. Peters,\" went on the\\ncaller. \"He says he is forming a new and very powerful company to\\nexploit airships, and he wants to know whether you would not\\nreconsider your determination not to let him do some business for\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m afraid I don\\'t care to go into anything like that,\" said\\nTom.\\n\\n\"It would be a good thing for you,\" proceeded Mr. Boylan, eagerly.\\n\"Mr. Peters is able to command large capital, and if you would\\npermit the use of your airships--or one of them--as a model, and\\nwould supervise the construction of others, we could confidently\\nexpect large sales. Thus you would profit, and I am frank to admit\\nthat the company, and Mr. Peters, also, would make money. Mr.\\nPeters is perfectly free to confess that he is in business to make\\nmoney, but he is also willing to let others share with him. Come\\nnow, what do you say?\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry, but I shall have to say the same thing I said\\nbefore,\" replied Tom. \"Nothing doing!\"\\n\\nMr. Boylan glanced rather angrily at the young inventor, and then,\\nwith a shrug of his shoulders, remarked:\\n\\n\"Well, you have the say, of course. But I would like to remind you\\nthat this is going to be a very large airship company, and if your\\ninventions are not exploited some others will be. And Mr. Peters\\nalso desired me to say that this is the last offer he would make\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Tell him,\" said Tom, \"that I am much obliged, but that I have no\\nbusiness that I can entrust to him. If he wishes to make some\\nother type of airship, that is his affair. Good-day.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Boylan was going out Tom noticed a button dangling from the\\nback of his caller\\'s coat. It hung by a thread, being one of the\\npair usually sewed on the back of a cutaway garment.\\n\\n\"I think you had better take off that button before it falls,\"\\nsuggested Tom. \"You may lose it, and perhaps it would be hard to\\nmatch.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s so. Thank you!\" said Mr. Boylan. He tried to reach around\\nand get it, but he was too stout to turn easily, especially as the\\ncoat was tight-fitting.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get it for you,\" offered Tom, as he pulled it off. \"There is\\none missing, though,\" he said, as he handed the button to the man.\\nAnd then Tom started as he saw the pattern of the one in his hand.\\n\\n\"One gone? That\\'s too bad,\" murmured Mr. Boylan. \"Those buttons\\nwere imported, and I doubt if I can replace them. They are rather\\nodd.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tom, gazing as if fascinated at the one he still\\nheld. \"They are rather odd.\"\\n\\nAnd then, as he passed it over, like a flash it came to him where\\nhe had seen a button like that before. He had found it in his\\nairship, which had been so mysteriously taken away and returned.\\n\\nTom could hardly restrain his impatience until Mr. Boylan had\\ngone. The young inventor had half a notion to produce the other\\nbutton, matching the one he had just pulled off his visitor\\'s\\ncoat, and tell where he had found it. But he held himself back. He\\nwanted to talk first to Ned.\\n\\nAnd, when his chum came in, Tom cried:\\n\\n\"Ned, what do you think? I know who had my airship!\"\\n\\n\"How?\" asked Ned, in wonder.\\n\\n\"By that button clue! Yes, it\\'s the same kind--they\\'re as alike as\\ntwins!\" and Tom brought out the button which he had put away in\\nhis desk. \"See, Boylan had one just like this on the back of his\\ncoat. The other was missing. Here it is--it was in the seat of my\\nairship, where it was probably pulled off as he moved about. Ned,\\nI think I\\'ve got the right clue at last.\"\\n\\nNed said nothing for several seconds. Then he remarked slowly:\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, it proves one thing; but not the other.\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I mean that it may be perfectly true that the button came off Mr.\\nBoylan\\'s coat, but that doesn\\'t prove that he wore it. You can be\\nreasonably sure that the coat was having a ride in your Eagle, but\\nwas Boylan in the coat? That\\'s the question.\"\\n\\n\"In the coat? Of course he was in it!\" cried Tom.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t be sure. Someone may have borrowed his coat to take a\\nmidnight ride in the airship.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Boylan doesn\\'t look to be the kind of a man who would lend\\nhis clothes,\" remarked Tom.\\n\\n\"You never can tell. Someone may have borrowed it without his\\nknowledge. You\\'d better go a bit slow, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Well, maybe I had. But it\\'s a clue, anyhow.\"\\n\\nNed agreed to this.\\n\\n\"And all I\\'ve got to do is to find out who was in the coat when it\\nwas riding about in my airship,\" went on Tom.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Ned, \"and then maybe you\\'ll have some clue to the\\ndisappearance of Mr. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"Right you are! Come on, let\\'s get busy!\"\\n\\n\"As if we hadn\\'t been busy all the while!\" laughed Ned. \"I\\'ll lose\\nmy place at the bank if I don\\'t get back soon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, stay a little longer--a few days,\" urged Tom. \"I\\'m sure that\\nsomething is going to happen soon. Anyhow my photo telephone is\\nabout perfected. But I\\'ve just thought of another improvement.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to arrange a sort of dictaphone, or phonograph, so I\\ncan get a permanent record of what a person says over the wire, as\\nwell as get a picture of him saying it. Then everything will be\\ncomplete. This last won\\'t be hard to do, as there are several\\nmachines on the market now, for preserving a record of telephone\\nconversations. I\\'ll make mine a bit different, though.\"\\n\\n\"Tom, is there any limit to what you\\'re going to do?\" asked Ned,\\nadmiringly.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I\\'m going to stop soon, and retire,\" laughed the young\\ninventor.\\n\\nAfter talking the matter over, Tom and his chum decided to wait a\\nday or so before taking any action in regard to the button clue to\\nthe takers of the airship. After all, no great harm had been done,\\nand Tom was more anxious to locate Mr. Damon, and try to get back\\nhis fortune, as well as to perfect his photo telephone, than he\\nwas to discover those who had helped themselves to the Eagle.\\n\\nTom and Ned put in some busy days, arranging the phonograph\\nattachment. It was easy, compared to the hard work of sending a\\npicture over the wire. They paid several visits to Mrs. Damon, but\\nshe had no news of her missing husband, and, as the days went by,\\nshe suffered more and more under the strain.\\n\\nFinally Tom\\'s new invention was fully completed. It was a great\\nsuccess, and he not only secured pictures of Ned and others over\\nthe wire, as he talked to them, but he imprinted on wax cylinders,\\nto be reproduced later, the very things they said.\\n\\nIt was a day or so after he had demonstrated his new attachment\\nfor the first time, that Tom received a most urgent message from\\nMrs. Damon.\\n\\n\"Tom,\" she said, over the telephone, \"I wish you would call.\\nSomething very mysterious has happened.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Damon hasn\\'t come back; has he?\" asked Tom eagerly.\\n\\n\"No--but I wish I could say he had. This concerns him, however.\\nCan you come?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll be there right away.\"\\n\\nIn his speedy monoplane Tom soon reached Waterford. Ned did not\\naccompany him this time.\\n\\n\"Now what is it, Mrs. Damon?\" asked the young inventor.\\n\\n\"About half an hour before I called you,\" she said, \"I received a\\nmysterious message.\"\\n\\n\"Who brought it?\" asked Tom quickly.\\n\\n\"No one. It came over the telephone. Someone, whose voice I did\\nnot know, said to me: \\'Sign the land papers, and send them to us,\\nand your husband will be released.\\'\"\\n\\n\"That message came over the wire?\" cried Tom, excitedly.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"Oh, I am so frightened! I don\\'t know\\nwhat to do!\" and the lady burst into tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\nANOTHER CALL\\n\\n\\nTom Swift, for the moment, did not know what to do. It was a\\nstrange situation, and one he had never thought of. What did the\\nmysterious message mean? He must think it all out, and plan some\\nline of action. Clearly Mrs. Damon was not able to do so.\\n\\n\"Now let\\'s get at this in some kind of order,\" suggested the\\nyouth, when Mrs. Damon had calmed herself. It was his habit to\\nhave a method about doing things. \"And don\\'t worry,\" he advised.\\n\"I am certain some good will come of this. It proves one thing,\\nthat\\'s sure.\"\\n\\n\"What is it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"That Mr. Damon is alive and well. Otherwise the message would not\\nhave said he would be \\'released.\\' It wasn\\'t from anyone you know;\\nwas it?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m sure I never heard the voice before.\"\\n\\nTom paused a moment to think how useful his photo telephone and\\nphonograph arrangement might have been in this case.\\n\\n\"How did the telephone call come in?\" inquired the young inventor.\\n\\n\"In the usual way,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"The bell rang, and, as I\\nhappened to be near the instrument, I answered it, as I often do,\\nwhen the maid is busy. A voice asked if I was Mrs. Damon, and of\\ncourse I said I was. Then I heard this: \\'Sign the land papers, and\\nsend them to us, and your husband will be released.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Was that all?\" Tom asked.\\n\\n\"I think so--I made a note of it at the time.\" Mrs. Damon looked\\ninto a small red book. \"No, that wasn\\'t all,\" she said, quickly.\\n\"I was so astonished, at hearing those strange words about my\\nhusband, that I didn\\'t know what to say. Before I could ask any\\nquestions the voice went on to say, rather abruptly: \\'We will call\\nyou again.\\'\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s good!\" cried Tom. \"I only hope they do it while I am here.\\nPerhaps I can get some clue as to who it was called you. But was\\nthis all you heard?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m sure that was all. I had forgotten about the last words,\\nbut I see I have them written down in my note book.\"\\n\\n\"Did you ask any questions?\" inquired Tom.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed I did! As soon as I got over being stunned by what I\\nheard, I asked all sorts of questions. I demanded to know who was\\nspeaking, what they meant, where they were, and all that. I begged\\nthem to tell me something of my husband.\"\\n\\n\"And what did they say?\"\\n\\n\"Not a thing. There wasn\\'t a sound in the telephone. The receiver\\nwas hung up, breaking the connection after that message to me--that\\nmysterious message.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it was mysterious,\" agreed Tom, thoughtfully. \"I can\\'t\\nunderstand it. But didn\\'t you try to learn from the central\\noperator where the call had come from?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, indeed, Tom! As soon as I found out the person speaking\\nto me had rung off, I got the girl in the exchange.\"\\n\\n\"And what did she say?\"\\n\\n\"That the call came from an automatic pay station in a drug store\\nin town. I have the address. It was one of those telephones where\\nyou put your money for the call in a slot.\"\\n\\n\"I see. Well, the first thing to do is for me to go to that drug\\nstore and find out, if I can, who used the telephone about that\\ntime. It\\'s a slim chance, but we\\'ll have to take it. Was it a\\nman\\'s voice, or a woman\\'s?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, a man\\'s, I\\'m sure. It was very deep and heavy. No woman could\\nspeak like that.\"\\n\\n\"So much is settled, anyhow. Now about the land papers--what was\\nmeant?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" said Mrs. Damon. \"You know part of our\\nproperty--considerable land and some buildings--is in my name. Mr. Damon\\nhad it fixed so a number of years ago, in order to protect me. No one\\ncould get this property, and land, unless I signed the deeds, or\\nagreed to sign them. Now all of Mr. Damon\\'s fortune is tied up in\\nsome of Mr. Peters\\'s companies. That is why my husband has\\ndisappeared.\"\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t disappear--he was taken away against his will; I\\'m\\npositive of that!\" exclaimed Tom.\\n\\n\"Perhaps so,\" agreed Mrs. Damon, sadly. \"But those are the papers\\nreferred to, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\"Probably,\" assented Tom. \"The rascals want to get control of\\neverything--even your possessions. Not satisfied with ruining Mr.\\nDamon, they want to make you a beggar, too. So they are playing on\\nyour fears. They promise to release your husband if you will give\\nthem the land.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, that must be it, Tom. What would you advise me to do? I am\\nso frightened over this!\"\\n\\n\"Do? Don\\'t you do anything!\" cried Tom. \"We\\'ll fool these rascals\\nyet. If they got those papers they might release Mr. Damon, or\\nthey might not--fearing he would cause their arrest later. But\\nwe\\'ll have him released anyhow, and we\\'ll save what is left of\\nyour fortune. Put those land papers in a safe-deposit box, and let\\nme do the rest. I\\'m going to catch those fellows!\"\\n\\n\"But how, Tom? You don\\'t know who they are. And a mere message\\nover a telephone won\\'t give you a clue to where they are.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps not an ordinary message,\" agreed Tom. \"But I\\'m going to\\ntry some of my new inventions. You said they told you they were\\ngoing to call again?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what they said, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Well, when they do, I want to be here. I want to listen to that\\nmessage. If you will allow me, I\\'ll take up my residence here for\\na while, Mrs. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"Allow you? I\\'ll be only too glad if you will, Tom. But I thought\\nyou were going to try to get some clue from the drug store where\\nthe mysterious message came from.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll let Ned Newton do that. I want to stay here.\"\\n\\nTom telephoned to Ned to meet him at Mrs. Damon\\'s house, and also\\nto bring with him certain things from the laboratory. And when Ned\\narrived in an auto, with various bits of apparatus, Tom put in\\nsome busy hours.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned was sent to the drug store, to see if any clues\\ncould be obtained there as to who had sent the message. As Tom had\\nfeared, nothing could be learned. There were several automatic\\n\\'phones in the place, and they were used very often during the day\\nby the public. The drug clerks took little or no notice of the\\npersons entering or leaving the booths, since the dropping of a\\ncoin in the slot was all that was necessary to be connected with\\ncentral.\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve got to wait for the second call here,\" said Tom, who\\nhad been busy during Ned\\'s absence. He had fitted to Mrs. Damon\\'s\\ntelephone a recording wax phonograph cylinder, to get a record of\\nthe speaker\\'s voice. And he had also put in an extension\\ntelephone, so that he could listen while Mrs. Damon talked to the\\nunknown.\\n\\n\"There, I guess we\\'re ready for them,\" said Tom, late that\\nafternoon. But no queer call came in that day. It was the next\\nmorning, about ten o\\'clock, after Mrs. Damon had passed a restless\\nnight, that the telephone bell rang. Tom, who was on the alert,\\nwas at his auxiliary instrument in a flash. He motioned to Mrs.\\nDamon to answer on the main wire.\\n\\n\"Hello,\" she spoke into the transmitter. \"Who is this?\"\\n\\n\"Are you Mrs. Damon?\" Tom heard come over the wire in a deep\\nvoice, and by the manner in which Mrs. Damon signalled the young\\ninventor knew that, at the other end of the line, was the\\nmysterious man who had spoken before.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\nTHE BUZZING SOUND\\n\\n\\n\"Are you Mrs. Damon?\" came the question again--rather more\\nimpatiently this time, Tom thought.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the lady, glancing over at Tom. The extension\\ntelephone was in the same room. Softly Tom switched on the\\nphonograph attachment. The little wax cylinder began to revolve\\nnoiselessly, ready to record the faintest word that came over the\\nwire.\\n\\n\"You got a message from me yesterday,\" went on the hoarse voice.\\nIn vain Tom tried to recall whether or not he had heard it before.\\nHe could not place it.\\n\\n\"Who are you?\" asked Mrs. Damon. She and Tom had previously agreed\\non a line of talk. \"Tell me your name, please.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s no need for any names to be used,\" went on the unknown at\\nthe other end of the wire. \"You heard what I said yesterday. Are\\nyou willing to send me those land title papers, if we release your\\nhusband?\"\\n\\n\"But where shall I send them?\" asked Mrs. Damon, to gain time.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be told where. And listen--no tricks! You needn\\'t try to\\nfind out who I am, nor where I am. Just send those papers if you\\nwant to see your husband again.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, how is he? Tell me about him! You are cruel to keep him a\\nprisoner like this! I demand that you release him!\"\\n\\nTom had not told Mrs. Damon to say this. It came out of her own\\nheart--she could not prevent the agonized outburst.\\n\\n\"Never mind about that, now,\" came the gruff voice over the wire.\\n\"Are you willing to send the papers?\"\\n\\nMrs. Damon looked over to Tom for silent instructions. He nodded\\nhis head in assent.\\n\\n\"Yes, I--I will send them if you tell me where to get them to you--if\\nyou will release Mr. Damon,\" said the anxious wife. \"But tell\\nme who you are--and where you are!\" she begged.\\n\\n\"None of that! I\\'m not looking to be arrested. You get the papers\\nready, and I\\'ll let you know to-morrow, about this time, where to\\nsend them.\"\\n\\n\"Wait a minute!\" called Mrs. Damon, to gain more time. \"I must\\nknow just what papers you want.\"\\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll tell you,\" and he began to describe the different\\nones.\\n\\nIt took a little time for the unknown to give this information to\\nMrs. Damon. The man was very particular about the papers. There\\nwere trust deeds, among other things, and he probably thought that\\nonce he had possession of them, with Mrs. Damon\\'s signature, even\\nthough it had been obtained under a threat, he could claim the\\nproperty. Later it was learned that such was not the case, for\\nMrs. Damon, with Tom\\'s aid, could have proved the fraud, had the\\nscoundrels tried to get the remainder of the Damon fortune.\\n\\nBut at the time it seemed to the helpless woman that everything\\nshe owned would be taken from her. Though she said she did not\\ncare, as long as Mr. Damon was restored to her.\\n\\nAs I have said, the telephoning of the instructions about the\\npapers took some time. Tom had counted on this, and had made his\\nplans accordingly.\\n\\nAs soon as the telephone call had come in, Tom had communicated\\nwith a private detective who was in waiting, and this man had gone\\nto the drug store whence the first call had come. He was going to\\ntry to make the arrest of the man telephoning.\\n\\nBut for fear the scoundrel would go to a different instrument, Tom\\ntook another precaution. This was to have one of the operators in\\nthe central exchange on the watch. As soon as Mrs. Damon\\'s house\\nwas in connection with another telephone, the location of the\\nlatter would be noted, and another private detective would be sent\\nthere. Thus Tom hoped to catch the man at the \\'phone.\\n\\nMeanwhile Tom listened to the hoarse voice at the other end of the\\nwire, giving the directions to Mrs. Damon. Tom hoped that soon\\nthere would be an arrest made.\\n\\nMeanwhile the talk was being faithfully recorded on the phonograph\\ncylinder. And, as the man talked on, Tom became aware of a curious\\nundercurrent of sound. It was a buzzing noise, that Tom knew did\\nnot come from the instrument itself. It was not the peculiar\\ntapping, singing noise heard in a telephone receiver, caused by\\ninduced electrical currents, or by wire trouble.\\n\\n\"This is certainly different,\" mused Tom. He was trying to recall\\nwhere he had heard the noise before. Sometimes it was faint, and\\nthen it would gradually increase, droning off into faintness once\\nmore. Occasionally it was so loud that Mrs. Damon could not hear\\nthe talk about the papers, and the man would have to repeat.\\n\\nBut finally he came to an end.\\n\\n\"This is all now,\" he said, sharply. Tom heard the words above the\\nqueer, buzzing, humming sound. \"You are keeping me too long. I\\nthink you are up to some game, but it won\\'t do you any good, Mrs.\\nDamon. I\\'ll \\'phone you to-morrow where to send the papers. And if\\nyou don\\'t send them--if you try any tricks--it will be the worse\\nfor you and Mr. Damon!\"\\n\\nThere was a click, that told of a receiver being placed back on\\nthe hook, and the voice ceased. So, also, did the queer, buzzing\\nsound over which Tom puzzled.\\n\\n\"What can it have been?\" he asked. \"Did you hear it, Mrs. Damon?\"\\n\\n\"What, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"That buzzing sound.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I heard, but I didn\\'t know what it was. Oh, Tom, what shall\\nI do?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll see if anything happened. They may have caught\\nthat fellow. If not I\\'ll plan another scheme.\"\\n\\nTom\\'s first act was to call up the telephone exchange to learn\\nwhere the second call had come from. He got the information at\\nonce. The address was in the suburbs. The man had not gone to the\\ndrug store this time.\\n\\n\"Did the detective get out to that address?\" asked Tom eagerly of\\nthe manager.\\n\\n\"Yes. As soon as we were certain that he was the party you wanted,\\nyour man got right after him, Mr. Swift.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s good, I hope he catches him!\" cried the young inventor. \"We\\'ll\\nhave to wait and find out.\"\\n\\n\"He said he\\'d call up and let you know as soon as he reached the\\nplace,\" the telephone manager informed Tom.\\n\\nThere was nothing to do but wait, and meanwhile Tom did what he\\ncould to comfort Mrs. Damon. She was quite nervous and inclined to\\nbe hysterical, and the youth thought it wise to have a cousin, who\\nhad come to stay with her, summon the doctor.\\n\\n\"But, Tom, what shall I do about those papers?\" Mrs. Damon asked\\nhim. \"Shall I send them?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed not!\"\\n\\n\"But I want Mr. Damon restored to me,\" she pleaded. \"I don\\'t care\\nabout the money. He can make more.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll not give those scoundrels the satisfaction of getting\\nany money out of you. Just wait now, I\\'ll work this thing out, and\\nfind a way to catch that fellow. If I could only think what that\\nbuzzing sound was--\"\\n\\nThen, in a flash, it came to Tom.\\n\\n\"A sawmill! A planing mill!\" he cried. \"That\\'s what it was! That\\nfellow was telephoning from some place near a sawmill!\"\\n\\nThe telephone rang in the midst of Tom\\'s excited comments.\\n\\n\"Yes--yes!\" he called eagerly. \"Who is it--what is it?\"\\n\\n\"This is Larsen--the private detective you sent.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, you were at the drug store.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Mr. Swift. Well, that party didn\\'t call up from here.\"\\n\\n\"I know, Larsen. It was from another station. We\\'re after him.\\nMuch obliged to you. Come on back.\"\\n\\nTom was sure his theory was right. The man had called up the Damon\\nhouse from some telephone near a sawmill. And a little later Tom\\'s\\ntheory was proved to be true. He got a report from the second\\ndetective. Unfortunately the man had not been able to reach the\\ntelephone station before the unknown speaker had departed.\\n\\n\"Was the place near a sawmill?\" asked Tom, eagerly.\\n\\n\"It was,\" answered the detective over the wire. \"The telephone is\\nright next door to one. It\\'s an automatic pay station and no one\\nseems to have noticed who the man was who telephoned. I couldn\\'t\\nget a single clue. I\\'m sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said Tom, as cheerfully as he could. \"I think I\\'m on\\nthe right track now. I\\'m going to lay a trap for this fellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\nSETTING THE TRAP\\n\\n\\nTroublesome problems seemed to be multiplying for Tom Swift. He\\nadmitted as much himself after the failure to capture the man who\\nhad telephoned to Mrs. Damon. He had hoped that his plan of\\nsending detectives to the location of the telephones would\\nsucceed. Since it had not the youth must try other means.\\n\\n\"Now, Ned,\" he said to his chum, when they were on their way from\\nMrs. Damon\\'s, it being impossible to do anything further there.\\n\"Now, Ned, we\\'ve got to think this thing out together.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m willing, Tom. I\\'ll do what I can.\"\\n\\n\"I know you will. Now the thing to do is to go at this thing\\nsystematically. Otherwise we\\'ll be working around in a circle, and\\nwon\\'t get anywhere. In the first place, let\\'s set down what we do\\nknow. Then we\\'ll put down what we don\\'t know, and go after that.\"\\n\\n\"Put down what you don\\'t know?\" exclaimed Ned. \"How are you going\\nto put down a thing when you don\\'t know it?\"\\n\\n\"I mean we can put a question mark after it, so to speak. For\\ninstance we don\\'t know where Mr. Damon is, but we want to find\\nout.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I see. Well, let\\'s start off with the things we do know.\"\\n\\nThe two friends were at Tom\\'s house by now, having come from\\nWaterford in Tom\\'s airship. After thinking over all the exciting\\nhappenings of the past few days, Tom remarked: \"Now, Ned, for the\\nthings we do know. In the first place Mr. Damon is missing, and\\nhis fortune is about gone. There is considerable left to Mrs.\\nDamon, however, but those scoundrels may get that away from her,\\nif we don\\'t watch out. Secondly, my airship was taken and brought\\nback, with a button more than it had when it went away. Said\\nbutton exactly matched one off Mr. Boylan\\'s coat.\"\\n\\n\"Thirdly, Mr. Damon was either taken away or went away, in an\\nairship--either in mine or someone else\\'s. Fourthly, Mrs. Damon\\nhas received telephonic communications from the man, or men, who\\nhave her husband. Fifthly, Mr. Peters, either legally or\\nillegally, is responsible for the loss of Mr. Damon\\'s fortune.\\nNow: there you are--for the things we do know.\"\\n\\n\"Now for the things we don\\'t know. We don\\'t know who has taken\\nMr. Damon away, nor where he is, to begin with the most important.\"\\n\\n\"Hold on, Tom, I think you\\'re wrong,\" broke in Ned.\\n\\n\"In what way?\"\\n\\n\"About not knowing who is responsible for the taking away of Mr.\\nDamon. I think it\\'s as plain as the nose on your face that Peters\\nis responsible.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see it that way,\" said Tom, quickly. \"I will admit that\\nit looks as though Boylan had been in my airship, but as for\\nPeters taking Mr. Damon away--why, Peters is around town all the\\nwhile, and if he had a hand in the disappearance of Mr. Damon, do\\nyou think he\\'d stay here, when he knows we are working on the\\ncase? And would he send Boylan to see me if Boylan had been one of\\nthose who had a hand in it? They wouldn\\'t dare, especially as they\\nknow I\\'m working on the case.\"\\n\\n\"Peters is a bad lot. I\\'ll grant you, though, he was fair enough\\nto pay for my motor boat. I don\\'t believe he had anything to do\\nwith taking Mr. Damon away.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he was the person who was talking to Mrs. Damon\\nabout the papers?\"\\n\\n\"No, Ned. I don\\'t. I listened to that fellow\\'s voice carefully. It\\nwasn\\'t like Peters\\'s. I\\'m going to put it in the phonograph, too,\\nand let you listen to it. Then see what you say.\"\\n\\nTom did this, a little later. The record of the voice, as it came\\nover the wire, was listened to from the wax cylinder, and Ned had\\nto admit that it was not much like that of the promoter.\\n\\n\"Well, what\\'s next to be done?\" asked the young banker.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to set a trap,\" replied Tom, with a grin.\\n\\n\"Set a trap?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a sort of mouse-trap. I\\'m glad my photo telephone is now\\nperfected, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"What has that got to do with it?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s going to be my trap, Ned. Here is my game. You know this\\nfellow--this strange unknown--is going to call up Mrs. Damon\\nto-morrow. Well, I\\'ll be ready for him. I\\'m going to put in the booth\\nwhere he will telephone from, one of my photo telephones--that is, the\\nsending apparatus. In Mrs. Damon\\'s house, attached to her telephone,\\nwill be the receiving plate, as well as the phonograph cylinder.\"\\n\\n\"When this fellow starts to talk he\\'ll be sending us his picture,\\nthough he won\\'t know it, and we\\'ll be getting a record of his\\nvoice. Then we\\'ll have him just where we want him.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\" cried Ned. \"But, Tom, there\\'s a weak spot in your mouse-trap.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"How are you going to know which telephone the unknown will call\\nup from? He may go to any of a hundred, more or less.\"\\n\\n\"He might--yes. But that\\'s a chance we\\'ve got to take. It isn\\'t so\\nmuch of a chance, though when you stop to think that he will\\nprobably go to some public telephone in an isolated spot, and,\\nunless I\\'m much mistaken he will go to a telephone near where he\\nwas to-day. He knows that was safe, since we didn\\'t capture him,\\nand he\\'s very likely to come back.\"\\n\\n\"But to make the thing as sure as possible, I\\'m going to attach my\\napparatus to a number of public telephones in the vicinity of the\\none near the sawmill. So if the fellow doesn\\'t get caught in one,\\nhe will in another. I admit it\\'s taking a chance; but what else\\ncan we do?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose you\\'re right, Tom. It\\'s like setting a number of\\ntraps.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. A trapper can\\'t be sure where he is going to get his\\ncatch, so he picks out the place, or run-way, where the game has\\nbeen in the habit of coming. He hides his traps about that place,\\nand trusts to luck that the animal will blunder into one of them.\"\\n\\n\"Criminals, to my way of thinking, are a good bit like animals.\\nThey seem to come back to their old haunts. Nearly any police\\nstory proves this. And it\\'s that on which I am counting to capture\\nthis criminal. So I\\'m going to fit up as many telephones with my\\nphoto and phonograph outfit, as I can in the time we have. You\\'ll\\nhave to help me. Luckily I\\'ve got plenty of selenium plates for\\nthe sending end. I\\'ll only need one at the receiving end. Now\\nwe\\'ll have to go and have a talk with the telephone manager, after\\nwhich we\\'ll get busy.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve overlooked one thing, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that, Ned?\"\\n\\n\"Why, if you know about which telephone this fellow is going to\\nuse, why can\\'t you have police stationed near it to capture him as\\nsoon as he begins to talk?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I did think of that, Ned; but it won\\'t work.\"\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\"Because, in the first place this man, or some of his friends,\\nwill be on the watch. When he goes into the place to telephone\\nthere\\'ll be a look-out, I\\'m sure, and he\\'d either put off talking\\nto Mrs. Damon, or he\\'d escape before we had any evidence against\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"You see I\\'ve got to get evidence that will stand in the courts to\\nconvict this fellow, and if he\\'s scared off before we get that,\\nthe game will be up.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what my photo telephone will do--it will get the evidence,\\njust as a dictaphone does. In fact, I\\'m thinking of working it out\\non those lines, after I clear up this business.\"\\n\\n\"Just suppose we had detectives stationed at all the telephones\\nnear the sawmill, where this fellow would be likely to go. In the\\nfirst place no one has seen him, as far as we know, so there\\'s no\\ntelling what sort of a chap he is. And you can\\'t go up to a\\nperfect stranger and arrest him because you think he is the man\\nwho has spirited away Mr. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"Another thing. Until this fellow has talked, and made his offer\\nto Mrs. Damon, to restore her husband, in exchange for certain\\npapers, we have no hold over him.\"\\n\\n\"But he has done that, Tom. You heard him, and you have his voice\\ndown on the wax cylinder.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but I haven\\'t had a glimpse of his face. That\\'s what I want,\\nand what I\\'m going to get. Suppose he does go into the telephone\\nbooth, and tell Mrs. Damon an address where she is to send the\\npapers. Even if a detective was near at hand he might not catch\\nwhat was said. Or, if he did, on what ground could he arrest a man\\nwho, very likely, would be a perfect stranger to him? The\\ndetective couldn\\'t say: \\'I take you into custody for telephoning\\nan address to Mrs. Damon.\\' That, in itself, is no crime.\"\\n\\n\"No, I suppose not,\" admitted Ned. \"You\\'ve got this all thought\\nout, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have. You see it takes quite a combination to get\\nevidence against a criminal--evidence that will convict him.\\nThat\\'s why I have to be so careful in setting my trap.\"\\n\\n\"I see, Tom. Well, it\\'s about time for us to get busy; isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\n\"It sure is. There\\'s lots to do. First we\\'ll go see the telephone\\npeople.\"\\n\\nTom explained to the \\'phone manager the necessity for what he was\\nabout to do. The manager at once agreed to let the young inventor\\nhave a free hand. He was much interested in the photo telephone,\\nand Tom promised to give his company a chance to use it on their\\nlines, later.\\n\\nThe telephone near the sawmill was easily located. It was in a\\ngeneral store, and the instrument was in a booth. To this\\ninstrument Tom attached his sending plate, and he also substituted\\nfor the ordinary incandescent light, a powerful tungsten one, that\\nwould give illumination enough to cause the likeness to be\\ntransmitted over the wire.\\n\\nThe same thing was done to a number of the public telephones in\\nthat vicinity, each one being fitted up so that the picture of\\nwhoever talked would be transmitted over the wire when Tom turned\\nthe switch. To help the plan further the telephone manager marked\\na number of other \\'phones, \"Out of Order,\" for the time being.\\n\\n\"Now, I think we\\'re done!\" exclaimed the young inventor, with a\\nsigh, late that night. He and Ned and the line manager had worked\\nhard.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered the young banker, \"the traps are set. The question\\nis: Will our rat be caught?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\nTHE PHOTO TELEPHONE\\n\\n\\nTom Swift was taking, as he afterward confessed, \"a mighty big\\nchance.\" But it seemed the only way. He was working against\\ncunning men, and had to be as cunning as they.\\n\\nTrue, the man he hoped to capture, through the combination of his\\nphoto telephone and the phonograph, might go to some other\\ninstrument than one of those Tom had adjusted. But this could not\\nbe helped. In all he had put his new attachment on eight \\'phones\\nin the vicinity of the sawmill. So he had eight chances in his\\nfavor, and as many against him as there were other telephones in\\nuse.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a mighty small margin in our favor,\" sighed Tom.\\n\\n\"It sure is,\" agreed Ned. They were at Mrs. Damon\\'s house,\\nwaiting for the call to come in.\\n\\n\"But we couldn\\'t do anything else,\" went on Tom.\\n\\n\"No,\" spoke Ned, \"and I have a great deal of hope in the\\nproverbial Swift luck, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I only hope it holds good this time!\" laughed the young\\ninventor.\\n\\n\"There are a good many things that can go wrong,\" observed Ned.\\n\"The least little slip-up may spoil your traps, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"I know it, Ned. But I\\'ve got to take the chance. We\\'ve just got\\nto do something for Mrs. Damon. She\\'s wearing herself out by\\nworrying,\" he added in a low voice, for indeed the wife of his\\nfriend felt the absence of her husband greatly. She had lost\\nflesh, she ate scarcely anything, and her nights were wakeful ones\\nof terror.\\n\\n\"What if this fails?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'m going to work that button clue to the limit,\" replied\\nTom. \"I\\'ll go to Boylan and see what he and Peters have to say.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'d done as I suggested you\\'d have gone to them first,\"\\nspoke Ned. \"You\\'ll find they\\'re mixed up in this.\"\\n\\n\"Maybe; but I doubt it. I tell you there isn\\'t a clue leading to\\nPeters--as yet.\"\\n\\n\"But there will be,\" insisted Ned. \"You\\'ll see that that I\\'m right\\nthis time.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see it, Ned. As a matter of fact, I would have gone to\\nBoylan about that button I found in my airship only I\\'ve been so\\nbusy on this photo telephone, and in arranging the trap, that I\\nhaven\\'t had time. But if this fails--and I\\'m hoping it won\\'t--I\\'ll\\nget after him,\" and there was a grim look on the young inventor\\'s\\nface.\\n\\nIt was wearying and nervous work--this waiting. Tom and Ned felt\\nthe strain as they sat there in Mrs. Damon\\'s library, near the\\ntelephone. It had been fitted up in readiness. Attached to the\\nreceiving wires was a sensitive plate, on which Tom hoped would be\\nimprinted the image of the man at the other end of the wire--the\\ncriminal who, in exchange for the valuable land papers, would give\\nMr. Damon his liberty.\\n\\nThere was also the phonograph cylinder to record the man\\'s voice.\\nSeveral times, while waiting for the call to come in, Tom got up\\nto test the apparatus. It was in perfect working order.\\n\\nAs before, there was an extension telephone, so that Mrs. Damon\\ncould talk to the unknown, while Tom could hear as well. But he\\nplanned to take no part in the conversation unless something\\nunforeseen occurred.\\n\\nMr. Damon was an enthusiastic photographer, and he had a dark room\\nadjoining his library. It was in this dark room that Tom planned\\nto develop the photo telephone plate.\\n\\nOn this occasion he was not going to use the metal plate in which,\\nordinarily, the image of the person talking appeared. That record\\nwas but a fleeting one, as in a mirror. This time Tom wanted a\\npermanent picture that could, if necessary, be used in a court of\\njustice.\\n\\nTom\\'s plan was this: If the person who had demanded the papers\\ncame to one of the photo telephones, and spoke to Mrs. Damon, Tom\\nwould switch on the receiving apparatus. Thus, while the man was\\ntalking, his picture would be taken, though he would not know of\\nthe thing being done.\\n\\nHis voice would also be recorded on the wax cylinder, and he would\\nbe equally unaware of this.\\n\\nWhen Tom had imprinted the fellow\\'s image on the prepared plate,\\nhe would go quickly to the dark room and develop it. A wet print\\ncould be made, and with this as evidence, and to use in\\nidentification, a quick trip could be made to the place whence the\\nman had telephoned. Tom hoped thus to capture him.\\n\\nTo this end he had his airship in waiting, and as soon as he had\\ndeveloped the picture he planned to rush off to the vicinity of\\nthe sawmill, and make a prisoner of the man whose features would\\nbe revealed to him over the wire.\\n\\nIt was a hazardous plan--a risky one--but it was the best that he\\ncould evolve. Tom had instructed Mrs. Damon to keep the man in\\nconversation as long as possible, in order to give the young\\ninventor himself time to rush off in his airship. But of course\\nthe man might get suspicious and leave. That was another chance\\nthat had to be taken.\\n\\n\"If I had thought of it in time,\" said Tom, musingly, as he paced\\nup and down in the library waiting for the \\'phone to ring, \"if I\\nhad thought of it in time I would have rigged up two plates--one\\nfor a temporary, or looking-glass, picture, and the other for a\\npermanent one. In that way I could rush off as soon as I got a\\nglimpse of the fellow. But it\\'s too late to do that now. I\\'ll have\\nto develop this plate.\"\\n\\nWaiting is the most wearisome work there is. Tom and Ned found\\nthis to be the case, as they sat there, hoping each moment that\\nthe telephone bell would ring, and that the man at the other end\\nof the wire would be the mysterious stranger. Mrs. Damon, too,\\nfelt the nervous strain.\\n\\n\"This is about the hour he called up yesterday,\" said Tom, in a\\nlow voice, after coming back from a trip to the window to see that\\nhis airship was in readiness. He had brought Koku over to help in\\nstarting it, for he was using his most powerful and speedy craft,\\nand the propellers were hard to turn.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Damon. \"It was just about this hour, Tom. Oh,\\nI do hope--\"\\n\\nShe was interrupted by the jingle of the telephone bell. With a\\njump Tom was at the auxiliary instrument, while Mrs. Damon lifted\\noff the receiver of her own telephone.\\n\\n\"Yes; what is it?\" she asked, in a voice that she tried to make\\ncalm.\\n\\n\"Do you know who this is?\" Tom heard come over the wire.\\n\\n\"Are you the--er--the person who was to give me an address where I\\nam to send certain papers?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I\\'m the same one. I\\'m glad to see that you have acted\\nsensibly. If I get the papers all right, you\\'ll soon have your\\nhusband back. Now do as I say. Take down this address.\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" assented Mrs. Damon. She looked over at Tom. He was\\nintently listening, and he, too, would note the address given. The\\ntrap was about to be sprung. The game had walked into it. Just\\nwhich telephone was being used Tom could not as yet tell. It was\\nevidently not the one nearest the planing mill, for Tom could not\\nhear the buzzing sound. It was well he had put his attachment on\\nseveral instruments.\\n\\n\"One moment, please,\" said Mrs. Damon, to the unknown at the other\\nend of the wire. This was in accordance with the pre-arranged\\nplan.\\n\\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked the man, impatiently. \"I have no time to\\nwaste.\"\\n\\nTom heard again the same gruff tones, and he tried in vain to\\nrecognize them.\\n\\n\"I want you take down a message to Mr. Damon,\" said his wife.\\n\"This is very important. It can do you no harm to give him this\\nmessage; but I want you to get it exact. If you do not promise to\\ndeliver it I shall call all negotiations off.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, all right I\\'ll take the message; but be quick about it. Then\\nI\\'ll give you the address where you are to send the papers.\"\\n\\n\"This is the message,\" went on Mrs. Damon. \"Please write it down.\\nIt is very important to me. Have you a pencil?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have one. Wait until I get a bit of paper. It\\'s so dark in\\nthis booth--wait until I turn on the light.\"\\n\\nTom could not repress a pleased and joyful exclamation. It was\\njust what he had hoped the man would do--turn on the light in the\\nbooth. Indeed, it was necessary for the success of the trap that\\nthe light be switched on. Otherwise no picture could be\\ntransmitted over the wire. And the plan of having the man write\\ndown a message to Mr. Damon was arranged with that end in view.\\nThe man would need a light to see to write, and Tom\\'s apparatus\\nmust be lighted in order to make it work. The plot was coming\\nalong finely.\\n\\n\"There!\" exclaimed the man at the other end of the wire. \"I have a\\nlight now. Go ahead with your message, Mrs. Damon. But make it\\nshort. I can\\'t stay here long.\"\\n\\nThen Mrs. Damon began dictating the message she and Tom had agreed\\nupon. It was as long as they dared make it, for they wanted to\\nkeep the man in the booth to the last second.\\n\\n\"Dear Husband,\" began Mrs. Damon. What the message was does not\\nmatter. It has nothing to do with this story. Sufficient to say\\nthat the moment the man began writing it down, as Tom could tell\\nover the sensitive wire, by the scratching of the pencil--at that\\nmoment Tom, knowing the light was on in the distant telephone\\nbooth, switched on the picture-taking apparatus. His receiving\\napparatus at once indicated that the image was being made on the\\nsensitive plate.\\n\\nIt took only a few seconds of time, and with the plate in the\\nholder Tom hastened to the dark room to develop it. Ned took his\\nchum\\'s place at the telephone, to see that all worked smoothly.\\nThe photo telephone had done it\\'s work. Whose image would be found\\nimprinted on the sensitive plate? Tom\\'s hands trembled so that he\\ncould scarcely put it in the developing solution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\nTHE ESCAPE\\n\\n\\nNed Newton, listening at the auxiliary telephone heard the man, to\\nwhom Mrs. Damon was dictating her message to her husband, utter an\\nexclamation of impatience.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I can\\'t take down any more,\" he called. \"That is\\nenough. Now you listen. I want you to send me those papers.\"\\n\\n\"And I am willing to,\" went on Mrs. Damon, while Ned listened to\\nthe talk, the phonograph faithfully recording it.\\n\\n\"I wonder whose picture Tom will find,\" mused Ned.\\n\\nThe unknown, at the other end of the wire, began giving Mrs. Damon\\na description of just what papers he wanted, and how to mail them\\nto him. He gave an address that Ned recognized as that of a cigar\\nstore, where many persons received their mail under assumed names.\\nThe postal authorities had, for a long time, tried to get evidence\\nagainst it.\\n\\n\"That\\'s going to make it hard to get him, when he comes for the\\npapers,\" thought Ned. \"He\\'s a foxy criminal, all right. But I\\nguess Tom will turn the trick.\"\\n\\nMrs. Damon was carefully noting down the address. She really\\nintended to send the papers, if it proved that there was no other\\nway in which she could secure the release of her husband. But she\\ndid not count on all of Tom\\'s plans. \"Why doesn\\'t he develop that\\nplate?\" thought Ned. \"He\\'ll be too late, in spite of his airship.\\nThat fellow will skip.\"\\n\\nIt was at that moment that Tom came into the library. He moved\\ncautiously, for he realized that a loud sound in the room would\\ncarry to the man at the other end of the wire. Tom motioned for\\nNed to come to him. He held out a dripping photographic plate.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Peters!\" said Tom, in a hoarse whisper.\\n\\n\"Peters?\" gasped Ned. \"How could it be? His voice--\"\\n\\n\"I know. It didn\\'t sound a bit like Peters over the \\'phone, but\\nthere\\'s his picture, all right!\"\\n\\nTom held up the plate. There, imprinted on it by the wonderful\\npower of the young inventor\\'s latest appliance, was the image of\\nthe rascally promoter. As plainly as in life he was shown, even to\\nhis silk hat and the flower in his button-hole. He was in a\\ntelephone booth--that much could be told from the photograph that\\nhad been transmitted over the wire, but which booth could not be\\nsaid--they were nearly all alike.\\n\\n\"Peters!\" gasped Ned. \"I thought he was the fellow, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know. You were right, and I was wrong. But I did not\\nrecognize his voice. It was very hoarse. He must have a bad cold.\"\\nLater this was learned to have been the case. \"There\\'s no time to\\nlose,\" whispered Tom, while Mrs. Damon was doing her best to\\nprolong the conversation in order to hold the man at the other end\\nof the wire. \"Ned, get central on the other telephone, and see\\nwhere this call came from. Then we\\'ll get there as fast as the\\nairship will take us.\"\\n\\nA second and temporary telephone line had been installed in the\\nDamon home, and on this Ned was soon talking, while Tom, putting\\nthe photographic plate away for future use, rushed out to get his\\nairship in shape for a quick flight. He had modified his plans.\\nInstead of having a detective take a print of the photo telephone\\nimage, and make the arrest, Tom was going to try to capture Peters\\nhimself. He believed he could do it. One look at the wet plate was\\nenough. He knew Peters, though it upset some of his theories to\\nlearn that it was the promoter who was responsible for Mr. Damon\\'s\\ndisappearance.\\n\\nThe man at the other end of the wire was evidently getting\\nimpatient. Possibly he suspected some trick. \"I\\'ve got to go now,\"\\nhe called to Mrs. Damon. \"If I don\\'t get those papers in the\\nmorning it will be the worse for Mr. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll send you the papers,\" she said.\\n\\nBy this time Ned had gotten into communication with the manager of\\nthe central telephone exchange, and had learned the location of\\nthe instrument Peters was using. It was about a mile from the one\\nnear the sawmill.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" called Tom to his chum, as the latter gave him this\\ninformation. \"The Firefly is tuned up for a hundred miles an hour!\\nWe\\'ll be there in ten minutes! We must catch him red-handed, if\\npossible!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s gone!\" gasped Mrs. Damon as she came to the outer door, and\\nwatched Tom and Ned taking their places in the airship, while Koku\\nprepared to twirl the propellers.\\n\\n\"Gone!\" echoed Tom, blankly.\\n\\n\"Yes, he hung up the receiver.\"\\n\\n\"See if you can\\'t get him back,\" suggested the young inventor.\\n\"Ask Central to ring that number again. We\\'ll be there in a jiffy.\\nMaybe he\\'ll come to the telephone again. Or he may even call up\\nhis partners and tell them the game is working his way. Try to get\\nhim back, Mrs. Damon.\"\\n\\n\"I will,\" she said.\\n\\nAnd, as she hurried back to the instrument, Tom and Ned shot up\\ntoward the blue sky in an endeavor to capture the man at the other\\ntelephone.\\n\\n\"And to think it was Peters!\" cried Tom into Ned\\'s ear, shouting\\nto be heard above the roar of the motor exhaust.\\n\\n\"I thought he\\'d turn out to be mixed up in the affair,\" said Ned.\\n\\n\"Well, you were right. I was off, that time,\" admitted Tom, as he\\nguided his powerful craft above the trees. \"I was willing to admit\\nthat he had something to do with Mr. Damon\\'s financial trouble,\\nbut as for kidnapping him--well, you never can tell.\"\\n\\nThey drove on at a breath-catching pace, and it seemed hardly a\\nminute after leaving Mrs. Damon\\'s house before Tom called:\\n\\n\"There\\'s the building where the telephone is located.\"\\n\\n\"And now for that rascal Peters!\" cried Ned.\\n\\nThe airship swooped down, to the great astonishment of some\\nworkmen nearby.\\n\\nHardly had the wheels ceased revolving on the ground, as Tom made\\na quick landing, than he was out of his seat, and running toward\\nthe telephone. He knew the place at once from having heard Ned\\'s\\ndescription, and besides, this was one of the places where he had\\ninstalled his apparatus.\\n\\nInto the store Tom burst, and made a rush for the \\'phone booth. He\\nthrew open the door. The place was empty!\\n\\n\"The man--the man who was telephoning!\" Tom called to the\\nproprietor of the place.\\n\\n\"You mean that big man, with the tall hat, who was in there so\\nlong?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, where is he?\"\\n\\n\"Gone. About two minutes ago.\"\\n\\n\"Which way?\"\\n\\n\"Over toward Shopton, and in one of the fastest autos that ever\\nscattered dust in this section.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s escaped us!\" said Tom to Ned. \"But we\\'ll get him yet! Come\\non!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m with you. Say, do you know what this looks like to me?\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"It looks as if Peters was scared and was going to run away to\\nstay!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\nON THE TRAIL\\n\\n\\nSuch a crowd had quickly gathered about Tom\\'s airship that it was\\nimpossible to start it. Men and boys, and even some girls and\\nwomen, coming from no one knew where, stood about the machine,\\nmaking wondering remarks about it.\\n\\n\"Stand back, if you please!\" cried Tom, good-naturedly. \"We\\'ve\\ngot to get after the fellow in the auto.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have hard work catching him, friend, in that rig,\"\\nremarked a man. \"He was fracturing all the speed laws ever passed.\\nI reckon he was going nigh onto sixty miles an hour.\"\\n\\n\"We can make a hundred,\" spoke Ned, quietly.\\n\\n\"A hundred! Get out!\" cried the man. \"Nothing can go as fast as\\nthat!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll show you, if we once get started,\" said Tom. \"I guess we\\'ll\\nhave to get one of these fellows to twirl the propellers for us,\\nNed,\" he added. \"I didn\\'t think, or I\\'d have brought the self-starting\\nmachine,\" for this one of Tom\\'s had to be started by someone\\nturning over the propellers, once or twice, to enable the motor\\nto begin to speed. On some of his aircraft the young inventor had\\nattached a starter, something like the ones on the newest autos.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Ned, as Tom looked to the\\npriming of the cylinders.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to get on the trail of Peters,\" he said. \"He\\'s at the\\nbottom of the whole business; and it\\'s a surprise to me. I\\'m going\\nto trail him right down to the ground now, and make him give up\\nMr. Damon and his fortune.\"\\n\\n\"But you don\\'t know where he is, Tom.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll find out. He isn\\'t such an easy man to miss--he\\'s too\\nconspicuous. Besides, if he\\'s just left in his auto we may catch\\nhim before he gets to Shopton.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he\\'s going there?\"\\n\\n\"I think so. And I think, Ned, that he\\'s become suspicious and\\nwill light out. Something must have happened, while he was\\ntelephoning, and he got frightened, as big a bluff as he is. But\\nwe\\'ll get him. Come on! Will you turn over the propellers, please?\\nI\\'ll show you how to do it,\" Tom went on to a big, strong man\\nstanding close to the blades.\\n\\n\"Sure I\\'ll do it,\" was the answer. \"I was a helper once at an\\nairship meet, and I know how.\"\\n\\n\"Get back out of the way in time,\" the young inventor warned him.\\n\"They start very suddenly, sometimes.\"\\n\\n\"All right, friend, I\\'ll watch out,\" was the reply, and with Tom\\nand Ned in their seats, the former at the steering wheel, the\\ncraft of the air was soon throbbing and trembling under the first\\nturn, for the cylinders were still warm from the run from Mrs.\\nDamon\\'s house.\\n\\nThe telephone was in an outlying section of Waterford--a section\\ndevoted in the main to shops and factories, and the homes of those\\nemployed in various lines of manufacture. Peters had chosen his\\nplace well, for there were many roads leading to and from this\\nsection, and he could easily make his escape.\\n\\n\"But we\\'ll get after him,\" thought Tom, grimly, as he let the\\nairship run down the straight road a short distance on the bicycle\\nwheels, to give it momentum enough so that it would rise.\\n\\nThen, with the tilting of the elevation rudder, the craft rose\\ngracefully, amid admiring cheers from the crowd. Tom did not go up\\nvery far, as he wanted to hover near the ground, to pick out the\\nspeeding auto containing Peters.\\n\\nBut this time luck was not with Tom. He and Ned did sight a number\\nof cars speeding along the highway toward Shopton, but when they\\ngot near enough to observe the occupants they were disappointed\\nnot to behold the man they sought. Tom circled about for some\\ntime, but it was of no use, and then he headed his craft back\\ntoward Waterford.\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Ned, yelling the words into the ear\\nof his chum.\\n\\n\"Back to Mrs. Damon\\'s,\" answered Tom, in equally loud tones.\\n\\nIt was impossible to talk above the roaring and throbbing of the\\nmotor, so the two lads kept silent until the airship had landed\\nnear Mrs. Damon\\'s home.\\n\\n\"I want to see if Mrs. Damon is all right,\" Tom explained, as he\\njumped from the still moving machine. \"Then we\\'ll go to Shopton,\\nand cause Peters\\'s arrest. I can make a charge against him now,\\nand the evidence of the photo telephone will convict him, I\\'m\\nsure. And I also want to see if Mrs. Damon has had any other\\nword.\"\\n\\nShe had not, however, though she was more nervous and worried than\\never.\\n\\n\"Oh, Tom, what shall I do?\" she exclaimed. \"I am so frightened!\\nWhat do you suppose they will do to Mr. Damon?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all!\" Tom assured her. \"He will be all right. I think\\nmatters are coming to a crisis now, and very likely he\\'ll be with\\nyou inside of twenty-four hours. The game is up, and I guess\\nPeters knows it. I\\'m going to have him arrested at once.\"\\n\\n\"Shall I send those land papers, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed you must not! But I\\'ll talk to you about that later. Just\\nput away that phonograph record of Peters\\'s talk. I\\'ll take along\\nthe photo telephone negative, and have some prints made--or, I\\nguess, since we\\'re going in the airship, that I\\'d better leave it\\nhere for the present. We\\'ll use it as evidence against Peters.\\nCome on, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"Where to now?\"\\n\\n\"Peters\\'s house. He\\'s probably there, arranging to cover up his\\ntracks when he lights out.\"\\n\\nBut Shallock Peters did better than merely cover up his tracks. He\\ncovered himself up, so to speak. For when Ned and Tom, after a\\nquick flight in the airship, reached his house, the promoter had\\nleft, and the servants, who were quite excited, did not know where\\nhe had gone.\\n\\n\"He just packed up a few clothes and ran out,\" said one of the\\nmaids. \"He didn\\'t say anything about our wages, either, and he\\nowes me over a month.\"\\n\\n\"Me too,\" said another.\\n\\n\"Well, if he doesn\\'t pay me some of my back wages soon, I\\'ll sue\\nhim!\" declared the gardener. \"He owes me more than three months,\\nbut he kept putting me off.\"\\n\\nAnd, so it seemed, Peters had done with several of his employes.\\nWhen the promoter came to Shopton he had taken an elaborate house\\nand engaged a staff of servants. Peters was not married, but he\\ngave a number of entertainments to which the wealthy men of\\nShopton and their wives came. Later it was found that the bills\\nfor these had never been paid. In short, Peters was a \"bluff\" in\\nmore ways than one.\\n\\nTom told enough of his story to the servants to get them on his\\nside. Indeed, now that their employer had gone, and under such\\nqueer circumstances, they had no sympathy for him. They were only\\nconcerned about their own money, and Tom was given admittance to\\nthe house.\\n\\nTom made a casual search, hoping to find some clue to the\\nwhereabouts of Mr. Damon, or to get some papers that would save\\nhis fortune. But the search was unsuccessful.\\n\\nThere was a safe in the room Peters used for an office, but when\\nTom got there the strong box was open, and only some worthless\\ndocuments remained.\\n\\n\"He smelled a rat, all right,\" said Tom, grimly. \"After he\\ntelephoned to Mrs. Damon something happened that gave him an\\nintimation that someone was after him. So he got away as soon as\\nhe could.\"\\n\\n\"But what are you going to do about it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Get right after him. He can\\'t have gotten very far. I want him\\nand I want Boylan. We\\'re getting close to the end of the trail,\\nNed.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but we haven\\'t found Mr. Damon yet, and his fortune seems to\\nhave vanished.\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll do the best we can,\" said Tom, grimly. \"Now I\\'m going\\nto get a warrant for the arrest of Peters, and one for Boylan, and\\nI\\'m going to get myself appointed a special officer with power to\\nserve them. We\\'ve got our work cut out for us, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m with you to the end.\"\\n\\n\"I know you are!\" cried Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\nTHE LONELY HOUSE\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor had little difficulty in getting the warrants\\nhe sought. In the case of Boylan, who seemed to be Peters\\'s\\nright-hand man, when it came to criminal work, Tom made a charge of\\nunlawfully taking the airship. This would be enough to hold the\\nman on until other evidence could be obtained against him.\\n\\nAs for Peters, he was accused of taking certain valuable bonds and\\nstocks belonging to Mr. Damon. Mrs. Damon gave the necessary\\nevidence in this case, and the authorities were told that later,\\nwhen Peters should have been arrested, other evidence so\\nskillfully gotten by Tom\\'s photo telephone, would be brought\\nbefore the court.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a new way of convicting a man--by a photo telephone--but I\\nguess it\\'s a good one,\" said the judge who signed the warrants.\\n\\n\"Well, now that we\\'ve got what we want, the next thing to do is to\\nget the men--Peters, and the others,\" said Tom, as he and Ned sat\\nin Tom\\'s library after several hours of strenuous work.\\n\\n\"How are you going to start?\" the young banker wanted to know. \"It\\nseems a strange thing that a man like Mr. Damon could be made away\\nwith, and kept in hiding so long without something being heard of\\nhim. I\\'m afraid, Tom, that something must have happened to him.\"\\n\\n\"I think so too, Ned. Nothing serious, though,\" Tom added,\\nquickly, as he saw the look of alarm on his chum\\'s face. \"I think\\nMr. Damon at first went away of his own accord.\"\\n\\n\"Of his own accord?\"\\n\\n\"Yes. I think Peters induced him to go with him, on the pretense\\nthat he could recover his fortune. After getting Mr. Damon in\\ntheir power they kept him, probably to get the rest of his fortune\\naway from him.\"\\n\\n\"But you stopped that, Tom,\" said Ned, proud of his chum\\'s\\nabilities.\\n\\n\"Well, I hope so,\" admitted the young inventor. \"But I\\'ve still\\ngot plenty to do.\"\\n\\n\"Have you a starting point?\"\\n\\n\"For one thing,\" Tom answered, \"I\\'m going to have Mrs. Damon mail\\na fake package to the address Peters gave. If he, or any of his\\nmen, call for it, we\\'ll have a detective on the watch, and arrest\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\"Good!\"\\n\\n\"Of course it may not work,\" spoke Tom; \"but it\\'s something to\\ntry, and we can\\'t miss any chances.\"\\n\\nAccordingly, the next day, a package containing only blank paper,\\nmade up to represent the documents demanded by Peters as the price\\nof releasing Mr. Damon, was mailed to the address Mrs. Damon had\\nreceived over the wire from the rascally promoter. Then a private\\ndetective was engaged to be on the watch, to take into custody\\nwhoever called for the bundle. Tom, though, had not much hope of\\nanything coming of this, as it was evident that Peters had taken\\nthe alarm, and left.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said Tom, when he had safely put away the wax record,\\ncontaining the incriminating talk of Peters, and had printed\\nseveral photographs, so wonderfully taken over the wire, \"now to\\nget on the trail again.\"\\n\\nIt was not an easy one to follow. Tom began at the deserted home\\nof the alleged financier. The establishment was broken up, for\\nmany tradesmen came with bills that had not been paid, and some of\\nthem levied on what little personal property there was to satisfy\\ntheir claims. The servants left, sorrowful enough over their\\nmissing wages. The place was closed up under the sheriff\\'s orders.\\n\\nBut of Peters and his men not a trace could be found. Tom and Ned\\ntraveled all over the surrounding country, looking for clues, but\\nin vain. They made several trips in the airship, but finally\\ndecided that an automobile was more practical for their work, and\\nkept to that.\\n\\nThey did find some traces of Peters. As Tom had said, the man was\\ntoo prominent not to be noticed. He might have disguised himself,\\nthough it seemed that the promoter was a proud man, and liked to\\nbe seen in flashy clothes, a silk hat, and with a buttonhole\\nbouquet.\\n\\nThis made it easy to get the first trace of him. He had been seen\\nto take a train at the Shopton station, though he had not bought a\\nticket. The promoter had paid his fare to Branchford, a junction\\npoint, but there all trace of him was lost. It was not even\\ncertain that he went there.\\n\\n\"He may have done that to throw us off,\" said Tom. \"Just because\\nhe paid his way to Branchford, doesn\\'t say he went there. He may\\nhave gotten off at the next station beyond Shopton.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he\\'s still lingering around here?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t be surprised,\" was Tom\\'s answer. \"He knows that there\\nis still some of the Damon property left, and he is probably\\nhungry for that. We\\'ll get him yet, Ned.\"\\n\\nBut at the end of several days Tom\\'s hopes did not seem in a fair\\nway to be realized. He and Ned followed one useless clue after\\nanother. All the trails seemed blind ones. But Tom never gave up.\\n\\nHe was devoting all his time now to the finding of his friend Mr.\\nDamon, and to the recovery of his fortune. In fact the latter was\\nnot so important to Tom as was the former. For Mrs. Damon was on\\nthe verge of a nervous collapse on account of the absence of her\\nhusband.\\n\\n\"If I could only have some word from him, Tom!\" she cried,\\nhelplessly.\\n\\nTo Tom the matter was very puzzling. It seemed utterly impossible\\nthat Mr. Damon could be kept so close a prisoner that he could not\\nmanage to get some word to his friends. It was not as if he was a\\nchild. He was a man of more than ordinary abilities. Surely he\\nmight find a way to outwit his enemies.\\n\\nBut the days passed, and no word came. A number of detectives had\\nbeen employed, but they were no more successful than Tom. The\\nlatter had given up his inventive work, for the time being, to\\ndevote all his time to the solution of the mystery.\\n\\nTom and Ned had been away from Shopton for three days, following\\nthe most promising clue they had yet received. But it had failed\\nat the end, and one afternoon they found themselves in a small\\ntown, about a hundred miles from Shopton. They had been motoring.\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll call up the house,\" said Tom. \"Dad may have received\\nsome news, or Mrs. Damon may have sent him some word. I\\'ll get my\\nfather on the wire.\"\\n\\nConnection to Tom\\'s house was soon made, and Ned, who was\\nlistening to his chum\\'s remarks, was startled to hear him cry out:\\n\\n\"What\\'s that you say? My airship taken again? When did it happen?\\nYes, I\\'m listening. Go on, Father!\"\\n\\nThen followed a silence while Tom listened, breaking in now and\\nthen with an excited remark, Suddenly he called:\\n\\n\"Good-by, Dad! I\\'m coming right home!\"\\n\\nTom hung up the receiver with a bang, and turned to his chum.\\n\\n\"What do you think!\" he cried. \"The Eagle was taken again last\\nnight! The same way as before. Nobody got a glimpse of the\\nthieves, though. Dad has been trying to get in communication with\\nme ever since. I\\'m glad I called up. Now we\\'ll get right back to\\nShopton, and see what we can do. This is the limit! Peters and his\\ncrowd will be kidnapping us, next.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" agreed Ned.\\n\\nHe and Tom were soon off again, speeding in the auto toward\\nShopton. But the roads were bad, after a heavy rain, and they did\\nnot make fast time.\\n\\nThe coming of dusk found them with more than thirty miles to go.\\nThey were in an almost deserted section of the country when\\nsuddenly, as they were running slowly up a hill, there was a\\nsudden crack, the auto gave a lurch to one side of the roadway and\\nthen settled heavily. Tom clapped on both brakes quickly, and gave\\na cry of dismay.\\n\\n\"Broken front axle!\" he said. \"We\\'re dished, Ned!\"\\n\\nThey got out, being no more harmed than by the jolting. The car\\nwas out of commission. The two chums looked around. Except for a\\nlonely house, that bore every mark of being deserted, not a\\ndwelling was in sight where they might ask for aid or shelter.\\n\\nAnd, as they looked, from that lonely house came a strange cry--a\\ncry as though for help!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nTHE AIRSHIP CAPTURE\\n\\n\\n\"Did you hear that?\" cried Ned.\\n\\n\"I certainly did,\" answered Tom. \"What was it.\"\\n\\n\"Sounded to me like a cry of some sort.\"\\n\\n\"It was. An animal, I\\'d say.\"\\n\\nThe two chums moved away from the broken auto, and looked at each\\nother. Then, by a common impulse, they started toward the lonely\\nhouse, which was set back some distance from the road.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s see who it was,\" suggested Tom, \"After all, though it looks\\ndeserted, there may be someone in the house, and we\\'ve got to have\\nsome kind of help. I don\\'t want to leave my car on the road all\\nnight, though it will have to be repaired before I can use it\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"It sure is a bad break,\" agreed Ned.\\n\\nAs they walked toward the deserted House they heard the strange\\ncry again. It was louder this time, and following it the boys\\nheard a sound as if a blow had been struck.\\n\\n\"Someone is being attacked!\" cried Tom. \"Maybe some poor tramp has\\ntaken shelter in there and a dog is after them. Come on, Ned,\\nwe\\'ve got to help!\"\\n\\nThey started on a run for the lonely house, but while still some\\ndistance away a curious thing happened.\\n\\nThere was a sudden cry--an appeal for help it seemed--but this\\ntime in the open. And, as Tom and Ned looked, they saw several men\\nrunning from the rear of the old house. Between them they carried\\nan inert form.\\n\\n\"Something\\'s wrong!\" exclaimed Tom, \"There\\'s crooked work going on\\nhere, Ned.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right! It\\'s up to us to stop it! Come on!\"\\n\\nBut before the boys had taken half a dozen more steps they heard\\nthat which caused them great surprise. For from a shed behind the\\nhouse came the unmistakable throb and roar of a motor.\\n\\n\"They\\'re going off in an auto!\" cried Ned.\\n\\n\"And they\\'re carrying someone with them!\" exclaimed Tom.\\n\\nBy this time they had gotten to a point where they could see the\\nshed, and what was their astonishment to see being rolled from it\\na big biplane. At the sight of it Tom cried:\\n\\n\"It\\'s the Eagle! That\\'s my airship, Ned!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re right! How did it get here?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s for us to find out. I shouldn\\'t wonder, Ned, but what\\nwe\\'re at last on the trail of Peters and his crowd!\"\\n\\nThe men--there were four or five of them, Ned guessed--now broke\\ninto a run, still carrying among them the inert form of another.\\nThe cries for help had ceased, and it seemed as if the unfortunate\\none was unconscious.\\n\\nA moment later, and before the boys could do anything, had they\\nthe power, the men fairly jumped aboard Tom Swift\\'s biggest\\nairship. The unconscious one was carried with them.\\n\\nThen the motor was speeded up. The roar and throbbing were almost\\ndeafening.\\n\\n\"Stop that! Hold on! That\\'s my machine!\" yelled Tom.\\n\\nHe might as well have spoken to the wind. With a rush and a roar\\nthe big Eagle shot away and upward, carrying the men and their\\nmysterious, unconscious companion. It was getting too dark for Tom\\nand Ned to make out the forms or features of the strangers.\\n\\n\"We\\'re too late!\" said Ned, hopelessly.\\n\\n\"Yes, they got away,\" agreed Tom. \"Oh, if only I had my speedy\\nlittle monoplane!\"\\n\\n\"But who can they be? How did your airship get here? And who is\\nthat man they carried out of the house?\" cried Ned.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know the last--maybe one of their crowd who was injured\\nin a fight.\"\\n\\n\"What crowd?\"\\n\\n\"The Peters gang, of course. Can\\'t you see it, Ned?\"\\n\\nUnable to do anything, the two youths watched the flight of the\\nEagle. She did not move at her usual speed, for she was carrying\\ntoo heavy a load.\\n\\nPresently from the air overhead, and slightly behind them, the\\nboys heard the sound of another motor. They turned quickly.\\n\\n\"Look!\" cried Ned. \"Another airship, by all that\\'s wonderful!\"\\n\\n\"If we could only stop them!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That\\'s a big\\nmachine, and they could take us aboard. Then we could chase the\\nEagle. We could catch her, too, for she\\'s overloaded!\"\\n\\nFrantically he and Tom waved their caps at the man who was now\\nalmost overhead in his airship. The boys did not call. They well\\nknew, with the noise of the motor, the occupant of the airship\\ncould not hear them. But they waved and pointed to the slowly-moving\\nEagle.\\n\\nTo their surprise and delight the man above them shut off his\\nengine, and seemed about to come down. Then Tom cried, knowing he\\ncould be heard:\\n\\n\"Help us capture that airship? It\\'s mine and they\\'ve stolen it!\"\\n\\n\"All right! Be with you in a minute!\" came back the answer from\\nabove.\\n\\nThe second biplane came down to earth, and as it ceased running\\nalong on its bicycle wheels, the occupant jumped out.\\n\\n\"Hello, Tom Swift!\" he called, as he took off his goggles.\\n\\n\"Why--why it\\'s Mr. Halling!\" cried the young inventor, in delight,\\nrecognizing the birdman who had brought him the first news of Mr.\\nDamon\\'s trouble, the day the airship became entangled in the\\naerials of the wireless on Tom\\'s house.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here, Tom?\" asked Mr. Hailing. \"What has\\nhappened?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re looking for Mr. Damon. That\\'s a bad crowd there,\" and he\\npointed toward the other aircraft. \"They have my Eagle. Can you\\nhelp me catch them?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly can--and will! Get aboard! I can carry four.\"\\n\\n\"Then you have a new machine?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, and a dandy! All the latest improvements--self-starter and\\nall! I\\'m glad of a chance to show it to you.\"\\n\\n\"And I\\'m glad, too!\" cried Tom. \"It was providential that you\\nhappened along. What were you doing here?\"\\n\\n\"Just out on a trial spin. But come on, if we\\'re going to catch\\nthose fellows!\"\\n\\nQuickly Tom, Ned, and Mr. Halling climbed into the seats of the\\nnew airship. It was started from a switch, and in a few seconds it\\nwas on the wing, chasing after the Eagle.\\n\\nThen began a strange race, a race in the air after the unknown\\nstrangers who had Tom\\'s machine. Had the Eagle not been so heavily\\nladen it might have escaped, for Tom\\'s craft was a speedy one. But\\nthis time it had to give the palm to Mr. Grant Halling\\'s. Faster\\nand faster in pursuit flew the Star, as the new craft was called.\\nFaster and faster, until at last, coming directly over the Eagle,\\nMr. Halling sent his craft down in such a manner as to \"blanket\"\\nthe other. In an instant she began to sink, and with cries of\\nalarm the men shut off the motor and started to volplane to the\\nearth.\\n\\nBut they made an unskillful landing. The Eagle tilted to one side,\\nand came down with a crash. There were cries of pain, then\\nsilence, and a few seconds later two men ran away from the\\ndisabled airship. But there were three senseless forms on the\\nground beside the craft when Tom, Ned and Mr. Halling ran up. In\\nthe fading light Tom saw a face he knew--three faces in fact.\\n\\n\"Mr. Damon!\" he cried. \"We\\'ve found him, Ned!\"\\n\\n\"But--too late--maybe!\" answered Ned, in a low voice, as he, too,\\nrecognized the man who had been missing so long.\\n\\nMr. Halling was bending over the unconscious form of his friend.\\n\\n\"He\\'s alive!\" he cried, joyfully. \"And not much hurt, either. But\\nhe has been ill, and looks half starved. Who are these men?\"\\n\\nTom gave a hasty look.\\n\\n\"Shallock Peters and Harrison Boylan!\" he cried. \"Ned, at last\\nwe\\'ve caught the scoundrels!\"\\n\\nIt was true. Chance had played into the hands of Tom Swift. While\\nMr. Halling was looking after Mr. Damon, reviving him, the young\\ninventor and Ned quickly bound the hands and feet of the two\\nplotters with pieces of wire from the broken airship.\\n\\nPresently Mr. Damon opened his eyes.\\n\\n\"Where am I? What happened? Oh, bless my watch chain--it\\'s Tom\\nSwift! Bless my cigar case, I--\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s all right!\" cried Tom, joyfully. \"When Mr. Damon blesses\\nsomething beside his tombstone he\\'s all right.\"\\n\\nPeters and Boylan soon revived, both being merely stunned, as was\\nMr. Damon. They looked about in wonder, and then, feeling that\\nthey were prisoners, resigned themselves to their fate. Both men\\nwere shabbily dressed, and Tom would hardly have known the once\\nspick and span Mr. Peters. He had no rose in his buttonhole now.\\n\\n\"Well, you have me, I see,\" he said, coolly. \"I was afraid we were\\nplaying for too high a stake.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'ve got you,\" replied Tom,\\n\\n\"But you can\\'t prove much against me,\" went on Peters. \"I\\'ll deny\\neverything.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see about that,\" added the young inventor, grimly, and\\nthought of the picture in the plate and the record on the wax\\ncylinder.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to get Mr. Damon to some place where he can be looked\\nafter,\" broke in Mr. Halling. \"Then we\\'ll hear the story.\"\\n\\nA passing farmer was prevailed on to take the party in his big\\nwagon to the nearest town, Mr. Hailing going on ahead in his\\nairship. Tom\\'s craft could not be moved, being badly damaged.\\n\\nOnce in town Peters and Boylan were put in jail, on the charges\\nfor which Tom carried warrants. Mr. Damon was taken to a hotel and\\na doctor summoned. It was as Mr. Halling had guessed. His friend\\nhad been ill, and so weak that he could not get out of bed. It was\\nthis that enabled the plotters to so easily keep him a prisoner.\\n\\nBy degrees Mr. Damon told his story. He had rashly allowed Peters\\nto get control of most of his fortune, and, in a vain hope of\\ngetting back some of his losses, had, one night--the night he\\ndisappeared, in fact--agreed to meet Peters and some of his men to\\ntalk matters over. Of this Mr. Damon said nothing to his wife.\\n\\nHe went out that night to meet Peters in the garden, but the\\nplotters had changed their plans. They boldly kidnapped their\\nvictim, chloroformed him and took him away in Tom\\'s airship, which\\nBoylan and some of his tools daringly stole a short time\\npreviously. Later they returned it, as they had no use for it at\\nthe lonely house.\\n\\nMr. Damon was taken to the house, and there kept a prisoner. The\\nmen hoped to prevail on the fears of his wife to make her give up\\nthe valuable property. But we have seen how Tom foiled Peters.\\n\\nThe experience of Mr. Damon, coupled with rough treatment he\\nreceived, and lack of good food, soon made him ill. He was so weak\\nthat he could not help himself, and with that he was kept under\\nguard. So he had no chance to escape or send his wife or friends\\nany word.\\n\\n\"But I\\'m all right now, Tom, thanks to you!\" said he. \"Bless my\\npocketbook, I don\\'t care if my fortune is lost, as long as I\\'m\\nalive and can get back to my wife.\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t believe your fortune will be lost,\" said Tom. \"I\\nthink I have the picture and other evidence that will save it,\"\\nand he told of his photo telephone, and of what it had accomplished.\\n\\n\"Bless my eyelashes!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What a young man you are,\\nTom Swift!\"\\n\\nTom smiled gladly. He knew now that his old friend was himself\\nonce more.\\n\\nThere is little left to tell. Chance had aided Tom in a most\\nwonderful way--chance and the presence of Mr. Halling with his\\nairship at just the right moment.\\n\\nTom made a diligent effort to find out who it was that had\\nchloroformed him in the telephone booth that time, but learned\\nnothing definite. Peters and Boylan were both examined as to this\\non their trials, but denied it, and the young inventor was forced\\nto conclude that it must have been some of the unscrupulous men\\nwho had taken his father\\'s patent some time before.\\n\\n\"They may have heard of your prosperity, and thought it a good\\nchance to rob you,\" suggested Ned.\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Tom. \"Well, we\\'ll let it go at that. Only I hope\\nthey don\\'t come again.\"\\n\\nMr. Damon was soon home with his wife again, and Peters and Boylan\\nwere held in heavy bail. They had secreted most of Mr. Damon\\'s\\nwealth, falsely telling him it was lost, and they were forced to\\ngive back his fortune. The evidence against them was clear and\\nconclusive. When Tom went into court with his phonograph record of\\nthe talk of Peters, even though the man\\'s voice was hoarse from a\\ncold when he talked, and when his picture was shown, in the\\ntelephone booth, the jury at once convicted him.\\n\\nBoylan, when he learned of the missing button in Tom\\'s possession,\\nconfessed that he and some of his men who were birdmen had taken\\nTom\\'s airship. They wanted a means of getting Mr. Damon to the\\nlonely house without being traced, and they accomplished it.\\n\\nAs Tom had surmised, Peters had become suspicious after his last\\ntalk with Mrs. Damon, and had fled. He disguised himself and went\\ninto hiding with the others at the lonely house. Then he learned\\nthat the authorities of another city, where he had swindled many,\\nwere on his trail, and he decided to decamp with his gang, taking\\nMr. Damon with them. For this purpose Tom\\'s airship was taken the\\nsecond time, and a wholesale escape, with Mr. Damon a prisoner,\\nwas planned.\\n\\nBut fate was against the plotters. Two of them did manage to get\\naway, but they were not really wanted. The big fish were Peters\\nand Boylan, and they were securely caught in the net of the law.\\nPeters was greatly surprised when he learned of Tom\\'s trap, and of\\nthe photo telephone. He had no idea he had been incriminating\\nhimself when he talked over the wire.\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s all over,\" remarked Ned to Tom, one day, when the\\ndisabled auto and the airship had been brought home and repaired.\\n\"The plotters are in prison for long terms, and Mr. Damon is\\nfound, together with his fortune. The photo telephone did it,\\nTom.\"\\n\\n\"Not all of it--but a good bit,\" admitted the young inventor, with\\na smile.\\n\\n\"What are you going to do next, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know. I think--\"\\n\\nBefore Tom could finish, a voice was heard in the hall outside the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n\"Bless my overshoes! Where\\'s Tom? I want to thank him again for\\nwhat he did for me,\" and Mr. Damon, now fully recovered, came in.\\n\"Bless my suspender button, but it\\'s good to be alive, Tom!\" he\\ncried.\\n\\n\"It certainly is,\" agreed Tom. \"And the next time you go for a\\nconference with such men as Peters, look out for airships.\"\\n\\n\"I will, Tom, I will!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my watch chain,\\nI will!\"\\n\\nAnd now, for a time, we will say good-bye to Tom Swift, leaving\\nhim to perfect his other inventions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tom Swift and his Photo Telephone, by\\nVictor Appleton\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SWIFT AND HIS PHOTO TELEPHONE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 4532.txt or 4532.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/5/3/4532/\\n\\nProduced by Robert Rowe, Charles Franks and the Online\\nDistributed Proofreading Team\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\n\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n',\n",

BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT)\\n</b>Dumpsters overflow with the day\\'s garbage. A pillar of\\nsteam rises from an underground grate. It\\'s the dark\\nplace between buildings that a reasonable person avoids.\\nWe see JAKE VIG, a guy in his late 20\\'s whose fashionable\\nsuit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the\\nsurroundings-- At first glance, you\\'d think he could run\\nfor Congress some day.  At first glance.\\nJake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution\\nstyle. His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling\\nin a strawberry field.\\n<b>                       JAKE (V.O.)\\n</b>           And I think it\\'s because of this\\n           redhead...\\n<b>                       BUTCH (O.S.)\\n</b>           Know who I am, Jake?\\n<b>                       JAKE\\n</b>           The Anti-Christ?\\n<b>                       BUTCH (O.S.)\\n</b>           No. I\\'m not the Anti-Christ. Or the\\n           Prince of Darkness. I\\'m just a guy\\n           looking for some answers.\\nThere\\'s the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE \"CLICK\" of a gun being\\ncocked. The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jake\\'s\\near and comes to rest at the base of his skull.\\nThe voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40\\'s). With his\\nsuit and conservative looks, you\\'d make him out for a\\n\"Steve\" or \"Roger\" more than a \"Butch\".\\n                       BUTCH (cont\\' d)\\n           Things are probably going to end badly\\n           for you, Jake.\\n<b>                       JAKE\\n</b>           Gee...
